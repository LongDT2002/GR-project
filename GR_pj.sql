She attended the University of Minnesota. As she says in her autobiography, My Life in High Heels, her father was originally going to name her \"Leiloni,\" but then realized to his horror that when she got to her teen years it was liable to be twisted into \"Lay Loni.\" So it was changed to just plain \"Loni.\"\n\n Anderson\'s most famous acting role came as receptionist Jennifer Marlowe on WKRP in Cincinnati. Her pinup photo in a bikini became one of the best-selling wall posters of the 1970s. She and husband Burt Reynolds made one film together, the 1983 stock-car racing comedy Stroker Ace, a huge box-office failure.  Shortly after her divorce from Reynolds, she appeared as a regular in the final season (1993–1994) on the NBC sitcom Nurses. Anderson portrayed actress Jayne Mansfield in a made-for-TV biopic with Arnold Schwarzenegger as her husband, Mickey Hargitay. She teamed with Lynda Carter in a 1984 television series, Partners in Crime.  Anderson made a series of cameo appearances on television shows in the late 1990s and early 2000s, such as the Spellmans\' \"witch-trash\" cousin on Sabrina, the Teenage Witch and Vallery Irons\' mother on V.I.P.  Anderson has been married four times; her first three marriages were to: Bruce Hasselberg (1964–1966), Ross Bickell (1973–1981), and actor (and one-time co-star) Burt Reynolds (1988–1993). On May 17, 2008, Anderson married musician Bob Flick, one of the founding members of the folk band The Brothers Four. The couple had met at a movie premiere in Anderson\'s native Minneapolis a few years after Flick\'s group hit No. 2 on the pop charts with \"Greenfields\" in 1960. The ceremony was attended by friends and family, including son Quinton Reynolds.  She has two children: a daughter, Deidra Hoffman (from her first marriage), who is a school administrator in California; and a son, Quinton Anderson Reynolds (born August 31, 1988), whom she and Burt Reynolds adopted. Her autobiography, My Life in High Heels, was published in 1997. Anderson is currently a practicing Lutheran.

Since his parents were very occupied with their careers, he and his three sisters (one older, two younger) were raised mostly by nannies. At the age of 15, Hauer ran off to sea and spent a year scrubbing decks aboard a freighter. Returning home, he worked as an electrician and a carpenter for three years while attending acting classes at night school. He went on to join an experimental troupe, with which he remained for five years before he was cast in the lead role in the very successful 1969 television series Floris, a Dutch Ivanhoe-like medieval action drama. The role made him famous in his native country.\n\nHauer\'s career changed course when director Paul Verhoeven cast him as the lead in Turkish Delight (1973) (based on the Jan Wolkers book of the same name). The movie found box-office favour abroad as well as at home, and within two years, its star was invited to make his English-language debut in the British film The Wilby Conspiracy (1975). Set in South Africa and starring Michael Caine and Sidney Poitier, the film was an action melodrama with a focus on apartheid. Hauer\'s supporting role, however, was barely noticed in Hollywood, and he returned to Dutch films for several years. Hauer made his American debut in the Sylvester Stallone vehicle Nighthawks (1981), cast as a psychopathic and cold-blooded terrorist named \"Wolfgar\" (after a character in the Old English poem Beowulf). The following year, he appeared in arguably his most famous and acclaimed role as the eccentric, violent, yet sympathetic replicant Roy Batty in Ridley Scott\'s 1982 sci-fi thriller, Blade Runner.\n\nHauer was a dedicated environmentalist. He fought for the release of Greenpeace\'s co-founder, Paul Watson, who was convicted in 1994 for sinking a Norwegian whaling vessel.

Burke landed his second chance in a Hollywood starring role with the Stephen King adaptation \"Thinner\" (1996), but the macabre tale, which featured him under heavy makeup to depict a callous man who magically loses weight, was deemed almost universally unlikable.Though Burke\'s leading-man days were mostly behind him, his beastly role in Hartley\'s \"No Such Thing\" (2001) aside, he soldiered on, and began increasingly working on television with recurring roles on the grim prison drama \"Oz\" and the police procedural \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" (NBC, 1999- ). Appearing in George Clooney\'s first two movies as director, \"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\" (2002) and \"Good Night, and Good Luck.\" (2005), Burke nonetheless became more familiar to TV audiences, particularly when he signed on to play Mickey Gavin, the ex-priest cousin of Denis Leary\'s lead character on the firefighter series \"Rescue Me,\" a part that dovetailed with Burke\'s real-life second job as a New York State fireman.Often cast as a tough guy, the ruggedly handsome and tall actor continued to play imposing figures such as Major General James \"Chaos\" Mattis in the Iraq War miniseries \"Generation Kill\" (HBO, 2008) and Bart Bass, the controlling billionaire father of Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) on the soapy drama \"Gossip Girl.\" Before long, he was juggling his ongoing \"Law & Order: SVU\" part with regular spots on the military drama \"Army Wives\" (Lifetime, 2007- ) and the tense crime show \"Person of Interest\" (CBS, 2011- ), while still finding time for supporting turns in films, including the Denzel Washington/Mark Wahlberg action movie \"2 Guns\" (2013).','1960-09-12',NULL),(544,'Jayakrishnan',NULL,'',NULL,NULL),(545,'Peter Cena',NULL,'',NULL,NULL),(546,'Jin Au-Yeung','Miami, Florida, USA','Jin Au-Yeung (born June 4, 1982), known professionally as MC Jin, is an American rapper, songwriter, and actor of Hakka descent.

(1968), 100 Rifles (1969), Myra Breckinridge (1970), Hannie Caulder (1971), Kansas City Bomber (1972), The Last of Sheila (1973), The Three Musketeers (1973), The Wild Party (1975), and Mother, Jugs & Speed (1976). She made several television variety specials.\n\nThrough her portrayal of strong female characters, helping her break the mold of the traditional sex symbol, Welch developed a unique film persona that made her an icon of the 1960s and 1970s. Her rise to stardom in the mid-1960s was partly credited with ending Hollywood\'s vigorous promotion of the blonde bombshell.[1][2][3] Her love scene with Jim Brown in 100 Rifles also made cinematic history with their portrayal of interracial intimacy.[4] She won a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture Actress in a Musical or Comedy in 1974 for her performance as Constance Bonacieux in The Three Musketeers and reprised the role in its sequel the following year. She was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Television Film for her performance in Right to Die (1987). Her final film was How to Be a Latin Lover (2017). In 1995, Welch was chosen by Empire magazine as one of the \"100 Sexiest Stars in Film History\". Playboy ranked Welch No. 3 on their \"100 Sexiest Stars of the Twentieth Century\" list.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Raquel Welch, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.','1940-09-05','2023-02-15'),(636,'Roy Yerbey',NULL,'',NULL,NULL),(637,'Bill Moseley','Barrington, Illinois, USA','From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nWilliam \"Bill\" Moseley (born November 11, 1951) is an American film actor and musician who has starred in a number of cult classic horror films, including House of 1000 Corpses, Repo!

Asked how to pronounce her adopted surname, she told The Literary Digest: \"My fake name is properly pronounced vor\'shack. The D remains silent.\"\n\nDvorak was the daughter and only child of silent film actress Anna Lehr and director Edwin McKim. While in New York, she attended St. Catherine\'s Convent. After moving to California, she attended Page School for Girls in Hollywood.\n\nShe made her film debut when she was five years old in the silent film version of Ramona (1916), credited as \"Baby Anna Lehr\". She continued in children\'s roles in The Man Hater (1917) and Five Dollar Plate (1920), but then stopped acting in films. Her parents separated in 1916 and divorced in 1920; she did not see her father again until 13 years later, when she made a public plea to the press to help her find him.\n\nIn the late 1920s, Dvorak worked as a dance instructor and gradually began to appear on film as a chorus girl. Her friend, actress Karen Morley, introduced her to billionaire movie producer Howard Hughes, who groomed her as a dramatic actress. She was a success in such pre-Code films as Scarface (1932) as Paul Muni\'s sister; in Three on a Match (1932) with Bette Davis and Joan Blondell as the doomed, unstable Vivian; in The Crowd Roars (1932) with James Cagney; and in Sky Devils (1932) opposite Spencer Tracy. Known for her style and elegance, she was a popular leading lady for Warner Bros. during the 1930s, and appeared in numerous contemporary romances and melodramas.  At age 19, Dvorak eloped with Leslie Fenton, her English co-star from The Strange Love of Molly Louvain (1932), and they married on March 17, 1932. They left for a year-long honeymoon in spite of her contractual obligations to the studio, which led to a period of litigation and pay disputes during which she discovered she was making the same amount of money as the boy who played her son in Three on a Match. She completed her contract on permanent suspension, then worked as a freelancer. Although she worked regularly, the quality of her scripts declined sharply.  She appeared as secretary Della Street to Donald Woods\' Perry Mason in The Case of the Stuttering Bishop (1937). With her then-husband, Leslie Fenton, Dvorak traveled to England where she supported the war effort by working as an ambulance driver and acted in several British films. She appeared as a saloon singer in Abilene Town with Randolph Scott and Edgar Buchanan, released in 1946. The following year she adeptly handled comedy by giving an assured performance in Out of the Blue (1947). In 1948, Dvorak gave her only performance on Broadway in The Respectful Prostitute.\n\nDvorak\'s marriage to Fenton ended in divorce in 1946. In 1947, she married Igor Dega, a Russian dancer who danced with her briefly in The Bachelor\'s Daughters. The marriage ended two years later.\n\nDvorak retired from the screen in 1951, when she married her third and last husband, Nicholas Wade, to whom she remained married until his death in 1975.

He specialized in playing the rugged heroes of B Westerns, particularly the Red Ryder series of films.  By 1925, he was getting occasional extra work in films. He took classes at the Pasadena Playhouse and appeared in a few stage roles there. By 1927, he had made his first Western, The Arizona Wildcat, playing his first featured role. Several co-starring roles followed, and he renamed himself Gordon Elliott. But as the studios made the transition to sound films, he slipped back into roles as an extra and bit parts, as in Broadway Scandals, in 1929. For the next eight years, he appeared in over a hundred films for various studios, but almost always in unbilled parts as an extra.\n\nElliott began to be noticed in some minor B Westerns, enough so that Columbia Pictures offered him the title role in a serial, The Great Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok (1938). The serial was so successful, and Elliott so personable, that Columbia promoted him to starring in his own series of Western features, replacing Columbia\'s number-two cowboy star Robert \"Tex\" Allen. Henceforth Gordon Elliott would be known as Bill Elliott. Within two years, he was among the Motion Picture Herald\'s Top Ten Western Stars, where he would remain for the next 15 years.\n\nIn 1943, Elliott signed with Republic Pictures, which cast him in a series of Westerns alongside George \"Gabby\" Hayes. The first of these, Calling Wild Bill Elliott, gave Elliott the name by which he would be best known and by which he would be billed almost exclusively for the rest of his career.\n\nFollowing several films in which both actor and character shared the name Wild Bill Elliott, he took the role for which he would be best remembered, that of Red Ryder in a series of sixteen movies about the famous comic strip cowboy and his young Indian companion, Little Beaver (played in Elliott\'s films by Bobby Blake). Elliott played the role for only two years but would forever be associated with it. Elliott\'s trademark was a pair of six guns worn butt-forward in their holsters.\n\nElliott\'s career thrived during and after the Red Ryder films, and he continued making B Westerns into the early 1950s. He also had his own radio show during the late 1940s. His final contract as a Western star was with Monogram Pictures, where budgets declined as the B Western lost its audience to television. When Monogram became Allied Artists Pictures Corporation in 1953, it phased out its Western productions, and Elliott finished out his contract playing a homicide detective in a series of five modern police dramas, his first non-Westerns since 1938.\n\nElliott retired from films (except for a couple of TV Western pilots which were not picked up). He worked for a time as a spokesman for Viceroy cigarettes and hosted a local TV program in Las Vegas, Nevada, which featured many of his Western films.','1904-10-16','1965-11-26'),(959,'Kimberly Battista',NULL,'',NULL,NULL),(960,'Shakti Singh',NULL,'',NULL,NULL),(961,'Vivian Lee',NULL,'',NULL,NULL),(962,'Martin Palmer','Binghamton, New York, USA','','1959-11-04',NULL),(963,'Peter J.

He directed and starred in Easy Rider (1969), winning an award at the Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay as co-writer. \"With its portrait of counterculture heroes raising their middle fingers to the uptight middle-class hypocrisies, Easy Rider became the cinematic symbol of the 1960s, a celluloid anthem to freedom, macho bravado and anti-establishment rebellion.\" Film critic Matthew Hays notes that \"no other persona better signifies the lost idealism of the 1960s than that of Dennis Hopper.\" He was unable to build on his success for several years, until a featured role in Apocalypse Now (1979) brought him attention.

Chan is also a Cantopop and Mandopop star, having released a number of albums and sung many of the theme songs for the films in which he has starred.\n\nChan was born on April 7, 1954, in Victoria Peak, in the former Crown colony of Hong Kong, as Chan Kong-sang (meaning \"born in Hong Kong\") to Charles and Lee-Lee Chan, refugees from the Chinese Civil War. He was nicknamed Paopao (Chinese: 炮炮, literally meaning \"Cannonball\") because he was such a big baby, weighing 12 pounds, or about 5.4 kgs. Since his parents worked for the French Consul to Hong Kong, Chan spent his formative years within the grounds of the consul\'s residence in the Victoria Peak district. Chan attended the Nah-Hwa Primary School on Hong Kong Island, where he failed his first year, after which his parents withdrew him from the school.\n\nIn 1960, his father immigrated to Canberra, Australia, to work as the head cook for the American embassy, and Chan was sent to the China Drama Academy, a Peking Opera School run by Master Yu Jim-yuen. Chan trained rigorously for the next decade, excelling in martial arts and acrobatics. He eventually became part of the Seven Little Fortunes, a performance group made up of the school\'s best students, gaining the stage name Yuen Lo in homage to his master. Chan became close friends with fellow group members Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, the three of them later to be known as the Three Brothers or Three Dragons. At the age of 17, he worked as a stuntman in the Bruce Lee films Fist of Fury and Enter the Dragon under the stage name Chan Yuen Lung. He received his first starring role later that year, in Little Tiger of Canton, which had a limited release in Hong Kong in 1973.','1954-04-07',NULL),(1170,'Avery Konrad',NULL,'','1994-12-28',NULL),(1171,'Rico Ball',NULL,'',NULL,NULL),(1172,'Rokkaku Seiji','Hyogo, Japan','Seiji Rokkaku was born on June 24, 1962 in Himeji, Japan.

After the end of the Second World War Preiss returned to the theatre, and from 1949 worked extensively dubbing films into German.\n\nIn 1954 he returned to film acting, appearing in Alfred Weidenmann\'s Canaris. The following year Preiss played the lead role of Claus von Stauffenberg in Falk Harnack\'s film Der 20. Juli, which dramatised the 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler. This role brought Preiss to popular attention and also the 1956 Federal Film Award.\n\nFrom now on Preiss was largely typecast in the role of the upright and obligation-conscious German officer to the other A-list actor playing the Fanatic (I.E. Paul Scofeld in The Train) a part he played in many films, later reprising it in numerous international productions, predominantly in Italy and the USA, while occasionally playing a more typically cynical or brutal Nazi officer.\n\nPreiss appeared in such productions as The Longest Day (1962), Otto Preminger\'s The Cardinal (1963), and with Jean-Paul Belmondo in Is Paris Burning?

Despite this, a stunning performance in her debut drama serial, Beyond Dawn (女子监狱), left an indelible impression in the hearts of viewers.

Through this action flick, she won attention in the Asian media and is noted to have a high potential in local book Singapore Cinema by Raphaël Millet. She subsequently followed this up with a supporting role as a policewoman in another Raintree Pictures film, The Tree (孩子树).\n\nHer recording of the theme song of her earlier drama, The Other Parent (妈妈先生) and Mind Games (危险人物) marked the start of a nascent career in singing. She then released her debut album, Phyllis, under Hype Records which contained primarily dance tunes and singles from the soundtrack of The Tree and Beyond The Axis Of Truth (法医X档案). To promote her album, Phyllis guest starred in a Channel 5\'s crime drama series Heartlanders 2 where she played a stalked actress.

His portrayal of serious characters seemingly oblivious to (and complicit in) their absurd surroundings gave him a reputation as a comedian. In the final years of his career, Nielsen appeared in multiple spoof and parody films, many of which were met poorly by critics, but performed well in box office and home media releases.

Among his many roles, Nolan is remembered for originating the role of private investigator Michael Shayne in a series of 1940s B movies.\n\nNolan was born in San Francisco, California, the son of Margaret and James Nolan, who was a shoe manufacturer of Irish descent. He attended Santa Clara Preparatory School and Stanford University, flunking out of Stanford as a freshman \"because I never got around to attending any other class but dramatics.\" His parents disapproved of his choice of a career in acting, preferring that he join his father\'s shoe business, \"one of the most solvent commercial firms in San Francisco.\"\n\nNolan served in the United States Merchant Marine before joining the Dennis Players theatrical troupe in Cape Cod.

Not surprisingly, his physical prowess led to an early role in The Quarterback (1926) with Richard Dix. MacLane once commented that, as an actor, he needed to have the physical strength to tear the bad guys \"from limb to limb\", if necessary. Ironically, it was usually Barton himself who was destined to be at the end of a hiding (when not getting shot, instead), typically as snarling henchmen, outlaws and other assorted dubious or abrasive types throughout most of his 40-year acting career. In fact, Barton became so typecast that his name was for a time used proverbially, to generally describe a shouting, hard-nosed ruffian.\n\nAfter training at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, MacLane joined a stock company in Brooklyn. In 1927 he had his first part on Broadway, a brief moment as an assistant district attorney, in the melodrama \"The Trial of Mary Dugan\". He then played a small featured role as a police officer in \"Subway Express\" (1929-30), a drama enacted in the interior of a subway car. In mid-1932 MacLane tried his hand at writing his own starring vehicle for the stage, entitled \"Rendezvous\". While the play closed after just 21 performances, it led to a contract with Warner Brothers.\n\nBarton had already appeared in bit roles for Paramount at their Astoria Studios, including The Marx Brothers\' debut film The Cocoanuts (1929). He portrayed mobster Brad Collins in \'G\' Men (1935) (with James Cagney), which set the tone for most of his future assignments. Brawny, with squinty eyes and a rasping voice, MacLane was the ideal surly tough guy, particularly suitable for westerns and the type of films noir Warner Brothers excelled at. He was often cast as cops, be they bent or honest. Some of his most representative performances include gangster Al Kruger in Bullets or Ballots (1936), which won him some of the best critical notices of his career; outlaw Jack Slade in Western Union (1941); crooked construction boss Pat McCormick, who gets beaten up by Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt over past-due wages in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948); hard-nosed cops Detective Dundy in The Maltese Falcon (1941) and Lt. Reece in Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye (1950). MacLane, on loan to Universal, also had a starring role in Prison Break (1938) as an innocent tuna fisherman who is framed for murder. He was prominent as a tough but sympathetic cop, foil to sleuthing girl reporter Glenda Farrell in the \"Torchy Blaine\" series of the mid- to late 1930s. In the 1960s Barton began to cultivate a good-guy image as Marshal Frank Caine in the NBC western series Outlaws (1960) as well as showing up in a small recurring role as Air Force Gen. Martin Peterson in I Dream of Jeannie (1965).\n\nBarton was married to the actress Charlotte Wynters, who appeared with him in six of his films. When not on the set, the couple spent time on their 2000-acre cattle ranch in Madera County, California.\n\nFor his work in television, Barton has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.','1902-12-25','1969-01-01'),(1426,'James Bradford','Wimbledon, Surrey, England, UK','','1938-01-01',NULL),(1427,'Ashley Campbell',NULL,'',NULL,NULL),(1428,'Michael Ealy','Washington, District of Columbia, USA','Michael Brown (born August 3, 1973), professionally known as Michael Ealy, was born on August 3, 1973 in Silver Spring, Maryland.

James Wilson Flavin Jr. was the son of a hotel waiter of Canadian-English extraction and a mother, Katherine, whose father was an Irish immigrant. (Thus Flavin, well-known in Hollywood as an \"Irish\" type, was only one-quarter Irish.) Flavin was born and raised in Portland, Maine (a fact that may have enrichened his later working relationship with director John Ford, also a Portland native). He attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, but (contrary to some sources) did not graduate. Instead he dropped out and returned to Portland where he drove a taxi. Then as now, summer stock companies flocked to Maine each year, and in 1929 he was asked to fill in for an actor. He did well with the part and the company manager offered him $150 per week to go with the troupe back to New York. Flavin accepted and by the spring of 1930 was living in a rooming house at 108 W. 87th Street in Manhattan. Flavin didn\'t manage to crack Broadway at this time (his Broadway debut would not occur for another thirty-nine years, in the 1971 revival of \"The Front Page,\" in which Flavin played Murphy and briefly took over the lead role of Walter Burns from star Robert Ryan). He worked his way across the country in stock productions and tours, arriving in Los Angeles around 1932. He quickly made the transition to movies, landing the lead in his very first film, a Universal serial, The Airmail Mystery (1932). He also landed his leading lady, marrying the serial\'s female star Lucile Browne that same year. However, the serial marked virtually the last time that Flavin would play the lead in a film. Thereafter, he was restricted almost exclusively to supporting characters, many of them without so much as a name. He specialized in uniformed cops and hard-bitten detectives, but played chauffeurs, cabbies, and even a 16th-century palace guard with aplomb. Flavin appeared in nearly four hundred films between 1932 and 1971, and in almost a hundred television episodes before his final appearance, as President Dwight D. Eisenhower in Francis Gary Powers: The True Story of the U-2 Spy Incident (1976). Flavin died of a heart ailment at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on April 23, 1976. His widow Lucile died seventeen days later. They were survived by their son, William James Flavin, subsequently a professor at the United States Army War College.

His father was half French, half Cherokee Indian. One of five children, his father died and his mother could not raise five children alone. Along with another brother, they both admitted to the Indiana Soldiers\' and Sailors\' Children\'s Home. This did not stop him working his way through to Purdue University.\n\nWhen growing up, Blue built up his physique to become a football player (he grew to six feet three inches tall). He not only played football, but he was also a fireman, railroad worker, coal miner, cowpuncher, ranch hand, circus rider, lumberjack, and finally, a day laborer at the studios of D. W. Griffith.\n\nHe had no theatrical experience when he came to the screen. In his first movie, The Birth of a Nation (1915), he was a stuntman and an extra in the movie. In his next movie, he starred in another small part in the movie, Intolerance (1916). Gradually moving to supporting roles for both D. W. Griffith and Cecil B. DeMille, Blue earned his breakthrough role as Danton in Orphans of the Storm, starring sisters, Lillian Gish and Dorothy Gish. Then he rose to stardom as a rugged romantic lead along with top leading actresses such as Clara Bow, Gloria Swanson, and Norma Shearer. His most prolific female screen partner was Marie Prevost with whom he made several films in the mid 20s at Warner Brothers. Blue\'s finest silent screen performance was as the alcoholic doctor who finds paradise in MGM\'s White Shadows in the South Seas (1928). Blue became one of the few silent stars to survive the talkie revolution. However, he lost his investments in the stock market crash of 1929.\n\nHe rebuilt his career as a character actor, working until his retirement in 1954. One of his more memorable roles was the sheriff in Key Largo. He divorced his first wife in 1923 and married Tova Jansen in 1924. He had two children, Barbara Ann and Richard Monte.

Brown, and Ellery Queen: Master Detective (1939).\n\nNeumann was signed by producer Hal Roach in 1941 to direct a series of \"streamliners\", 45-minute features designed to fill out short double bills. Among these 4-reel comedies were About Face (1942), Brooklyn Orchid (1942), Taxi, Mister? (1943) and Yanks Ahoy (1943).\n\nIn 1945, he joined the company of producer Sol Lesser, who engaged Neumann as coproducer and principal director of the Tarzan series produced by Lesser 1945-1954. The Tarzan films were produced for RKO and starred Johnny Weissmuller and later Gordon Scott.\n\nNeumann became known as a specialist in science fiction movies due to his producing and directing such productions as Rocketship X-M (1950) and The Fly (1958). Neumann directed other sci-fi and horror films such as Kronos (1957) and She-Devil (1957), and directed non-scifi films such as The Ring (1952) an independent feature co-starring Rita Moreno, Carnival Story (1954), Mohawk (1956), and The Deerslayer (1957)\n\nContrary to some published reports, Neumann did not die as a result of suicide, but, rather, from natural causes in Los Angeles on 21 August 1958, shortly after a preview screening of The Fly but before the official premiere. Thus, Neumann never knew what a boxoffice hit The Fly was.

He is the only author to have won the Prix Goncourt under two names. He is considered a major writer of French literature of the second half of the 20th century. He was married to Lesley Blanch, then Jean Seberg.\n\nGary was born Roman Kacew (Yiddish: רומן קצב Roman Katsev, Russian: Рома́н Ле́йбович Ка́цев, Roman Leibovich Katsev) in Vilnius (at that time in the Russian Empire). In his books and interviews, he presented many different versions of his parents\' origins, ancestry, occupation and his own childhood. His mother, Mina Owczyńska (1879—1941), was a Jewish actress from Švenčionys (Svintsyán) and his father was a businessman named Arieh-Leib Kacew (1883—1942) from Trakai (Trok), also a Lithuanian Jew. The couple broke in 1925 and Arieh-Leib remarried. Gary later claimed that his actual father was the celebrated actor and film star Ivan Mosjoukine, with whom his actress mother had worked and to whom he bore a striking resemblance. Mosjoukine appears in his memoir Promise at Dawn. Deported to central Russia in 1915, they stayed in Moscow until 1920. They later returned to Vilnius, then moved on to Warsaw. When Gary was fourteen, he and his mother emigrated illegally to Nice, France. Converted to Catholicism by his mother, Gary studied law, first in Aix-en-Provence and then in Paris. He learned to pilot an aircraft in the French Air Force in Salon-de-Provence and in Avord Air Base, near Bourges. ...\n\nSource: Article \"Romain Gary\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.','1914-05-21','1980-12-02'),(9,'Olivier Van Hoofstadt','Brussels, Belgium','Olivier Van Hoofstadt is a Belgian screenwriter and film director.',NULL,NULL),(10,'Norman Z.

Jeunet also directed numerous advertisements and music videos, such as Jean Michel Jarre\'s Zoolook (together with Caro).\n\nJeunet\'s films often resonate with the late twentieth century French film movement, cinéma du look, and allude to themes and aesthetics involving German expressionism, French poetic realism, and the French New Wave.\n\nJeunet and Caro\'s first feature film was Delicatessen (1991), a melancholy comedy set in a famine-plagued post-apocalyptic world, in which an apartment building above a delicatessen is ruled by a butcher who kills people in order to feed his tenants.\n\nThey next made The City of Lost Children (1995), a dark, multi-layered fantasy film about a mad scientist who steals children\'s dreams so that he can live indefinitely.[3] The success of The City of Lost Children led to an invitation to direct the fourth film in the Alien series, Alien: Resurrection (1997). This is where Jeunet and Caro ended up going their separate ways as Jeunet believed this to be an amazing opportunity and Caro was not interested in a film that lacked creative control working on a big-budget Hollywood movie. Caro ended up assisting for a few weeks, with costumes and set design but afterwards, decided to work on a solo career in illustration and computer graphics.\n\nJeunet directed Amélie (2001), starring Audrey Tautou. Amélie is the story of a woman who takes pleasure in doing good deeds but has trouble finding love herself, was a huge critical and commercial success worldwide and was nominated for several Academy Awards. For this film, Jeunet also gained a European Film Award for Best Director.\n\nJeunet has also directed numerous commercials including a 2\'25\" film for Chanel N° 5 featuring his frequent collaborator Audrey Tautou.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jean-Pierre Jeunet, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.','1953-09-03',NULL),(230,'Matt Nable','Sydney, Australia.','Matthew Nable (born 8 March 1972) is an Australian film and television actor, writer and former professional rugby league footballer After playing in the Winfield Cup Premiership during the 1990s for the Manly-Warringah and South Sydney clubs, he wrote and starred in the rugby league-centered drama The Final Winter in 2007.

After graduating from Brown University, he went to Yale School of Drama, where he met his future wife, Mary Dickson.\n\nHis film career began in 1942 at the RKO studio, directing shorts, documentaries, and compilations of forgotten silent features.\n\nFleischer moved to Los Angeles and was assigned his first feature, Child of Divorce (1946).  In 1954, he was chosen by Walt Disney (his father\'s former rival as a cartoon producer) to direct 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea starring Kirk Douglas.  In 1955 Fox signed Fleischer to a long term contract. He would work for that studio for the next fifteen years. His first film under his new contract with Fox was The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing (1955). Kirk Douglas hired Fleischer to make The Vikings (1958), which was another big hit.  He then moved to Paris where he directed two stories for Darryl F. Zanuck starring Greco. Fleischer then signed a contract with Dino de Laurentiis to make Barabbas (1962).  Back in Hollywood, Richard Zanuck had become head of production at Fox and offered Fleischer Fantastic Voyage (1966). It was a success and resurrected his Hollywood career.  Che! (1969), a biopic of Che Guevera that starred Omar Sharif, was an expensive flop, as was an account of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970). This was his last film for 20th Century Fox.\n\nFleischer travelled to England, where he directed an acclaimed thriller, 10 Rillington Place. See No Evil (1971) with Mia Farrow was another thriller. In Hollywood, he made The New Centurions (1972). At MGM, he made a science-fiction film, Soylent Green (1973), with Charlton Heston.\n\nHe was reunited with De Laurentiis for the popular, if controversial, Mandingo (1975).  The Prince and the Pauper (1977) was a version of the Mark Twain novel that featured Heston, Harrison and Scott in its cast. Fleischer was then hired on Ashanti (1979), starring Michael Caine, which turned out to be a flop.  Tough Enough (1983) was about the Toughman Contest starring Dennis Quaid. He made three more for de Laurentiis. His final theatrical feature was Million Dollar Mystery (1987).\n\nFleischer was chairman of Fleischer Studios, which today handles the licensing of Betty Boop and Koko the Clown. In June 2005, he released his memoirs of his father\'s career in Out of the Inkwell: Max Fleischer and the Animation Revolution.\n\nFleischer\'s 1993 autobiography, Just Tell Me When to Cry, described his many difficulties with actors, writers and producers.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Richard O.

Jandreau later starred in the film playing a fictionalised version of himself as Brady Blackburn. The film premiered at Cannes Film Festival as part of the Directors\' Fortnight selection and won the Art Cinema Award.

Several other \"art\" films followed, including the adaptation of Mart Crowley\'s \"The Boys in the Band\" and most notably \"The Birthday Party,\" based on an unpublished screenplay by Harold Pinter, which he adapted from his own play. Friedkin, however, did not want to be known as an art house director, but rather for action and serious drama through stories about an America upended by crime, hypocrisy, the occult, and amorality. All of which he mounted up into his films to reflect what was going on in an America that was changing in the wake of Vietnam, the Sexual Revolution, and Watergate.\n\nIn 1971, his \"The French Connection\" was released to wide critical acclaim. Shot in a gritty style more suited for documentaries than Hollywood features, the film won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. Friedkin followed up with 1973\'s \"The Exorcist,\" based on William Peter Blatty\'s best-selling novel, which revolutionized the horror genre and is considered by some critics to be one of the greatest horror movies of all time. \"The Exorcist\" was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. It won the Best Screenplay and Best Sound Mixing.\n\nFollowing these two pictures, Friedkin, along with Francis Ford Coppola and Peter Bogdanovich, was deemed one of the premier directors of New Hollywood. In 1973, the trio announced the formation of an independent production company at Paramount, The Directors Company. Whereas Coppola directed \"The Conversation\" and Bogdanovich the Henry James adaptation, \"Daisy Miller,\" Friedkin abruptly left the company, which was soon closed by Paramount.  Friedkin\'s later movies did not achieve the same success. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Friedkin\'s films received mostly lackluster reviews and moderate ticket sales. However, his action/crime movie \"To Live and Die in L.A.\" (1985), starring William Petersen and Willem Dafoe, was a critical favorite and drew comparisons to Friedkin\'s own \"The French Connection\" (particularly for its car-chase sequence). In 2011, Friedkin directed \"Killer Joe,\" a black comedy written by Tracy Letts, and starring Matthew McConaughey.

Indeed, the surreal and in many cases violent elements to his films have earned them the reputation that they \"disturb, offend or mystify\" their audiences.\n\nMoving around various parts of the United States as a child within his middle class family, Lynch went on to study painting in Philadelphia, where he first made the transition to producing short films. Deciding to devote himself more fully to this medium, he moved to Los Angeles, where he produced his first motion picture, the surrealist horror Eraserhead (1977). After Eraserhead became a cult classic on the midnight movie circuit, Lynch was employed to direct The Elephant Man (1980), from which he gained mainstream success. Then being employed by the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, he proceeded to make two films. First, the science-fiction epic Dune (1984), which proved to be a critical and commercial failure, and then a neo-noir crime film, Blue Velvet (1986), which was highly critically acclaimed.\n\nProceeding to create his own television series with Mark Frost, the highly popular murder mystery Twin Peaks (1990–1992), he also created a cinematic prequel, Fire Walk With Me (1992), a road movie, Wild at Heart (1990), and a family film, The Straight Story (1999) in the same period. Turning further towards surrealist filmmaking, three of his following films worked on \"dream logic\" non-linear narrative structures, Lost Highway (1997), Mulholland Drive (2001) and Inland Empire (2006).\n\nLynch has received three Academy Award nominations for Best Director, for his films The Elephant Man, Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive, and also received a screenplay Academy Award nomination for The Elephant Man. Lynch has twice won France\'s César Award for Best Foreign Film, as well as the Palme d\'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and a Golden Lion award for lifetime achievement at the Venice Film Festival.

His work is known for its clean lines, which are elegant and singularly strong. He exhibited his own glass in a luxurious store located at 2 Avenue Victor-Emmanuel III, at the roundabout of the Champs Èlysées in Paris. Etienne Franckhauser, who also made molds for Lalique and Sabino, made the molds for Hunebelle\'s glass which was fabricated by the crystal factory in Choisy-le-Roi, France. Hunebelle\'s store ceased all activity in 1938 prior to World War II.\n\nHunebelle pieces are marked in several ways. The most common is A.HUNEBELLE-FRANCE in molded capitals either within the glass design or on the base. Other pieces are marked simply A.HUNEBELLE. There was also a paper label with A and H superimposed in a stylized manner. Since paper labels are frequently lost, many pieces may appear completely unmarked. In the author\'s collection there are pieces marked A.HUNEBELLE both with and without the word FRANCE, and a bowl marked MADE IN FRANCE that is identical to one shown in a Hunebelle catalogue. Hunebelle also used a more elaborate maker\'s mark imprinted on some glass pieces which had the word FRANCE encircled by the words MADE IN FRANCE MODELLE DEPOSE et R COGNEVILLE and with A. HUNEBELLE underneath (reflects mid 1930s partnership with COGNEVILLE).\n\nIn a short essay, he defined his stylistic aims as a glassmaker, explaining that he wanted to be \"an adept of an abstract art where the geometric exactness, the poetry of line, and transparency are combined.\"\n\nHe also patented techniques for producing exact mouldings of items.\n\nHis glasswork displays a calculated modernism in contrast to influences derived from animals, plants and flowers which featured in the work of contemporaries such as René Lalique, Pierre D\'Avesn and Marius-Ernest Sabino at the time. Hunebelle chose to focus on geometric forms, using technique and his scientific background to enhance light emission as much as possible. Surface contrasts, volume intersections, polished-non polished effects, geometry, light and poetry of line feature prominently in his work. Hunebelle employed both mold-blown and pressed-molded techniques in producing his pieces.\n\nHunebelle was a publisher of a French newspaper called La Fleché. During World War II, he had no job until a friend Marcel Achard found him work in films for Production Artistique Cinématographique (P.A.C.) where he acted as an art director and later began producing films beginning with Leçon de conduite (1946). He directed his first film Métier de fous in 1948.\n\nHis next three films were a film series of French film noir featuring Raymond Rouleau as a journalist character mixing with crime. All three had the titles beginning with the letter \"M\" in honour of author Pierre Benoît whose heroines all began with the letter \"A\". The films were written by Michel Audiard, a crime novelist. ...\n\nSource: Article \"André Hunebelle\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.','1896-09-01','1985-11-27'),(674,'Tareq El Eryan','Kuwait','Tareq El Eryan is a Palestinian-American director and producer living and working in Cairo, Egypt.

Between 1914 and 1956, he made seventy feature films; all but seven were profitable. Cecil B. DeMille is synonymous with religious epics: The King of Kings, Samson and Delilah, and The Ten Commandments (1956). He blended spectacle, sex, and spellbinding narrative to convey a message of faith.\n\nIt was DeMille who created the image of the omnipotent director, megaphone in hand, wearing boots and a visored cap. DeMille gave Hollywood numerous stars: Wallace Reid, Gloria Swanson, William (“Hopalong Cassidy”) Boyd, Claudette Colbert, Robert Preston, Jean Arthur, and Charlton Heston.\n\nDeMille created the posts of studio story editor, art director, and concept artist. He was one of the first to use theatrical lighting on a movie set. In the late 1920s, when Hollywood converted to sound films, DeMille defied the sound experts, liberating the camera from a confining booth, and implementing the microphone boom.\n\nDeMille’s authority extended beyond the confines of his studio. He was a power in aviation, banking, politics, and real estate. In the 1930s, his fame as a filmmaker was surpassed by his fame as a radio star.\n\nHe was a founder of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, an institution from which he eventually won two awards. In 1953 his film The Greatest Show on Earth won the Award for Best Picture of 1952; and he was presented with the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award.\n\nDeMille’s influence on world culture is incalculable, but there are estimates and milestones. His biography of Jesus Christ, The King of Kings, was a silent film, but because of a unique distribution arrangement, it was eventually seen by 800 million viewers. Samson and Delilah (1949) and The Ten Commandments (1956) are still listed with the top ten all-time box-office champions.

In his films as well as his novels, while praising masculine friendships and advocating the confrontation of the individual against the world, he often championed the underworld but was always careful to hide his own links with the Nazi occupiers of France during World War II.\n\nOf Corsican descent, Joseph Damiani received a good education, studying at the Collège Stanislas de Paris and the Lycée Janson de Sailly. His father, a professional gambler who was sentenced to a year in prison for running an illegal casino, owned a hotel in the French Alps in Chamonix. Joseph worked there as a young man and became fascinated by mountain climbing.\n\nFrom April to September 1943 Damiani was a member of Jeunesse et Montagne (Youth and Mountain) in Chamonix, part of the Vichy Government youth movement controlled by Pierre Laval.\n\nIn February 1944 Damiani came to Paris and through his father\'s friend, the LVF leader Simon Sabiani, he joined Jacques Doriot\'s fascist French Popular Party (PPF). His maternal uncle, Ange Paul Santolini alias \"Santos\", who ran a restaurant patronized by the Gestapo, and his elder brother, Paul Damiani, a member of the Vichy paramilitary Milice, introduced Joseph into the Pigalle underworld.\n\nIn March 1944 Joseph Damiani went to Marseille where he became a member of the German Schutzkorps (SK), an organization which hunted down Service du travail obligatoire - STO (Compulsory Work Service) dodgers. He served as bodyguard to its Marseille chief and took part in many arrests, often blackmailing his victims.\n\nIn Lyon, in August 1944, posing as a German police officer along with an accomplice (Orloff, a Gestapo agent who was shot for treason at the Liberation), Damiani blackmailed Joseph Gourentzeig and his brother-in-law Georges Edberg, two Jews who were in hiding. Gourentzeig had bribed a member of the Milice - a friend of Damiani’s – in an attempt to secure his parents\' release from a detention camp. They were not freed and Gourentzeig\'s father, Jacob, was shot by the Germans shortly after, on 21 August 1944, along with 109 Jewish hostages in the Bron (Lyon airport) massacre.\n\nAfter the Liberation in Paris on 18 May 1945, Joseph Damiani, his brother Paul, Georges Accad, a former Gestapo agent, and Jacques Ménassole, a former member of the Milice wearing a French Army lieutenant\'s uniform - all posing as Military Intelligence officers - abducted Haïm Cohen, a wine merchant, accusing him of being a black marketeer. He was tortured until he gave them the key to his safe and a check for 105,000 francs. He was then shot and his body thrown into the Seine.

He was born Shelton Lee in Atlanta, Georgia. At a very young age, he moved from pre-civil rights Georgia, to Brooklyn, New York. His father was a jazz musician, and his mother, a school teacher. His mother dubbed him Spike, due to his tough nature.\n\nHe attended school in Morehouse College in Atlanta and developed his film making skills at Clark Atlanta University. After graduating, he went to the Tisch School of Arts graduate film program. He made a controversial short, The Answer (1980), a reworking of D.W. Griffith\'s The Birth of a Nation (1915) -- a ten-minute film. Lee went on to produce a 45-minute film Joe\'s Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads (1983), which won a student academy award. Lee\'s next film, \"The Messenger,\" in 1984, was somewhat biographical. In 1986, Spike Lee made the film, She\'s Gotta Have It (1986), a comedy about sexual relationships. The movie was made for 175,000 dollars, and made seven million.  Since then, Lee has become a well-known, intelligent, and talented film maker. His next movie was School Daze (1988), which was set in a historically black school and focused mostly on the conflict between the school and the Fraternities, of which he was a strong critic, portraying them as materialistic, irresponsible, and uncaring.\n\nLee went on to do his landmark film, Do the Right Thing (1989), a movie specifically about his own town in Brooklyn, New York. The movie garnered an Oscar nomination, for Danny Aiello, for supporting actor. It also sparked a debate on racial relations. Lee went on to produce the jazz biopic Mo\' Better Blues (1990) which showed his talent for directing and acting, and was the first of many Spike Lee films to feature Denzel Washington.  His next film, Jungle Fever (1991), was about interracial dating. Lee\'s handling of the subject proved yet again highly controversial. Lee\'s next film was the self-titled biography of Malcolm X (1992), which had Denzel Washington portraying the civil rights leader. The movie was a success, and resulted in an Oscar nomination for Washington. His next films were the comparatively light, Crooklyn (1994), and the intense crime drama, Clockers (1995). In 1996, Lee directed two movies: the badly received comedy, Girl 6 (1996), and the politically pointed, Get on the Bus (1996), about a group of men going to the Million Man March.  His next film, He Got Game (1998), proved to be another excursion into the collegiate world as he shows the darker side of recruiting college athletes. The movie, in limited release, yet again featured Denzel Washington. In 2000 came Bamboozled which made a mockery out of television and the way African-Americans are perceived by white America and the way African-Americans perceive themselves. The movie, however, was a resounding critical success. Lee also has produced films like New Jersey Drive (1995), Tales from the Hood (1995), and Drop Squad (1994).  He also has produced and or directed movies about Huey P. Newton, Jim Brown, and has commented in many documentaries about varied subjects. Lee is an obsessive New York Knicks fan.

In 1945, Coutard was sent to participate in the French Indochina War; he lived in Vietnam for the next 11 years, working as a war photographer, eventually becoming a freelancer for Paris Match and Look. In 1956, he was approached to shoot a film by Pierre Schoendoerffer, La Passe du Diable. Coutard had never used a movie camera before, and reportedly agreed to the job because of a misunderstanding (he believed he was being hired to shoot production stills of the film).\n\nCoutard\'s first work collaboration with Jean-Luc Godard was Godard\'s first feature, À bout de souffle, shot in 1959. He was reportedly \"imposed\" on Godard by producer Georges de Beauregard; the director had already settled on a different cinematographer.\n\nCoutard photographed nearly all of Godard\'s work in the Nouvelle Vague era (1959 - 1967), with the exception of Masculin, féminin; their last work during this period was Week-end (1967), which marked the end of Godard\'s work as a \'mainstream\' filmmaker.

(1962), The Dirty Dozen (1967).\n\nBorn in Cranston, Rhode Island, the son of Lora Lawson and newspaper publisher Edward Burgess Aldrich. He was a grandson of U.S. Senator Nelson W. Aldrich and a cousin of Nelson Rockefeller. He studied economics at the University of Virginia.  In 1941, he dropped out of college for a $50-a-week job at RKO Radio Pictures. In doing so, he was also dropped by his family, losing a potential stake in Chase Bank he would have inherited. It\'s been said that \"No American film director was born as wealthy as Aldrich—and then so thoroughly cut off from family money.\"\n\nHe quickly rose in film production as an assistant director, and worked with Jean Renoir, Abraham Polonsky, Robert Rossen, Joseph Losey and Charlie Chaplin as an assistant on Limelight. He became a television director in the 1950s, directing his first feature film, Big Leaguer, in 1953. During the 1950s, Aldrich directed mostly action films like Apache and Vera Cruz with Burt Lancaster.  Aldrich soon gained recognition as an auteur filmmaker, depicting his liberal humanist thematic vision in many genres, in films such as Kiss Me Deadly (1955), a film noir classic, The Big Knife (1955), an adaptation of Clifford Odets\'s play about Hollywood business, and Attack (1956), a WWII infantry combat film exploring how U.S. Army careerism determined who attacked and who ordered the attack.\n\nIn the 1960s, he directed several commercially successful films, such as the gothic horror stories What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962), with Bette Davis and Joan Crawford as spiteful sisters and faded child-actresses, Hush… Hush, Sweet Charlotte, with Bette Davis as a Southern woman who lives in a mansion and thinks she is going insane (both Joan Crawford and Davis were to appear, but Crawford left the film); the controversial The Killing of Sister George (1968); and the hugely popular war film The Dirty Dozen (1967).\n\nThe success of The Dirty Dozen allowed him to establish his own production studio for some time, but several failures forced his return to conventionally commercial Hollywood films. Nevertheless, his humanism is evident in The Longest Yard (1974), about the rigged-game politics, and Ulzana\'s Raid (1972) an uncompromising film based on the real life break-out from an Indian reservation of a band led by chief Ulzana, the extreme violence and torture they exacted upon isolated pioneer families in the Arizona territory, and their pursuit by the US cavalry.\n\nFrom his marriage to Harriet Foster (1941–65), Robert Aldrich had four children, all of whom work in the film business: Adell, William, Alida and Kelly.  Aldrich died of kidney failure on December 5, 1983 in a Los Angeles hospital.  Film critic John Patterson summarized his career in 2012: \"He was a punchy, caustic, macho and pessimistic director, who depicted corruption and evil unflinchingly, and pushed limits on violence throughout his career.

His grandfather, Eugenio Bava (1886-1966), was a cameraman and optics effects artist during the early days of Italian silent cinema. His father, Mario Bava (1914-1980), was a legendary cinematographer, special effects designer and director. Lamberto entered the cinema as his father\'s personal assistant, starting with \"Planet of the Vampires\" (1965). Bit by bit he gained experience from his father, who made him the assistant director for most of the rest of his films. He even co-wrote the screenplay for \"Shock\" (1977), Mario\'s last theatrical film where, in poor health during the shoot, Mario often feigned illness so Lamberto could direct a few scenes, uncredited, to gain further experience.\n\nBoth Lamberto and Mario directed the made-for-TV drama \"I giochi del diavolo: La Venere d\'Ille\" (1979). Both worked on the Dario Argento horror flick \"Inferno\" (1980), for which Mario designed some of the color set pieces, including the underwater ballroom, and created all the visual special effects, while Lamberto worked as Argento\'s assistant director. Late in 1979 Lamberto made his solo directorial debut with \"Macabre\" (1980), a tense drama-horror flick loosely based on a 1977 incident in New Orleans about a woman who keeps her lover\'s severed head in her freezer. According to Lamberto, the project started by chance when producer Pupi Avati approached him to direct as well as write the screenplay, which took just six weeks to write and direct. \"Macabre\" was released in Italy in February 1980 to mixed reviews, but won him recognition by his father Mario. Just two months later Mario Bava died, and an era in Italian film making came to a close.\n\n\"Macabre\" was not a box-office hit and, as a result, Lamberto went back to assistant directing. He worked with Dario Argento again in 1982 with \"Tenebrae\" (1982). In 1983 Lamberto was offered the opportunity to direct another film, titled \"A Blade in the Dark\" (1983), which was a violent mystery thriller shot in only three weeks on a tight budget and filmed almost entirely in a producer friend\'s house. Next he directed the action-flick \"Blastfighter\" (1984), which was filmed in the state of Georgia, and immediately afterwards directed the \"Jaws\" (1975)-like thriller \"Devil Fish\" (1984), which was shot in Florida. On both films Lamberto was purely a director for hire and had nothing to do with the script or production end. He used the pseudonym of \'John Old Jr.\' for this latter film, which was a tribute to his father Mario, who often used the pseudonym \'John M. Old\'.  He enjoyed his best commercial success to date with \"Demons\" (1985), produced by Dario Argento, co-written by Dardano Sacchetti and filmed in West Berlin. This film\'s international success allowed him to co-write, produce and direct a sequel, \"Demons 2\" (1986). Lamberto returned to giallo thrillers with \"Delirium\" (1987).\n\nIn the late 1980s the Italian cinema turned moribund. Lamberto, like most of his colleagues, turned to making films for Italian television. He also directed a remake of his father\'s \"Black Sunday\" (1960), which was titled \"La maschera del demonio\" (1990).\n\nNowadays Lamberto Bava continues to divide his time between TV work and a few movies, acknowledging his inspiration from his late father, Mario.','1944-04-03',NULL),(882,'Ng See-Yuen','Shanghai，China','','1944-04-22',NULL),(883,'Guillermo del Toro','Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico','Guillermo del Toro Gómez (born 9 October 1964) is a Mexican filmmaker and author.

At the age of 31, he became a naturalized citizen.\n\nHis best known films from the pre-McCarthy period of his career were film noirs Crossfire, for which he received a Best Director Oscar nomination, and Murder, My Sweet, the latter an adaptation of Raymond Chandler\'s Farewell My Lovely. In addition, he made two World War II films: Hitler\'s Children, the story of the Hitler youth and Back to Bataan starring John Wayne.\n\nThe late 1940\'s was the time of the Second Red Scare, and Dmytryk was one of many filmmakers investigated. Summoned to appear before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), he refused to cooperate and was sent to jail. After spending several months behind bars, Dmytryk made the decision to testify again, and give the names of his fellow members in the American Communist Party as the HUAC had demanded. On April 25, 1951, Dmytryk appeared before HUAC for the second time, answering all questions. He spoke of his own Party past, a very brief membership in 1945, including the naming of twenty-six former members of left-wing groups. He explained how John Howard Lawson, Adrian Scott, Albert Maltz and others had pressured him to include communist propaganda in his films. His testimony damaged several court cases that others of the so-called \"Hollywood 10\" had filed. He recounted his experiences of the period in his revealing 1996 book, Odd Man Out: A Memoir of the Hollywood Ten (Southern Illinois University Press, Carbondale, IL).\n\nFor a time, Dmytryk moved to England, and Stanley Kramer hired him to direct a trio of low-budget films before handing Dmytryk The Caine Mutiny. He made films for major studios Columbia, 20th Century Fox, MGM and Paramount Pictures, including, among others, Raintree County, The Left Hand of God, The Young Lions, a remake of the Marlene Dietrich classic The Blue Angel, and The Carpetbaggers.

His first movie was typical of his best work: a well-acted, tightly written, deeply considered \"problem picture,\" 12 Angry Men (1957). From that point on Lumet divided his energies among other idealistic problem pictures along with literate adaptations of plays and novels, big stylish pictures, New York-based black comedies, and realistic crime dramas, including Serpico and Prince of the City. As a result of directing 12 Angry Men, he was also responsible for leading the first wave of directors who made a successful transition from TV to movies.

His parents separated soon after the family relocated to London.

After his death it was revealed by Tombstone star Kurt Russell that Cosmatos had ghost-directed the movie on Russell\'s behalf.

He explored the visual aspects of his films throughout his career, sketching each scene on paper beforehand, then carefully framing his characters during the shooting. While most directors rely on post-production editing to shape their final work, Huston instead created his films while they were being shot, with little editing needed. Some of Huston\'s films were adaptations of important novels, often depicting an \"heroic quest,\" as in Moby Dick, or The Red Badge of Courage. In many films, different groups of people, while struggling toward a common goal, would become doomed, forming \"destructive alliances,\" giving the films a dramatic and visual tension. Many of his films involved themes such as religion, meaning, truth, freedom, psychology, colonialism, and war.\n\nHuston has been referred to as \"a titan\", \"a rebel\", and a \"renaissance man\" in the Hollywood film industry.

He also supervised two animated features released through Paramount Pictures, Gulliver\'s Travels (1939) and Mr. Bug Goes to Town (1941).

He also made a significant contribution to motion picture theater architecture from the 1930s to 1950s. He is credited as the designer of the Oscar statuette in 1928.\n\nGibbons was born in Dublin, Ireland and studied at the Art Students League of New York and worked for his architect father. While at Edison Studios from 1915, he first designed a set for a film released in 1919, assisting Hugo Ballin. But, after this first foray, the studio closed, and he signed with Samuel Goldwyn in 1918. This evolved to working for Louis B. Mayer at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer from 1924 to 1956—a 32-year career.\n\nGibbons was one of the original 36 founding members of The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and oversaw the design of the Academy Awards statuette in 1928, a trophy for which he himself would be nominated 39 times, winning 11.\n\nHe retired in 1956 with about 1,500 films credited to him: however, his contract with MGM dictated that he receive credit as art director for every MGM film released in the United States, even though other designers may have done the bulk of the work. Even so, his actual hands-on art direction may have been on about 150 films.\n\nIn 1930, Gibbons married actress Dolores del Río and co-designed their house in Santa Monica, an intricate Art Deco residence influenced by Rudolf Schindler. They divorced in 1941; three years later he married actress Hazel Brooks with whom he remained until his death at the age of 67.\n\nGibbons\'s grave is in the Calvary Cemetery, East Los Angeles.','1893-03-23','1960-07-26'),(1327,'Nicholas Barton',NULL,'',NULL,NULL),(1328,'Peter Wellington',NULL,'',NULL,NULL),(1329,'King Hu','Beijing, China','Hu Jinquan (29 April 1932 – 14 January 1997), better known as King Hu, was a Chinese film director and actor based in Hong Kong and Taiwan.

He recorded a number of records with Davis and on his own, for the Vocalion label in the late 1920s.\n\nPowell moved to Pittsburgh, where he found great local success as the Master of Ceremonies at the Enright Theater and the Stanley Theater. In April 1930, Warner Bros. bought up Brunswick Records which at that time owned Vocalion. Warner Bros. was sufficiently impressed by Powell\'s singing and stage presence to offer him a film contract in 1932. He made his film debut as a singing bandleader in Blessed Event. He went on to star as a boyish crooner in movie musicals such as 42nd Street, Footlight Parade, Gold Diggers of 1933, Dames, Flirtation Walk, and On the Avenue, often appearing opposite Ruby Keeler and Joan Blondell.\n\nPowell desperately wanted to expand his range but Warner Bros. wouldn\'t allow him to do so, although they did (mis)cast him in A Midsummer Night\'s Dream (1935) as Lysander. This was to be Powell\'s only Shakespearean role and one he did not want to play, feeling that he was completely wrong for the part. Finally, reaching his forties and knowing that his young romantic leading man days were behind him he lobbied to play the lead in Double Indemnity. He lost out to Fred MacMurray, another Hollywood nice guy. MacMurray’s success, however, fueled Powell’s resolve to pursue projects with greater range and in 1944, he was cast in the first of a series of films noir, as private detective Philip Marlowe in Murder, My Sweet, directed by Edward Dmytryk. The film was a big hit and Powell had successfully reinvented himself as a dramatic actor.\n\nThe following year Dmytryk and Powell re-teamed to make Cornered, a gripping, post-WWII thriller that helped define the film noir style. He became a popular \"tough guy\" lead appearing in movies such as Johnny O\'Clock and Cry Danger. But 1948 saw him step out of the brutish type when he starred in Pitfall, a film noir that sees a bored insurance company worker fall for an innocent but dangerous femme fatale, played by Lizabeth Scott. Even when he appeared in lighter fare such as The Reformer and the Redhead and Susan Slept Here (1954) he never sang in his later roles. The latter, his final onscreen appearance in a feature film, did include a dance number with costar Debbie Reynolds.\n\nFrom 1949-1953, Powell played the lead role in the National Broadcasting Company radio theater production Richard Diamond, Private Detective.

He was raised in an Army family, meaning that for most of his early life, his father — an officer in the Royal Engineers — was absent. Ridley\'s older brother, Frank, joined the Merchant Navy when he was still young and the pair had little contact. During this time the family moved around, living in (among other areas) Cumbria, Wales and Germany. He has a younger brother, Tony, also a film director. After the Second World War, the Scott family moved back to their native north-east England, eventually settling in Teesside (whose industrial landscape would later inspire similar scenes in Blade Runner). He enjoyed watching films, and his favourites include Lawrence of Arabia, Citizen Kane and Seven Samurai. Scott studied in Teesside from 1954 to 1958, at Grangefield Grammar School and later in West Hartlepool College of Art, graduating with a Diploma in Design. He progressed to an M.A. in graphic design at the Royal College of Art from 1960 to 1962.\n\nAt the RCA he contributed to the college magazine, ARK and helped to establish its film department. For his final show, he made a black and white short film, Boy and Bicycle, starring his younger brother, Tony Scott, and his father. The film\'s main visual elements would become features of Scott\'s later work; it was issued on the \'Extras\' section of The Duellists DVD. After graduation in 1963, he secured a job as a trainee set designer with the BBC, leading to work on the popular television police series Z-Cars and the science fiction series Out of the Unknown. Scott was an admirer of Stanley Kubrick early in his development as a director. For his entry to the BBC traineeship, Scott remade Paths of Glory as a short film.\n\nHe was assigned to design the second Doctor Who serial, The Daleks, which would have entailed realising the famous alien creatures. However, shortly before Scott was due to start work, a schedule conflict meant that he was replaced on the serial by Raymond Cusick.\n\nAt the BBC, Scott was placed into a director training programme and, before he left the corporation, had directed episodes of Z-Cars, its spin-off, Softly, Softly, and adventure series Adam Adamant Lives!\n\nIn 1968, Ridley and Tony Scott founded Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), a film and commercial production company.Five members of the Scott family are directors, all working for RSA. Brother Tony has been a successful film director for more than two decades; sons, Jake and Luke are both acclaimed commercials directors as is his daughter, Jordan Scott. Jake and Jordan both work from Los Angeles and Luke is based in London.\n\nIn 1995, Shepperton Studios was purchased by a consortium headed by Ridley and Tony Scott, which extensively renovated the studios while also expanding and improving its grounds.

His works include historical, romantic epics such as Chouans! and King of Hearts (Le Roi de cœur), as well as comedies with a charismatic, breezy hero ready to embark upon any adventure which comes his way, so long as it means escaping everyday modern life: Practice Makes Perfect (Le Cavaleur), The Devil by the Tail (Le Diable par la queue), The African (L\'Africain). He had links with the actor Jean-Paul Belmondo, with whom he made six films, as well as with Jean-Pierre Cassel, Philippe Noiret and Jean Rochefort.\n\nPhilippe de Broca was born on 15 March 1933 in Paris, France. He was the son of a cinema set designer and the grandson of a well-known painter, Philippe de Broca. He studied at the Paris Photography and Cinematography School (école Vaugirard), graduating in 1953. He carried out his military service with the service cinématographique des armées (army film service) in Germany and then in Algeria, directing or acting as head cameraman on short films. Greatly affected by the war he witnessed, he vowed to show life in its best light in his future films “because laughter is the best defence against upsets in life”. After his discharge from the military, he set off on a journey taking in the length of Africa in Berliet trucks before returning to Paris.\n\nHe began working as an intern with Henri Decoin, before finding assistant positions with Claude Chabrol: Bitter Reunion (Le Beau Serge), The Cousins (Les Cousins), Web of Passion (À Double Tour), François Truffaut: The 400 Blows (Les 400 Coups) and Pierre Schoendoerffer: Ramuntcho. In 1959, Claude Chabrol produced de Broca\'s first film for him, The Love Game (Les jeux de l’amour) with Jean-Pierre Cassel. De Broca went on to work with Cassel again in The Joker (Le Farceur, 1960), Five Day Lover (L’Amant de cinq jours, 1961), and Male Companion (Un Monsieur de Compagnie, 1964).\n\nDe Broca\'s first commercial success came with Swords of Blood (Cartouche), filmed in 1962. This film also saw two more names become associated with de Broca: the actor Jean-Paul Belmondo and the producer Alexandre Mnouchkine. International acclaim came with That Man from Rio (L\'Homme de Rio) in 1964, Up to His Ears (Les tribulations d\'un Chinois en Chine) in 1965, The Man from Acapulco (Le Magnifique) in 1973 and Incorrigible (L\'Incorrigible) in 1975.\n\nIn 1966, he co-wrote, directed and produced King of Hearts (Le Roi de Cœur). This parody of the Great War, which some cinema-lovers consider his masterpiece, was a commercial and personal failure, to de Broca\'s dismay. Yet it eventually achieved genuine cult-film status during the mid 1970s when it was presented in repertory movie theaters as well as non-theatrical college and university film series across the United States, eventually running for five years at the now defunct film house, the Central Square Cinemas in Cambridge, Massachusetts. ...\n\nSource: Article \"Philippe de Broca\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.','1933-03-15','2004-11-26'),(1495,'Rick Avery','New York City, New York, USA','Rick Avery is an American stuntman, stunt coordinator, actor, director and author.

He was one of the writers for the first two Dirty Harry films, received an Academy Award nomination as screenwriter of Apocalypse Now, and wrote and directed The Wind and the Lion, Conan the Barbarian and Red Dawn.\n\nHe wrote a number of iconic film lines such as \"Charlie don\'t surf\" and \"I love the smell of napalm in the morning,\" from Apocalypse Now, and the famous Dirty Harry one-liners delivered by Clint Eastwood, including \"Go ahead, make my day\" and \"Ask yourself one question, \'do I feel lucky?\' Well, do you, punk?\". Milius also wrote the USS Indianapolis monologue in the film Jaws; the sequence performed by Robert Shaw.  After his work on Rough Riders (1997), Milius became an instrumental force in lobbying Congress to award President Theodore Roosevelt the Medal of Honor (posthumously), for acts of conspicuous gallantry while in combat on San Juan Hill. Milius made two films featuring Roosevelt: The Wind and the Lion (where he was played by Brian Keith) and the made-for-TV film Rough Riders (where Tom Berenger took the role).\n\nThe character of John Milner from the 1973 George Lucas film American Graffiti was inspired by Milius, who was a good friend of Lucas while they were at USC film school. Likewise, the character Walter Sobchak in the 1998 film The Big Lebowski, made by his friends the Coen Brothers, was partly based on Milius. The novella \"Blind Jozef Pronek and Dead Souls\" by Aleksandar Hemon features an episode with Milius, who is described as \"sitting at a desk sucking on a cigar as long as a walking stick.\"\n\nIn 2013 a documentary about his life, titled Milius, was released.\n\nWriter Nat Segaloff called Milius:\n\n\"The best writer of the so-called USC Mafia, a tight-knit group that resuscitated—some say homogenised American cinema in the 1970s...

Milius\' stories reflect his own deeply held ethic, which embraces the values of tradition, adventure, spiritualism, honour and an intense loyalty to friends...  Although he privately chafes at his public image as a gun-toting, liberal baiting provocateur, he allows himself to be painted as such, at times even holding the brush. He plays the Hollywood game like a pro, yet sticks to his own rules; he is a romantic filmmaker who avoids love scenes; his movies contain violence, yet no death in them is without meaning.\"\n\nMilius himself once said:\n\n\"Never compromise excellence.

Franco moved from Spain to France in 1970 so that he could make more violent and sexual films, and it was at this point that his career began to go downhill commercially, as he turned to low-budget filmmaking with a heavier accent on adult-oriented films. Although he produced a few well-received, low budget horror films in the early 70\'s, many people in the industry considered him a porn director due to the huge number of X-rated adult films he began churning out.

Lucas wrote and directed THX 1138 (1971), based on his earlier student short Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB, which was a critical success but a financial failure. His next work as a writer-director was the film American Graffiti (1973), inspired by his youth in early 1960s Modesto, California, and produced through the newly founded Lucasfilm. The film was critically and commercially successful, and received five Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.\n\nLucas\'s next film, the epic space opera Star Wars (1977), had a troubled production but was a surprise hit, becoming the highest-grossing film at the time, winning six Academy Awards and sparking a cultural phenomenon. Lucas produced and co-wrote the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). With director Steven Spielberg, he created, produced and co-wrote the Indiana Jones films Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Temple of Doom (1984), The Last Crusade (1989) and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008).

Cult classics that Carpenter directed include: Dark Star (1974), Assault on Precinct 13 (1976), The Thing (1982), Christine (1983), Big Trouble in Little China (1986), Prince of Darkness (1987), They Live (1988) and In the Mouth of Madness (1995).\n\nHis films are characterized by minimalist lighting and photography, static cameras, use of steadicam, and distinctive synthesized scores. Carpenter is also notable for having composed or co-composed most of the music of his films; some of them are now considered cult as well, with the main theme of Halloween being considered a part of popular culture. His music is generally synthesized with accompaniment from piano and atmospherics. He released his first studio album Lost Themes in 2015, and also won a Saturn Award for Best Music for Vampires (1998).\n\nCarpenter is an outspoken proponent of widescreen filming, and all of his theatrical movies (with the exception of Dark Star and The Ward) were filmed anamorphic with a 2.35:1 or greater aspect ratio. The Ward was shot in Super 35, the first time Carpenter has ever used that system. Carpenter has stated he feels that the 35mm Panavision anamorphic format is \"the best movie system there is\", preferring it over both digital and 3D film. Many of Carpenter\'s films have been re-released on DVD as special editions with numerous bonus features.\n\nCarpenter has been the subject of the documentary film John Carpenter: The Man and His Movies, and American Cinematheque\'s 2002 retrospective of his films. Moreover, in 2006, the United States Library of Congress deemed Halloween to be \"culturally significant\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n\nIn 2010, writer and actor Mark Gatiss interviewed Carpenter about his career and films for his BBC documentary series A History of Horror. Carpenter appears in all three episodes of the series. He was also interviewed by Robert Rodriguez for his The Director\'s Chair series on El Rey Network.\n\nMany filmmakers have been influenced by Carpenter, including James Cameron, Quentin Tarantino (The Hateful Eight was heavily influenced by The Thing), Guillermo del Toro, Robert Rodriguez, Edgar Wright, Danny Boyle, Nicolas Winding Refn, Bong Joon-ho, among others.\n\nThe video game Dead Space 3 is said to be influenced by Carpenter\'s The Thing, The Fog and Halloween, and Carpenter has stated that he would be enthusiastic to adapt that series into a feature film.','1948-01-16',NULL),(1659,'Mikhail Red','Philippines','Mikhail Red is an independent filmmaker who was guided from a young age by his father, filmmaker Raymond Red, who is a Short Film Palme d\'Or winner.

Born in 1931, Bruno Mattei grew up in Rome, Italy, where his father owned a small film editing studio. Mattei made his debut as a director with the drama Armida, il dramma di una sposa(1970) under the alias \"Jordon B. Matthews\". He eventually had more pseudonyms than any working director in the world. He returned to editing before making another comeback in 1976 with two low-budget Nazi exploitation films, Women\'s Camp 119 (1977) (aka \"Women\'s Camp 119\") and Casa privata per le SS (1977) (aka \"SS Girls\"). Mattei followed these taboo-breaking films with excursions into porno films and mondo \"shockumentaries\", all directed under his many pseudonyms, concentrating on \"shock value\" with films such as Mondo erotico (1973), \"Libiodomania\" and \"Libidomania 2\". Always on the lookout for new exploitation avenues, Mattei followed with \"nunsploitation\", with the softcore sex film La vera storia della monaca di Monza (1980) and the violent sex thriller The Other Hell (1981). Both films involved a partnership with writer/director Claudio Fragasso, who helped him write and direct the back-to-back productions. Using yet another alias, \"Vincent Dawn\", Mattei directed Hell of the Living Dead (1980) (aka \"Hell of the Living Dead\"), a low-budged zombie picture inspired by other zombie cannibal movies such as Dawn of the Dead (1978) and Lucio Fulci\'s Zombi 2 (1979). \"Virus\" was filmed in Spain and used jungle footage from New Guinea and a patch soundtrack from Goblins \"Dawn of the Dead\" soundtrack, which was a minor hit in Italy and abroad. After directing two women\'s prison films starring Laura Gemser, Mattei moved to directing sword-and-sorcery flicks, starting with I sette magnifici gladiatori (1983). Both Mattei and Fragasso collaborated on the sci-fi/horror flick Rats - Notte di terrore (1984), inspired by the futuristic movies of the early 1980s. Mattei considers this his best work, despite his still having to work with a very low budget. He worked relentlessly through the 1980s, directing a pair of \"spaghetti westerns\", some action flicks and about half of Zombi 3 (1988) after Lucio Fulci was taken off the production, though Mattei was not credited with it. In the early 1990s Mattei directed a series of erotic thrillers and a made-for-TV movie, Cruel Jaws (1995) (TV), which was inspired by Steven Spielberg\'s Jaws (1975). Mattei continued making films, with more than 50 to his credit by the 200s. In early 2007 his health becan to decline rapidly after he was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Despite his doctor\'s warnings, he went through with a surgical operation to have the tumor removed in May of that year. After the surgery he fell into a coma from complications, and died a few days later on May 21, 2007 at age 75.','1931-07-30','2007-05-21'),(1751,'Jude Anthany Joseph',NULL,'',NULL,NULL),(1752,'Elizabeth Banks','Pittsfield, Massachusetts, USA','Elizabeth Banks (born February 10, 1974) is an American actress, producer and director.

His creative efforts are almost entirely concentrated in the area of television science fiction.\n\nA native of Pine Bluff, Arkansas, Johnson is a graduate of the Carnegie Institute of Technology. His early TV work includes The Six Million Dollar Man, The Bionic Woman and The Incredible Hulk. Johnson created the character of Jaime Sommers and the Bionic Woman series.\n\nIn 1983, he wrote and directed the original miniseries V, about an invasion of Earth by reptilian aliens. The miniseries aired on NBC, and a year later was followed by a sequel, V: The Final Battle, which Johnson briefly worked on before leaving the project due to disagreements with the network. Johnson was subsequently credited as a co-writer of the sequel miniseries under the pseudonym Lillian Weezer, and was not involved at all in the weekly V television series that followed.\n\nIn 1989, he produced the television series Alien Nation based on the 1988 film of the same name.\n\nIn 1997, he wrote and directed the movie Steel, based on the DC comic book character Steel. It featured basketball player Shaquille O\'Neal as John Henry Irons, the character\'s alter-ego.\n\nIn 2006, Johnson announced his completion of a four hour script for a new V mini series called V: The Second Generation. The storyline takes place 20 years after the original 1983 mini-series, ignoring the second mini-series (V: The Final Battle) and subsequent weekly television series. However, NBC told Johnson that they were more interested in a remake of the original V mini-series instead, which, if successful, might lead to his proposed sequel.\n\nSince then, Johnson adapted his screenplay for V: The Second Generation into a novel. It was published by Tor Books and released on February 5, 2008. However, since his discussions with NBC, Warner Bros (who hold the television rights to the V franchise) have opted to produce a remake of V (written by Scott Peters) for the ABC Network, thus ending any prospect of Johnson\'s sequel being produced for television.\n\nIn April 2008, Johnson stated his intention to remake the original V mini-series and his new sequel V: The Second Generation into feature films. Johnson claimed to have been in discussions with producers interested in the project, though was extremely vague:\n\n\"... since I own the motion picture rights to V, we’re in the process to do a remake of the original mini-series first as a theatrical feature, which I’m so jazzed about because it will give me an opportunity to really realize it and execute it in a way that was impossible to do back then. Then that will lead to the obvious sequel, because it is a franchise, and then we’ll get into The Second Generation and I\'m hoping we’ll be able to do two movies, because there’s certainly enough material in the novel to warrant two separate sequels. That’s my goal at this point and that’s what we’re in the process of doing. I just literally came from a meeting, 15–20 minutes ago with a fellow in Beverly Hills who really says that we’re gonna do it.\"\n\nHowever, since this statement, Johnson\'s potential film production has not been developed further, whilst Warner Bros\' television remake for ABC premiered on November 3, 2009.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Kenneth Johnson (producer), licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia','1942-10-26',NULL),(1822,'RZA','Brooklyn, New York, USA','Robert Fitzgerald Diggs, better known by his stage name RZA or The RZA ( /ˈrɪzə/; born July 5, 1969), is an American Grammy-winning music producer, multi-instrumentalist, author, rapper, and occasional actor, director, and screenwriter.

He was born in Rome and died in 2002 from a heart attack in Monterosi, Viterbo, near Rome at the age of 72.\n\nMargheriti started out in the Italian film industry in 1956 as a screenwriter. He started directing in 1960, his first film being \"Spacemen\" (aka \"Assignment Outer Space\"). Margheriti is known for his science fiction, horror, spaghetti western and action movies. He was the director of such cult movies as Cannibal Apocalypse, Castle of Blood, The Virgin of Nuremberg, Assignment Outer Space, Wild Wild Planet, Naked You Die, Mr. Super Invisible, The Last Hunter, Battle of the Worlds and numerous others. Most of his films were directed under the pseudonym of Anthony M. Dawson. He stopped using his real name in the USA early in his career, when he realized the English translation of the name \"Antonio Margheriti\" was \"Anthony Daisies\", and he thought it sounded too effeminate.\n\nHe was the only Italian director who worked directly for American production companies like MGM, United Artists, 20th Century Fox, Columbia Pictures, etc. with films like: Yor, the Hunter from the Future, Take a Hard Ride, Killer Fish, etc. Margheriti said his action/adventure films were his favorites, and his least favorite movies were the sword-and-sandal peplum films he made in the early 1960s (such as \"Devil of the Desert\" and \"Giants of Rome\").\n\nFor years, director Richard Morrissey disputed Margheriti\'s claim that he had directed \"Andy Warhol\'s Frankenstein\" in the early 1970s, saying that Margheriti was mostly just a technical advisor on that film. Morrissey said Margheriti did however direct a very, very brief segment of the movie (mostly the scenes involving the two children roaming around in the lab).\n\nMargheriti worked with many well-known genre actors such as Lee Van Cleef, John Saxon, Claude Rains, John Morghen, Klaus Kinski, Barbara Steele, Reb Brown, Donald Pleasence, Yul Brynner, David Warbeck, Luciano Pigozzi, Marvin Hagler, Terence Hill, Fred Williamson, Christopher Lee and many others. Most of his later films were shot in the Philippines (especially his war films). Margheriti also collaborated on the special effects in two Italian cult films which he did not direct, Sergio Leone\'s \"Fistful of Dynamite\" (1971) and Aldo Lado\'s \"The Humanoid\" (1979).\n\nMargheriti retired from filmmaking in 1996 at age 66. He died in 2002 of natural causes. Margheriti\'s son Edoardo and his daughter Antonella are both also involved in filmmaking.

He soon enrolled in the University of Washington where he pursued a degree in philosophy. Bruce began to teach gung fu in Seattle and soon opened his first school, the Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute. Two more schools followed in Oakland and Los Angeles. Concurrently Bruce married his wife, Linda and had his two children, Brandon and Shannon. In the mid sixties, Bruce was discovered while doing an exhibition at the Long Beach Internationals and a role as Kato in the tv series The Green Hornet soon followed. During this time, Bruce was also developing his own martial art, which he ultimately named Jeet Kune Do (translated: the way of the intercepting fist). Bruce\'s art was steeped in a philosophical foundation and did not follow long held martial traditions. Instead it had at its core the ideas of simplicity, directness and personal freedom. After The Green Hornet series was canceled, Bruce encountered resistance while working in Hollywood and so headed to Hong Kong to pursue a film career. In Hong Kong he made 3 films, which consecutively broke all box office records and showcased martial arts in an entirely new way. Hollywood took notice and soon Bruce was making the first Hollywood / Hong Kong coproduction with a film called Enter the Dragon. Unfortunately, Bruce Lee died in 1973 before this film was released.

He was a capable horseman and served in the Second Boer War with Montmorency\'s Scouts as a special dispatch rider.\n\nMcGowan directed and often acted in the first 33 episodes of Kalem\'s 1914 adventure film series, The Hazards of Helen, which eventually ran to 54 episodes, some still with McGowan\'s participation. While filming he began a relationship with Helen Holmes, the film\'s star, and the two married. They left Kalem to set up their own production company, Signal Films, which successfully made a series of railroad melodramas but lost out when their distributor (Mutual) failed. The collaboration ended when they divorced in 1925. There was an adopted daughter, Kaye.\n\nMcGowan successfully made the transition from silent film to talkies. While never a major star, in a busy career that spanned four decades he is credited with acting in 232 films—mostly strong roles like sheriff or villain—writing 26 screenplays and directing 242 productions. In 1932 he directed a young John Wayne in the 12-episode rail vs airplane serial The Hurricane Express for the independent Mascot Pictures.

John L. Barrett played The Lone Ranger on test broadcasts of the series in early January 1933, but when the program became part of the regular schedule Seaton was cast in the title role. In later years he claimed to have devised the cry \"Hi-yo, Silver\" because he couldn\'t whistle for his horse as the script required.\n\nSeaton joined Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as a contract writer in 1933. His first major screen credit was the Marx Brothers comedy A Day at the Races in 1937. In the early 1940s he joined 20th Century Fox, where he remained for the rest of the decade, writing scripts for Moon Over Miami, Coney Island, Charley\'s Aunt, The Song of Bernadette, and others before making his directorial debut with Diamond Horseshoe in 1945. From this point on he was credited as both screenwriter and director for most of his films, including The Shocking Miss Pilgrim, Miracle on 34th Street, Apartment for Peggy, Chicken Every Sunday, The Big Lift, For Heaven\'s Sake, Little Boy Lost, The Country Girl, and The Proud and Profane.\n\nBut Not Goodbye, Seaton\'s 1944 Broadway debut as a playwright, closed after only 23 performances, although it later was adapted for the 1946 film The Cockeyed Miracle by Karen DeWolf.

Wise\'s working period spanned the 1930s to the 1990s.\n\nOften contrasted with contemporary \"auteur\" directors such as Stanley Kubrick who tended to bring a distinctive directorial \"look\" to a particular genre, Wise is famously viewed to have allowed his (sometimes studio assigned) story to dictate style. Later critics such as Martin Scorsese would go on to expand that characterization, insisting that despite Wise\'s notorious workaday concentration on stylistic perfection within the confines of genre and budget, his choice of subject matter and approach still functioned to identify Wise as an artist and not merely an artisan. Through whatever means, Wise\'s approach would bring him critical success as a director in many different traditional film genres: from horror to noir to Western to war films to science fiction, to musical and drama, with many repeat hits within each genre. Wise\'s tendency towards professionalism led to a degree of preparedness which, though nominally motivated by studio budget constraints, nevertheless advanced the moviemaking art, with many Academy Award-winning films the result.

These films featured a rotating \"stock company\" of actors mostly made up of Playboy Playmates and Penthouse \"Pets\", including Julie Strain, Dona Speir, Hope Marie Carlton, Cynthia Brimhall, Roberta Vasquez, Julie K. Smith, Shae Marks, and Wendy Hamilton. Several of his films were done wholly or largely in Shreveport using many local actors or actors with local ties.\n\nBefore the B-movies, Sidaris was a pioneer in sports television. He directed coverage of hundreds of football and basketball games, Olympic events, and special programs and won seven Emmy awards for his work in the field. His best known work was with ABC\'s Wide World of Sports; he was the show\'s first director, and continued in that post for 25 years.\n\nSidaris pioneered what he called the \"honey shot\", close-ups of cheerleaders and pretty girls in the stands at sporting events. He won an Emmy Award in 1969 for directing the Summer Olympics. He expanded into dramatic television in the 1970s, directing episodes of programs like Gemini Man (1976), CBS\'s Kojak (mid-1970s), ABC\'s The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries (late-1970s) and ABC\'s Monday Night Football.\n\nHe expanded into film, specializing in action flicks featuring buxom gun-toting Playboy Playmates and Penthouse Pets with titles like Fit to Kill and Savage Beach. Most of Sidaris\' \"Triple B\" series (later given the title L.E.T.H.A.L. Ladies) focused on the adventures of a team of secret agents and were mostly filmed in Hawaii. Several entries in the series were merely produced by him and were written and directed by others. Although the series featured recurring characters, continuity between films was not a priority and it was common for an actress who played a villain (and was killed off) in one film to re-appear in a subsequent film as a hero.\n\nWith his wife, Arlene T.

After his beginnings as a struggling actor for a number of years upon arriving to New York City in 1969 and later Hollywood in 1974, he won his first critical acclaim as an actor for his co-starring role as Stanley Rosiello in The Lords of Flatbush.\n\nHe subsequently found gradual work as an extra or side character in films with a sizable budget until he achieved his greatest critical and commercial success as an actor and screenwriter, starting in 1976 with his role as boxer Rocky Balboa, in the first film of the successful Rocky series (1976–present), for which he also wrote the screenplays. In the films, Rocky is portrayed as an underdog boxer who fights numerous brutal opponents, and wins the world heavyweight championship twice.\n\nIn 1977, he was the third actor in cinema to be nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor. His film Rocky was inducted into the National Film Registry, and had its props placed in the Smithsonian Museum. His use of the front entrance to the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the Rocky series led the area to be nicknamed the Rocky Steps. Philadelphia has a statue of his Rocky placed permanently near the museum, and he was voted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.\n\nUp until 1982, his films were not big box office successes unless they were Rocky sequels, and none received the critical acclaim achieved with the first Rocky. This changed with the successful action film First Blood in which he portrayed the PTSD-plagued soldier John Rambo. Originally an adaptation of the eponymous novel by David Morell, First Blood’s script was significantly altered by Stallone during the film’s production. He would play the role in a total of five Rambo films (1982–2019). From the mid-1980s through to the late 1990s, he would go on to become one of Hollywood\'s highest-paid actors of that era by appearing in a slew of commercially successful action films which were however generally panned by critics. These include Cobra, Tango and Cash, Cliffhanger, the better received Demolition Man, and The Specialist.\n\nHe declined in popularity in the early 2000s but rebounded back to prominence in 2006 with a sixth installment in the Rocky series and 2008 with a fourth in the Rambo series. In the 2010s, he launched The Expendables films series (2010–2014), in which he played the lead as the mercenary Barney Ross. In 2013, he starred in the successful Escape Plan, and acted in its sequels. In 2015, he returned to the Rocky series with Creed, that serve as spin-off films focusing on Adonis \"Donnie\" Creed played by Michael B. Jordan, the son of the ill-fated boxer Apollo Creed, to whom the long-retired Rocky is a mentor. Reprising the role brought him praise, and his first Golden Globe award for the first Creed, as well as a third Oscar nomination, having been first nominated for the same role 40 years prior.','1946-07-06',NULL),(2226,'Jonathan Glendening',NULL,'',NULL,NULL),(2227,'Liz Adams',NULL,'',NULL,NULL),(2228,'Ilya Naishuller','Moscow, RSFSR, USSR [now Russia]','Ilya Viktorovich Naishuller (born November 19, 1983) is a Russian film director and musician.

He called for a greater political significance and more progressive story telling. Bergman being the leading figure of Swedish cinema, was not his ideal at all, although he recognized his position: \"Nor me or my friends saw very much in him. We didn\'t find the issue of god\'s existence that damn important.

His first full-length feature, The First Teacher (1964), was favourably received in the Soviet Union and screened by numerous film festivals abroad. His second film, Asya Klyachina\'s Story (1967), was suppressed by Soviet authorities. When issued twenty years later, it was acclaimed as his masterpiece. Thereupon, Konchalovsky filmed adaptations of Ivan Turgenev\'s A Nest of Gentle Folk (1969) and Chekhov\'s Uncle Vanya (1970), with Innokenty Smoktunovsky in the title role. His epic Siberiade upon its 1979 release was favourably received at Cannes and made possible his move to the United States in 1980.\n\nHis most popular Hollywood releases are Maria\'s Lovers (1984), Runaway Train (1985), based on a script by Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, and Tango & Cash (1989), starring Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell.

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in the history of cinema. Kurosawa displayed a bold, dynamic style, strongly influenced by Western cinema yet distinct from it; he was involved with all aspects of film production.\n\nKurosawa entered the Japanese film industry in 1936, following a brief stint as a painter. After years of working on numerous films as an assistant director and scriptwriter, he made his debut as a director during World War II with the popular action film Sanshiro Sugata (1943). After the war, the critically acclaimed Drunken Angel (1948), in which Kurosawa cast the then little-known actor Toshiro Mifune in a starring role, cemented the director\'s reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan. The two men would go on to collaborate on another fifteen films.\n\nRashomon (1950), which premiered in Tokyo, became the surprise winner of the Golden Lion at the 1951 Venice Film Festival. The commercial and critical success of that film opened up Western film markets for the first time to the products of the Japanese film industry, which in turn led to international recognition for other Japanese filmmakers. Kurosawa directed approximately one film per year throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, including a number of highly regarded (and often adapted) films, such as Ikiru (1952), Seven Samurai (1954), Throne of Blood (1957), Yojimbo (1961) and High and Low (1963). After the 1960s he became much less prolific; even so, his later work—including two of his final films, Kagemusha (1980) and Ran (1985)—continued to receive great acclaim.\n\nIn 1990, he accepted the Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement. Posthumously, he was named \"Asian of the Century\" in the \"Arts, Literature, and Culture\" category by AsianWeek magazine and CNN, cited there as being among the five people who most prominently contributed to the improvement of Asia in the 20th century. His career has been honored by many retrospectives, critical studies and biographies in both print and video, and by releases in many consumer media.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Akira Kurosawa , licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.','1910-03-23','1998-09-06'),(2437,'Ruggero Deodato','Potenza, Basilicata, Italy','Ruggero Deodato (7 May 1939 - 29 December 2022) was an Italian film director.

He was an assistant to director D.W. Griffith on The Birth of a Nation and Intolerance. By the time he was 23 Beaudine had directed his first picture, a short called Almost a King (1915). He would continue to direct shorts exclusively until 1922, when he shifted his efforts into making feature-length films.\n\nBeaudine directed silent films for Goldwyn Pictures (before it became part of MGM), Metro Pictures (also before MGM), First National Pictures, Principal and Warner Brothers. In 1926 he made Sparrows, the story of orphans imprisoned in a swamp farm starring Mary Pickford. Beaudine had at least 30 pictures to his credit before the sound era began. Among his first sound films were short Mack Sennett comedies; he made at least one film for Sennett while contractually bound elsewhere, resulting in his adopting the pseudonym \"William Crowley.\" He would occasionally use the pseudonym in later years, usually as \"William X. Crowley.\"\n\nHe ground out several movies annually for Fox Films, Warner Brothers, Paramount, and Universal Pictures. His most famous credit of the early 1930s is The Old-Fashioned Way, a comedy about old-time show folks starring W. C. Fields.\n\nBeaudine was one of a number of experienced directors (including Raoul Walsh and Allan Dwan) who were brought to England from Hollywood in the 1930s to work on what were in all other respects very British productions. Beaudine directed four films there starring Will Hay, including Boys Will Be Boys (1935) and Where There\'s a Will (1936).\n\nBeaudine was often entrusted with series films, including the Torchy Blane, The East Side Kids, Jiggs and Maggie, The Shadow, Charlie Chan and The Bowery Boys series. His efficiency was so well known that Walt Disney hired him to direct some of his television projects of the 1950s and had him direct a feature western, Ten Who Dared (1960).

In a span of seven years, from 1972 to 1978, he directed nine feature films in such genres as horror and action. Girdler also wrote and produced three of his features, Abby, Sheba, Baby and The Manitou.\n\nGirdler, born in Louisville, Kentucky started Studio One Productions in his early twenties, and directed his first feature a low-budget film entitled Asylum of Satan which was briefly released to theaters. Girdler\'s second effort was a gory, if overlong slasher thriller entitled Three on a Meathook. Both Asylum of Satan and Three on a Meathook were filmed in his home town, and although both films received little notice, the films got the attention of Samuel Z. Arkoff and American International Pictures (AIP).\n\nGirdler next directed three \"blaxploitation\" films. The first, in 1973, was a long lost thriller titled The Zebra Killer starring Austin Stoker. By coincidence, another Louisville native, Rich Miles, appeared in this picture in a small role as the local cop who discovers some of the bodies. Girdler\'s next feature was an Exorcist clone titled Abby with Carol Speed in the lead role and co-starring William H. Marshall (from Blacula) and Oscar nominee Juanita Moore. Abby became Girdler\'s breakthrough film. The picture opened in 1974 to major box office success, earning nearly $9 million. Warner Brothers thought Abby was too derivative of Exorcist and the film was suddenly pulled from theaters after two weeks. The last \"blaxploitation\" film Girdler directed was the Pam Grier vehicle Sheba, Baby and his first effort in the action genre. Sheba, Baby was another major hit in theaters, even though it is often cited as one of Pam Grier\'s more weaker vehicles than her other similar themed action films Coffy and Foxy Brown. Girdler was then finished with his contract with Arkoff and AIP.\n\nGirdler\'s sixth feature was another action themed film starring Leslie Nielsen, in one of his more serious roles as an agent tracked by the government in the political thriller Project: Kill, which was given a limited theatrical release.\n\nGrizzly, released in 1976, was Girdler\'s most financially successful film. A Jaws clone from start to finish, the film was about an oversized grizzly bear terrorizing a National Park. The movie starred Christopher George, Andrew Prine and Richard Jaeckel and went on to become one of the most successful motion pictures of the year, earning an impressive $39 million worldwide. After this triumph, Grizzly\'s producer and distributor, Edward L. Montoro and Film Ventures International decided to keep the financial profits. Girdler (and the film\'s screenwriters/producers Harvey Flaxman and David Sheldon, who also worked with Girdler on previous films) sued Montoro and Film Ventures to have the profits returned. Girdler directed The Day of the Animals, another effort for Montoro which is sometimes cited as a sequel to Grizzly. The film had an all-star cast including Christopher George, Leslie Nielsen, Richard Jaeckel, Ruth Roman and Lynda Day George. It was Girdler\'s second approach to nature-versus-man films, but was not as successful as Grizzly.\n\nThe Manitou was the last film directed by Girdler. Based on a best selling novel by Graham Masterton, and starring Tony Curtis and Susan Strasberg, The Manitou was perhaps Girdler\'s most expensive production. It was acquired by AVCO Embassy Pictures and released in 1978 and was also a major hit in theaters. He was killed in a helicopter crash in Manila, Philippines on January 21, 1978, while scouting locations for his tenth film project.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article William Girdler, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.','1947-10-22','1978-01-21'),(3202,'April Mullen','Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada','April Mullen is a Canadian film and television actress, director and producer.

In 2012, he received a master\'s degree in the Physics and Technology of Nanostructures.

Inspired by films such as \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly,\" \"Evil Dead 2,\" \"Oldboy,\" and \"Kill Bill\", Sokolov discovered that he had both a love and a talent for dark comedy, a genre which has yet to gain popularity in Russia.

Niblo was born Frederick Liedtke (several sources give \"Frederico Nobile\", apparently erroneously) in York, Nebraska, to a French mother and a father who had served as a captain in the American Civil War and was wounded at the Battle of Gettysburg. Using the stage name, Fred Niblo, Liedtke began his show business career performing in vaudeville and in live theater. After more than twenty years doing live performing as a monologist, during which he traveled extensively around the globe, he worked in Australia from 1912 through 1915, where he turned to the burgeoning motion picture industry and made his first two films.\n\nAs a Hollywood director, he is most remembered for several notable films beginning with his 1920 work The Mark of Zorro which starred Douglas Fairbanks. The following year he teamed up with Fairbanks again in The Three Musketeers and then directed Rudolph Valentino in Blood and Sand.\n\nIn 1924, Niblo directed the film Thy Name Is Woman. In 1925, Niblo was the principal director of the epic Ben-Hur that was one of the most expensive films of the day but became the third highest-grossing silent film in cinema history. Niblo followed up on this success with two major 1926 works, The Temptress starring Greta Garbo in her second film in America, and Norma Talmadge in Camille. Niblo went on to direct some of the greatest stars of the era including Joan Crawford, Lillian Gish, and Ronald Colman. In 1930 he directed his first talkie with two of the biggest names in show business, John Gilbert and Renée Adorée in a film titled Redemption.\n\nFred Niblo retired in 1933 after more than forty years in show business. The last sixteen years were used to make more than forty films, most of which were feature length projects. He was an important personality in the early years of Hollywood and was one of the original founders of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In recognition of his role in the development of the film industry, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7014 Hollywood Boulevard on February 8, 1960. His Ben-Hur film has been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\n\nFred Niblo died in New Orleans, Louisiana, and is interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery near his wife Enid Bennett in Glendale, California.

Jackie Chan has been acting since the 1970s and has appeared in over 100 films.\n\nChan has received stars on the Hong Kong Avenue of Stars and the Hollywood Walk of Fame. As a cultural icon, Chan has been referenced in various pop songs, cartoons, and video games. Chan is also a Cantopop and Mandopop star, having released a number of albums and sung many of the theme songs for the films in which he has starred.\n\nChan was born on April 7, 1954, in Victoria Peak, in the former Crown colony of Hong Kong, as Chan Kong-sang (meaning \"born in Hong Kong\") to Charles and Lee-Lee Chan, refugees from the Chinese Civil War. He was nicknamed Paopao (Chinese: 炮炮, literally meaning \"Cannonball\") because he was such a big baby, weighing 12 pounds, or about 5.4 kgs. Since his parents worked for the French Consul to Hong Kong, Chan spent his formative years within the grounds of the consul\'s residence in the Victoria Peak district. Chan attended the Nah-Hwa Primary School on Hong Kong Island, where he failed his first year, after which his parents withdrew him from the school.\n\nIn 1960, his father immigrated to Canberra, Australia, to work as the head cook for the American embassy, and Chan was sent to the China Drama Academy, a Peking Opera School run by Master Yu Jim-yuen. Chan trained rigorously for the next decade, excelling in martial arts and acrobatics. He eventually became part of the Seven Little Fortunes, a performance group made up of the school\'s best students, gaining the stage name Yuen Lo in homage to his master. Chan became close friends with fellow group members Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, the three of them later to be known as the Three Brothers or Three Dragons. At the age of 17, he worked as a stuntman in the Bruce Lee films Fist of Fury and Enter the Dragon under the stage name Chan Yuen Lung. He received his first starring role later that year, in Little Tiger of Canton, which had a limited release in Hong Kong in 1973.','1954-04-07',NULL),(3421,'Yusry Abdul Halim','Selangor, Malaysia','Datuk Yusry bin Abdul Halim (born 15 June 1973) is a Malaysian singer, actor and film director.

(Photo Chemical Laboratories, a film company later incorporated into Toho Studios). He studied under director Satsuo Yamamoto, as did Akira Kurosawa, Ishirō Honda, and Senkichi Taniguchi. When the latter two trainees were drafted into Japan\'s war in China, Oda found his career accelerated. He was promoted to director in 1940 with Song of Kunya, after a relatively scant few years of training. Perhaps because of this relative lack of training, and certainly because Oda was not drafted into the army, P.C.L. and Toho kept Oda going as a maker of programmers - trivial pictures that had to be made in order to keep product flowing into the theaters, but which offered little time or room for artistic achievement.\n\nProbably his most distinguished credits are Lady From Hell (1949, based on a Kurosawa script), Tomei Ningen a 1954 Japanese horror classic inspired by The Invisible Man, a follow-up to his earlier 1954 film Ghost Man. The only film he made ever to be shown outside Japan was the second Godzilla film, Godzilla Raids Again (1955), released in the United States as Gigantis, the Fire Monster. Toho insisted that Oda direct as many as seven movies a year, knowing that he could be trusted to deliver them on time. Over his entire career, Motoyoshi Oda directed fifty movies, not to mention his work as assistant director and second-unit direction on Ishiro Honda\'s Eagle of the Pacific (1953).

He made 17 films as a director and about 50 scripts from 1964 to 1985.\n\nFernando Di Leo was born on 11 January 1932 in San Ferdinando di Puglia. After briefly working in Rome\'s film school Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia, di Leo made his debut as a director as part of the omnibus comedy Gli eroi di ieri, oggi, domani with his episode titled Un posto in paradiso (transl. A Place in Heaven). Following this Di Leo wrote several scripts for Westerns, often uncredited. This included work on A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More. Some of his Westerns had uncredited literary sources, such as Days of Vengeance which is loosely based on Alexandre Dumas\' The Count of Monte Cristo.\n\nDi Leo was a fan of film noir and wanted to make an Italian version of these films. Among his first efforts was the script for Mino Guerrini\'s Date for a Murder based on Franco Enna\'s novel Tempo di massacro written in 1955. In Di Leo\'s version, the setting is moved to a contemporary Rome and has elements of contemporary spy films. Di Leo worked with Guerrini again on the film Gangsters \'70 which did not do well at the box office. Di Leo began directing more of his own films at the time including the war film Red Roses for the Fuhrer and a few erotic films: A Woman on Fire, A Wrong Way to Love and Seduction. From 1969 to 1976, di Leo was able to produce many of his own works with his production company Duania cineproduzioni 70. He followed this with a return to noir with Naked Violence, a film adapting a novel by Giorgio Scerbanenco, a writer who Di Leo would adapt for several future film productions.\n\nDi Leo would make a giallo film with Slaughter Hotel starring Klaus Kinski and Margaret Lee. Following this Di Leo worked on Caliber 9 and The Italian Connection which were both inspired by the writing of Scerbanenco. He followed up this film Il Boss, a film which got Di Leo in trouble with politicians and authorities due to the film\'s display of connections between the mafia and Italy\'s major party Democrazia Cristiana. Di Leo followed this up with Shoot First, Die Later in 1974. Di Leo worked through the latter half of the 1970s directing Mister Scarface, Kidnap Syndicate, and Nick the Sting. He also wrote scripts for other directors such as Romolo Guerrieri\'s Young, Violent, Dangerous, and Ruggero Deodato\'s Live Like a Cop, Die Like a Man. Di Leo\'s last film produced by his company Duania cineproduzioni 70 was Rulers of the City in 1976. He continued with a few more films after with the film noir Blood and Diamonds, the erotic drama To Be Twenty - both in 1978, and Madness in 1980.\n\nDi Leo worked in television in the 1980s, starting with the television series L\'assassino ha le ore contate, which involved six one-hour-long made-for-TV films produced by RAI Uno which as of 2013 are unreleased.

His 1929 film A Living Puppet (Ikeru ningyo) was selected as the fourth best film of the year by the film journal, Kinema Junpo. Many of his 1930s films featured the actor Isamu Kosugi. One such work, Policeman (Keisatsukan), has been called \"a tremendously stylish gangster movie about the love-hate relationship between a cop and a criminal, once childhood friends\" It is Uchida’s only surviving complete silent film. Uchida borrows from Hollywood gangster films and expressionist techniques in a story of a young policeman tracking down an old friend who is now a criminal. His work from the 1920 and 1930s possess a leftist social commentary and were often some of the most critically acclaimed films of the time. Kinema Junpo selected Jinsei Gekijo as the number two film of 1936, Karininaki Zenshin as the best film of 1937, and Tsuchi as the best film of 1939. The latter was praised for its realistic depiction of the lives of poor Meiji-period tenant farmers. Unfortunately, few of Uchida\'s prewar works survive in their entirety.\n\nIn 1941, Uchida quit the Nikkatsu studio, and after failing to start his own production company, in 1943 began to work with the Manchukuo Film Association, although he never completed a film there. In 1945 he was taken prisoner and held in Manchuria until 1954, when he returned to Japan.\n\nUpon he return, he joined the Toei studio.

Born Rollo Smolt Thorpe in Hutchinson, Kansas, he began his entertainment career performing in vaudeville and onstage. In 1921 he began in motion pictures as an actor and directed his first silent film in 1923. He went on to direct more than one hundred and eighty films. The first full length motion picture he directed for MGM was Last of the Pagans (1935) starring Ray Mala. After directing The Last Challenge in 1967, he retired from the film industry. He died in Palm Springs, California in 1991.\n\nThorpe is also known as the original director of The Wizard of Oz. He was fired after two weeks of shooting, because it was felt that his scenes did not have the right air of fantasy about them. Thorpe notoriously gave Judy Garland a blonde wig and cutesy \"baby-doll\" makeup that made her look like a girl in her late teens rather than an innocent Kansas farm girl of about thirteen. Both makeup and wig were discarded at the suggestion of George Cukor, who was brought in temporarily. Stills from Thorpe\'s work on the film survive today.\n\nFor his contribution to the motion picture industry, Thorpe has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6101 Hollywood Blvd.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia','1896-02-24','1991-05-01'),(3967,'J.R.

Very much an anti-hero, Mitchell often ignores the orders of his superiors and demonstrates disdain for by-the-book development work as well as normal social graces.','The movie opens with title and credits and the Mitchell theme over stills of Mitchell (we will see this was the death of one of the Dune Buggy drivers later in the movie). It is late evening at the Walter Deaney lavish residence. No one is home and a burglar (John Ashby) breaks in through the French door to the study. Enroute home in his limo is Walter Deaney (John Saxon) and friends: two hookers and a public official are heading back to the house to continue the party. The burglar steals some silverware and looks over the gun case as the limo pulls onto the long driveway to the house. The blonde, Helena Jackman (Vicky Peters) and brunette, Prudence Lang (Carole Estes) hookers are left in the living room while Deaney and Don Townsend (Bill Sullivan) go to get something in another room. Deaney spots a light and hears the burglar in the study. Rather than call the police as Don suggests, he decides to take matters into his own hands. He sets a trap and gets a gun from a hallway drawer. When the burglar comes into the hallway to investigate, Deaney shoots him in the chest, killing him.\n\nA patrol car, carrying Mitchell (Joe Don Baker) in the backseat, responds to a police call at the Deaney residence. When they arrive, a private security patrol walks over to greet them. Mitchell joins the two patrolmen in the investigation. Deaney explains to the patrolman what happened. We see a firearm next to the body of the burglar. Mitchell picks up the hand gun with a pencil and places it in a plastic evidence bag. He asks Deaney if all the guns in the case are loaded. He pulls one from high in the case and check it and notices that Don and the two hookers are leaving. Mitchell activates the gate and closes it before the car can leave the property. He trots out to the limo while Deaney makes a phone call. The crime lab has arrived and tapes off the body and photographs the scene. Mitchell resumes his examination of the gun case contents.\n\nIt is Christmas time and Police Chief Albert Pallin (Robert Phillips) enters the station. Mitchell is waiting for him in his office. The two men don\'t like each other. Mitchell has refused to sign the report on the death at the Deaney residence. Mitchell suspects Deaney is lying and that the death of the burglar was murder. Pallin warns Mitchell not to bother Deaney and to see Det. Aldridge (Buck Young) for his next assignment. Mitchell must watch one James Arthur Cummings (Martin Balsam) on a 24-hour surveillance. Det. Tyzack (Rayford Barnes) takes Mitchell to the Cummings residence and briefs him. He tells Mitchell that Cummings specializes in the import of stolen merchandise, and this week it is Heroin from Mexico: a full kilo. Mitchell vows to get both Deaney and Cummings, but Tyzack disagrees, \"No way, you don\'t get neither.\" Mitchell gets in his car and waits for Cummings to come home. He doesn\'t have long to wait. Benton (Merlin Olsen) is Cummings\' bodyguard and driver and pulls up and opens the car door for his boss. Mitchell trots up the driveway and introduces himself. Cummings dismisses the cop telling him, \"Benefit\'s not due until January, son. Make an appointment, son, and have your chief give me a ring.\" Benton tartly adds, \"No salesmen at this entrance.\" Mitchell walks back to his car to begin a long day. He lights up a cigarette. He empties out the ashtray as Benton watches from the house. Cummings approaches the driver\'s open window and asks, \"All right. Now what do you want?\" Mitchell asks about Mistretta and the Heroin shipment from Mexico. Cummings denies any knowledge and warns Mitchell about falling rocks. At midnight Mitchell drives to the Deaney home and Cummings calls Mistretta. A short time later Salvatore Mistretta (Morgan Paull) picks Cummings up at his home. They drive and talk. Cummings wants the dope shipped somewhere else. Mr. Gallano apparently approved of both the shipment and using Cummings\' facilities without informing Cummings. Mitchell calls in to report he is at the Deaney residence and he is going inside unarmed. He makes entry the same as the burglar and notes he couldn\'t reach the handguns, if like the burglar, he was only 5\'4\" tall. Deaney is home and catches sight of the detective. A car headlight reveals Deaney and Mitchell runs back to his car. Mitchell returns to headquarters and he and Tyzack are going through the file room. Chief Pallin enters the room and orders Tyzack out. Pallin explains the Feds have been investigating Deaney and his trade union activities, so leave him alone. Mitchell returns home and is reviewing the Cummings file when someone comes to the door. It is Greta (Linda Evans), a very high priced hooker. She introduces herself as Mitchell\'s \"new friend\". He invites her in and offers her a drink. He manages to spill a beer on her legs. She explains that she is a Christmas present, but she won\'t tell Mitchell who is paying. Mitchell empties her purse and finds nothing but her ID. She leaves.\n\nThe next day, Mitchell follows Cummings to the park. Cummings meets with Tony Gallano (Harold J. Stone) and again makes it clear he will not participate in the Heroin shipment. The short meeting ends and Mitchell follows Cummings car. Cummings stops and gets out to talk to Mitchell. He makes it clear he does not want to be bothered by the policeman. Assuming Mitchell would say no, Cummings and Benton arrange for a reception on a dirt road. An orange Mustang, driven by Benton\'s friend (Alan Gibbs) runs Mitchell off the road destroying Mitchell\'s car. Mitchell does manage to get the license number. He intends to deal with this person on his own terms.\n\nCummings calls his friend Rudy Moran (Sidney Clute) in Las Vegas. He explains the situation, hoping for a little assistance, but Rudy tells Cummings, \"What the hell are you calling me for? If Gallano\'s involved, I don\'t want any part of it.\" Mitchell picks up a new car and sees Cummings parked near the station. He drives up and parks next to a yellow Plymouth with three men inside. Mitchell gets out and walks over to the deli where Cummings is buying some food. He steps on Benton\'s foot on the way. As Cummings gets back into his car, the yellow Plymouth drives by and snaps the back door off the Lincoln. Mitchell walks back to his car and gets a call on the details about the Mustang driver. Mitchell drives over to the address and waits. He spots the driver pulling the battered orange car into the garage. Mitchell pulls up and gets out of his car. Before the man can retrieve a weapon from the passenger\'s side of the Mustang, Mitchell grabs him, hits him twice, and then kicks the door shut on the guy\'s hand. The man screams in pain, and Mitchell tells him, \"Shut up, you\'ll wake up the neighbors.\" He takes the man\'s gun and leaves.\n\nMitchell is at his desk at the station reviewing pictures of the Cummings case. Aldridge demands Mitchell bring in at least one man tailing Cummings. Cummings is out playing golf, Benton is acting as caddy. Mitchell watches from his car. A man from the yellow Plymouth gets out and approaches Cummings. Mitchell gets out of his car to observe. He talks to the man and is brushed off. Edmondo Bocca (Duffy Hambleton) runs towards Cummings, so Mitchell shoots him in the leg. He disarms the bleeding hood and hands the man\'s gun to Cummings. He tells Cummings, \"I\'ve got to go call headquarters.\" The two men in the yellow Plymouth observe the scene and then drive off. Aldridge confronts Mitchell outside the police station. Mitchell reminds Aldridge he wanted the man for two weeks and no bail and got it.\n\nMitchell joins Cummings at his home for dinner. Benton acts as cook and butler. Cummings tries to impart some advice, but Mitchell asks about the Heroin. Cummings does volunteer that Bocca works for Mistretta. Cummings and Brenton get into an argument over the cold coffee. Mitchell drives home and gets beaten up by the two men in the Plymouth working for Mistretta. A night with Greta helps. Mitchell again asks Greta who is paying her and she refuses to answer. Mitchell tells her that he just wants to know who is paying her. She responds, \"So why does that bother you, you\'re not paying for it...You couldn\'t afford me...$1,000 a night.\" Greta makes coffee and Mitchell again goes through her purse. He finds marijuana and he arrests her after she accuses him of being a crooked cop. He hands over the bag of grass to the Desk Sergeant (Jerry Hardin) and waits for her booking. Mitchell tells Greta, \"It\'s only a $500 fine. At a $1000 per night, you\'re still ahead.\" \"Oh, you\'re a mean bastard, Mitchell,\" she tartly replies. \"I had a clean record in this town.\" Mitchell proudly confirms for the Desk Sergeant that he enjoyed her company, and then leaves the building.\n\nThe next day, Mitchell is still on surveillance. Greta is parked behind him. Cummings tells Benton to invite Mitchell into the house. Cummings comes to the point, \"I want to put you on the payroll.\" He concedes he needs help, \"I want to buy your services.\" While Mitchell takes notes of the bribe, Greta bangs into Mitchell\'s car. She writes \"Bastard\" on the windshield with her lipstick. Cummings continues, \"It could be open, cash, or subtle just like you take it from other people.\" On the subject of the hooker, Cummings notes, \"She\'s too expensive, you can\'t afford her on a policeman\'s salary. Now someone\'s picking up the check, who could that be?\" Mitchell tells Cummings it is him, but Cummings corrects the detective, \"No, I don\'t. I don\'t pay for your whores, Mitchell.\" Mitchell asks, \"Then who is?\" Cummings laughs and responds, \"You mean you don\'t know? You\'re a cop, and you don\'t know?\" Mitchell storms out of the house and drives over to see Deaney. \"I knew you\'d call sooner or later,\" Deaney tells Mitchell. Deaney admits he admires Mitchell and adds, \"How\'s the broad?\" He offers to set up a company and transfer property with a $75,000 profit for Mitchell. Mitchell responds, \"I\'m gonna bust you for the murder of the Mexican, or die trying.\" Deaney warns Mitchell that that would be a big mistake.\n\nAt the Indian Dunes Motor Recreation Park, Mitchell follows Cummings into the lot. Deaney is driving a Dune Buggy and talks to Cummings and suggest murder as a solution to their mutual problem. The limo departs and Mitchell follows. Cummings gets out of his car and sits in Mitchell\'s car. He offers Mitchell Walter Deaney, but Mitchell counteroffers that he will get Cummings first, and then he\'ll get Deaney on his own. Benton pulls a gun and takes Mitchell\'s gun. Cummings and Benton drive off. Cummings explains to Benton that if Deaney kills Mitchell, then Cummings will have more cops protecting him from Mistretta. They drive to the track and Mitchell gets stuck in the mud. He gets out and is soon menaced by Deaney in one of two Dune Buggies. They toy with Mitchell, who is on foot. Mitchell grabs a rock and kills one driver who got stuck. Mitchell gets in the Dune Buggy and goes after Deaney in the other. Deaney manages to flip his vehicle and it bursts into flames. Mitchell gets out and stares at the burning wreckage. He lights a cigarette and watches.\n\nMitchell heads home for the night. The next day he is driving back to the Cummings residence. A radio broadcast announces the death of Walter Deaney. Mitchell honks the horn and Cummings comes to the window. A little boy (Todd Bass) approaches the car on a skateboard. He annoys Mitchell to the point where Mitchell tells the kid to piss off and go to hell. Cummings confronts Mitchell at his car and asks Mitchell why he hasn\'t been arrested. Mitchell tells Cummings he wants the whole crew, Mistretta, Gallano, and the Heroin. Cummings invites him in to the house and tells him what happened with the shipment. He offers to set up everything and hand it over to Mitchell, but he only gets the Heroin and Mistretta. Cummings emphasizes that he is not part of the deal. Mitchell agrees and acts as chauffeur and drives to the docks in Long Beach. The Kef Falcon has unloaded and a customs officer (Rob Narke) wheels a steamer trunk out to the waiting car. The Rich Old Lady (Lillian McBride) signs for it. Mitchell loads the case into the trunk of the car and drives off. They are observed by Benton who calls Cummings from a phone booth. Cummings then calls Mistretta and tells him about Mitchell and the consignment. He plans to take his boat out and knows Mistretta will kill Mitchell. He thinks he\'s solved his problems. Cummings makes one final call to the police. He reports that Mitchell will be going to see Mistretta and might need some help. Mitchell stops the Cadillac and checks for the heroin in the trunk. He tells the old lady that it is just chalk and she should just walk away from the whole mess. He concludes that Cummings is double-crossing Mistretta and Gallano. Before he drives off, Mitchell stuffs a rag into the gas filler tube on the car. He prepares the car as a bomb if need be. He then drives up to Calabasas and his rendezvous with Mistretta.\n\nCummings and Benton get on the boat and pull out to sea. They are heading to Mexico. Mitchell drives to Mistretta\'s home. Mistretta and his henchman greet Mitchell. Mitchell feigns surprise at the double-cross. Mistretta reveals that he is going to kill Mitchell and put him on Cummings\' boat. Mitchell manages to blow up the car and escape Mistretta and his men, at least initially. A police helicopter provides Mitchell a gun and he kills Mistretta and his three men. The helicopter pilot (Charles A. Tamburro) and the officer (Gary Combs) fly Mitchell to Marina del Rey and land so Mitchell can talk to the Harbor Master. They depart and head south for Mexico looking for the Cummings boat.\n\nThe officer explains they have a fuel issue and if the boat crosses into Mexican waters they cannot arrest them. Mitchell asks about the large yellow tank they are carrying. The officer ties the rope to the tank and winch. Mitchell intends to use the tank as a battering ram on the boat. It works and Mitchell is able to distract Benton and Cummings long enough to drop down on to the boat. Mitchell manages to dispatch Benton with a boat hook. He tosses Benton\'s body overboard. He disables the engine. Cummings tries to make a final plea to Mitchell with a half-million dollar bribe. In a scene right out of Key Largo, Cummings feigns disarming himself and surrendering, but Mitchell is in no mood for an arrest. When Cummings turns to face him, armed of course, Mitchell drops him to the deck with a rifle bullet to the forehead.\n\nThat night, a dead tired Mitchell goes home. He thinks his place has been burglarized and enters with his gun drawn. Greta is in his bed sleeping. He pulls her out and searches the apartment. They are alone. He asks how she got in. She shows him a key. Mitchell is horrified by the mess in the kitchen. He asks her to leave. He takes a shower while Greta cleans up the kitchen. He goes to bed, and Greta asks to join him. He sarcastically chides her, \"What for? Nobody paying you this time.\" He smells marihuana, \"That\'s grass.\" He finds a roach in the kitchen trashcan and grabs her and tells her to get her coat. He intends to arrest her again. We close with a freeze frame of Mitchell dragging Greta out of bed. Closing credits roll with the Mitchell theme playing.',1393,0,'US',0),(2,'#Alive','2020-06-24',98,0,'As a grisly virus rampages a city, a lone man stays locked inside his apartment, digitally cut off from seeking help and desperate to find a way out.','Oh Joon-woo (Yoo Ah-in) awakens and discovers he is alone at home. His parents left that morning in a hurry leaving him money for groceries. Oh Joon-woo is a gamer and is online with some of his gaming friends when he first hears about the strange disease that causes infected people to bite and even eat uninfected people thereby infecting them. When Oh Joon-woo turns on the television, he is surprised to see how chaotic the country is. As he reaches his balcony, Joon-woo sees a chaotic and panicked crowd fleeing and running for their lives. Pandemonium is breaking out. Traffic accidents are numerous. Oh Joon-woo notices a girl calling out for her mother. When her mother finds the girl, their embrace become a violent attack as the girl starts to devour her mother.\n\nBack inside again, Oh Joon-woo hears similar noises in the hallway. As soon as he opens the door to the hallway, a neighbor named Lee Sang-chul (Lee Hyun-wook) from the next apartment barges in. Sang-chul begs Joon-woo to let him stay. Joon-woo allows him to use the bathroom. A TV report describes the transformation infected individuals experience including aggressive behavior and bleeding of the eyes that can ultimately lead to full out cannibalistic assaults. When the neighborhood exits the bathroom, Joon-woo notice a wound on his neighbor\'s hand. Shortly thereafter, Sang-chul\'s eyes turns red and his body convulses. Joon-woo pushes his neighbor back out of the apartment and into the hallway and locks the door to save his own life. Through the peephole, Joon-woo obverse a hideous murder in the hallway. Blood seeps under the door into his apartment. Joon-woo secures the front door by pushing his refrigerator in front of it.\n\nOh Joon-woo receives messages from his family assuring him that they are safe. He checks his food supply and regrets of not going to the grocery the day before. He dedicates himself to survival. As night has fallen, Joon-woo falls asleep on the couch. The next day, Oh Joon-woo is awakened by a TV discussion of professor Kim Yeon-jeong of the causes of the behavioral changed attributed to a mutated viral infection. The professor states that there seems to be a connection to the right brain which is the source the very aggressive behaviors observed.\n\nThe internet, as Joon-woo soon finds out, is filled with people asking about their loved ones and putting up addresses under the #Alive. Seeking his own rescue, Joon-woo puts up a similar post. He also comes across a disturbing video of a rather stupid young man, who is hanging outside the terrace of a multiple story building with his phone attached to a selfie stick in a bid to get a signal. The young man is excited when gets a signal only to lose it soon after. He then stretches on tiptoes, loses his footing and falls from his perch.\n\nJoon-woo sends out his drone to get a brief glimpse of the terror going on in the apartments around him before his cell phone battery dies. Then he even loses the connection to his streaming video game service. He falls asleep but is awakened by a commotion outside. From his deck, Joon-woo observes a policewoman (Oh Hye-won) being torn to bits by fellow police officers now turned into zombies. Joon-woo shouts at the predators out of sympathy, but the policewoman is overwhelmed. Joon-woo\'s attempt to scare off the zombies nearly 100 meters away by yelling at them does nothing but to attract the attention of a zombie close to his home. Almost immediately, a zombie pushes his way past the refrigerator and into Joon-woo\'s apartment. Joon-woo is outside the railing hanging off his lanai when the zombie rushes him and falls several stories to the pavement below. Although Oh Joon-woo is unharmed, it seems that his encounter with the zombie has further reduced his rations. The little food in the fridge has all found its way to the bloody mess on the floor.\n\nAfter two days alone, Joon-woo records a video of his nearly miraculous survival for his subscribers. By Day 7, Joon-woo has invaded his father\'s liquor cabinet. TV news further details that the virus seems to be only spread by contact with the blood. Avoiding bites and stabs is the best way to stay free of contamination. The infected get a superior sense of strength and sensory capabilities. Many still possess the ability to perform behaviors they had before infection such as opening doors and windows or performing their occupations. Joon-woo eats his last bowl of Ramen soup. Joon-woo spills his water bottle and then discovers there is no running water in his apartment.\n\nBy Day 10, Joon-woo is frustrated by the advisory on the television stating that survivors should simply wait it out at home. He refuses to leave the apartment and end up like the infected. He recalls his mother listened to internet radio shows. His attempt to listen to the radio on his phone is foiled when he cannot find any wired earphones to serve as an antenna. All his earphones are wireless.\n\nBy Day 15, Joon-woo hallucinates that he is reuniting with his family. Waking up from the hallucination, he is left very sad. He gets a call from his mother, but the signal is so bad he barely hears a thing. He then duplicates the stunt the stupid young man on the internet had pulled earlier using a selfie stick to get better reception. He does not fall, but he clearly hears that something is not quite right with his family.\n\nIn his anger, Oh Joon-woo breaks things in his home and goes outside. There, he sees a zombie that is surprisingly slow, and he takes out his anger on the zombie using a golf club. The violence urges others to come by. Not too long after he is nearly swamped in a sea of zombies. Joon-woo manages to get to his apartment alive when zombies exiting the elevator pile up against the zombies pursuing Joon-woo down the corridor. Then Joon-woo quietly walks behind the zombies until he arrives at his front door. Once Jun-woo is behind the locked door, the zombies gather outside.\n\nBy Day 20, Joon-woo decides that it is time to take his own life. As he dangles from the noose he has tied, a laser beam projects into his house from the apartment across the yard. The beam points to the word \"NO\" on the writing on the wall. He struggles with the noose until he is freed. Joon watches the beam then point to different alphabets on the writings on the wall to spell the word, IDIOT. (Someone is finally saying it). The source of the laser beam is a girl on the lanai opposite his. Kim Yoo-bin (Park Shin-hye), seems to have been watching Joon-woo with a pair of binoculars. When Joon-woo, now freed from the noose, sees her, he waves to her excitedly. She waves back and gestures that meet again at seven o\'clock.\n\nUnlike Oh Joon-woo, Kim Yoo-bin seems very organized and has prepared her house with a series of booby traps for zombies. Joon-woo wakes up at eleven o\'clock, late for the seven o\'clock rendezvous time they had previously agreed on. Joon-woo gestures an apology and then projects his name on his phone. She reciprocates. After their brief attempt to communicate Kim Yoo-bin hears a sound and attempts to find the source. They agree to meet at seven o\'clock again. One of Kim Yoo-bin\'s traps has snared a zombie that made its way into her house. She proceeds to axe its head off.\n\nThe next morning, at the agreed upon time, Yoo-bin attempts to pass food over to Joon-woo when she sees that he is hungry. She attaches a rope to a baseball and throws it across hoping it gets into his home. The ball does not make it and it lands in the street. Oh Joon-woo then uses his drone to deliver a rope to Kim Yoo-bin. Using the rope bridge, she passes him a container of snacks and a bottle of water with the encouragement not to eat too fast. An infected firefighter pulls on the first cable, causing Yoo-bin\'s table to fly across her apartment, knocking her out, and lodge into her balcony railing. The zombie starts climbing the cable. Joon-woo distracts the zombie with his drone ultimately sacrificing it. Shortly thereafter, Yoo-bin wakes up and cuts off the hand of the infected man as her reaches her lanai. The zombie falls to his death. Joon-woo flashes a message to Yoo-bin on his phone to \"Stay Strong\".\n\nViewing his meager supplies and quite desperate, Joon-woo decides to \"go farming\". Leaving his apartment, he finds the key to his neighbor\'s door on a dead body. Joon-woo cleans out the refrigerator and finds other food, clothing, a headphone with a cord and walkie-talkies inside his neighbor\'s unit. While searching for other items, an infected sleeping zombie wake ups and attacks Joon-woo. Joon-woo manages to save himself and bring the essentials to his apartment.\n\nAfter feasting on the peanut butter he found and unsuccessfully finding a radio station with his antenna cord, Joon-woo sends a walkie-talkie and some food to Yoo-bin on the zip line. The two communicate through it. With the talkies, they eventually start to communicate. Yoo-bin is not interested in discussing Joon-woo\'s suicide attempt. Instead, they decide to make noodle soup together. Later Yoo-bin admits she is scared of heights. Joon-woo finds it illogical that she has such a fear and was still able to cut off someone\'s hand. Yoo-bin says the monsters are no longer human which relieves her of any guilt or fear. She tells Joon-woo that she fell while climbing.\n\nWhile they talk, Jun-woo asks Yoo-bin to bring out basins as he can hear heavy sounds and thinks it\'s raining. They look out the terraces, but it is not raining. Instead, they see a multitude of zombies running into both apartment complexes simultaneously. They both lie low and try to stay silent until Yoo-bin accidentally knocks over a shelf in her house. Joon-woo calls a neighboring unit on the phone to momentarily distract the zombies in front of Yoo-bin\'s apartment. Yoo-bin prepares to leave as she knows she would soon be overrun with zombies. She informs Joon-woo that her destination is the 8th floor of his apartment complex which, as she had earlier noticed, was empty. They both agree to meet up there.\n\nYoo-bin jumps out of the terrace of her home, repels down to the street and runs towards the apartment complex across the way swinging her axe to fight off numerous zombies. Joon-woo is very impressed by her bravery and runs out to help her. He knocks a zombie off the top of Yoo-bin with his golf club. They both narrowly miss being swamped by zombies as they enter the elevator to the 8th floor. They meet face to face for the first time.\n\nAs they cautiously exit the elevator, all is peaceful on the 8th floor. This lasts a few moments while they are checking for unlocked doors. Soon they are again chased by zombies. Joon-woo fights them off with a golf club while Yoo-bin finds an unlocked door. A man (Jaon Bae-soo) opens his door and quickly pulls them in before the Joon-woo and Yoo-bin are bitten and eaten. Once inside, they all share their stories of survival.\n\nThe man seems kind and offers them water and food. He says he has enough for them to survive until a rescue team comes around. They are overjoyed but it seems their joy is short lived as they soon discover that the food was laced with drugs. The man zip ties their wrists while they slumber. He locks Yoo-bin in a room with a sky painted on the ceiling.\n\nYoo-bin wakes up under a mobile in a locked room. The man is planning to offer Yoo-bin as a meal to his starving wife (Lee Chae-kyung) now turned zombie. Yoo-bin realizes that she\'s in danger and cries for help. Joon-woo wakes up and threatens the older man with a gun they previously had recovered outside. The man holds the wife\'s harness telling Joon-woo keeping his wife alive is something he must do. He offers to let Joon-woo survive of he just abandons Yoo-bin. When Joon-woo threatens to kill the man, he releases the tether holding back his wife. Joon-woo leaps toward the tether but it has mostly slips away under the door. Sounds of an attack are heard and then the room goes silent. The older man opens the door to see what is going on. Yoo-bin manages to save herself by pulling the fabric over the infected wife\'s head. The older man, submits himself to his wife attack. Yoo-bin shoots them both with the gun.\n\nThe gunfire only draws the attention of more zombies. Seeing the end so close, Joon-woo and Yoo-bin decide to shoot themselves instead of getting bit and become infected. Just before Joon-woo pulls the trigger on his partner, they hear the rescue helicopters. With hope rekindled in them, they struggle hard to make it to the rooftop of the apartment building. The use a push cart to clear a path through the zombies. Then Joon-woo holds off a hoard of zombies in the stair well with a bicycle while Yoo-bin escapes to the roof. Joon-woo eventually pushes the zombies backward giving himself enough time and distance to join Yoo-bin on the roof. The choppers, however, are no longer in sight.\n\nJun-woo screams at the sky, \"There are survivors here! We are still alive!\" The zombies find their way to the rooftop, push open the door and they gradually creep closer and closer to Joon-woo and Yoo-bin. Just when they are about to overwhelmed by the zombies, the military appear in a helicopter and shoot at the zombies while helping the survivors into the chopper. Once aboard and flying to safety, Joon-woo receives a message from his family assuring him of their safety. He looks towards Yoo-bin and they are both glad to be alive. A news report details how valuable posting on social media has been in locating survivors in the urban areas.

A crowd gathers to protest and provoke the British troops who, though heavily armed, can only respond by trying to hold the crowd back with non-lethal force.\n\nOne soldier is hit by a rock and drops his rifle to the ground. In the confusion, a young boy seizes it and runs off through the mob. Hook and another soldier, Thompson, pursue him. As the crowd\'s protest violently escalates, the soldiers and police pull out, leaving the two soldiers behind. Hook and Thompson are severely beaten by a mob, until a sympathetic woman manages to calm things down. However, Thompson is suddenly shot dead at point blank range by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) gunman Paul Haggerty. With the crowd physically attacking him, Hook flees through streets and back alleys, eludes his pursuers, and hides in an outhouse until dark.\n\nA Protestant youngster brings Hook to a local pub that serves as a front for Loyalists. There, Hook glimpses a Loyalist group in a back room, constructing a bomb under the guidance of a member of the Military Reaction Force (MRF), the British Army\'s covert counter-insurgency unit. Hook steps outside the pub just before an enormous explosion destroys the building, killing or injuring many of those inside, including the young boy who brought him there. Hook flees once more into the dark streets. Unaware that the Loyalist bombers have blown themselves up accidentally, the PIRA and Official Irish Republican Army (OIRA) factions accuse each other of being responsible for the bombing.\n\nTwo Catholics, Eamon and his daughter Brigid, discover Hook as he lies in a street unconscious and injured by shrapnel. They take him to their home in the Divis Flats area before discovering he is a British soldier. Eamon, a former army medic, stitches Hook\'s wounds.\n\nDespite the PIRA\'s having recently taken control of the area from the OIRA, Eamon contacts senior OIRA official Boyle for help, expecting a more humane solution than the PIRA faction would allow. Boyle, less radical and violent than the younger PIRA members, has a working relationship with the MRF and tells MRF Captain Browning, leader of the local MRF section, of Hook\'s whereabouts and asks in return that Browning kill James Quinn, a key leader of the PIRA faction.\n\nMeanwhile, Quinn and his PIRA squad have been tailing Boyle since the pub explosion and saw him visit Eamon\'s flat without knowing why he was there. Sensing danger, Hook flees the flat, taking an assault knife he finds in a bag. He eludes the PIRA men but, unable to evade Haggerty, Hook stabs and kills him.\n\nQuinn\'s group captures Hook and takes him to a hideout. Quinn orders Sean, a young teenager, to murder Hook. When Sean hesitates, Quinn prepares to execute Hook himself, only to leave when Browning\'s group arrives. Sergeant Lewis of Browning\'s group shoots Sean, to Hook\'s horror. Lewis then attempts to strangle Hook to prevent him from informing others about the bomb.\n\nAs Lieutenant Armitage and his men enter in support of Browning, Armitage sees Lewis\' attempt to kill Hook. Sean raises himself and shoots Lewis dead before being shot again, this time by Armitage. Browning finds Quinn, and rather than arresting him, tells him Boyle wants him dead, then lets him go. As Quinn leaves, Browning tells him he will be in touch soon, and he expects him to be helpful.\n\nHook is returned to his barracks. Later, despite a formal complaint by Armitage, the commanding officer dismisses the incident involving Hook, Lewis, and Sean as a confused situation that merits no further inquiry. In the final scene, Hook returns to England and reunites with Darren.',944,11000000,'GB',3200000),(4,'\'G\' Men','1935-05-04',83,0,'James “Brick” Davis, a struggling attorney, owes his education to a mobster, but always has refused to get involved with the underworld.

Nina (Shirley Jane Rickert), a young half-Native American girl whose mother has recently died, must find her white father in order to claim her hefty inheritance of $50,000 by making Chris Morrell (John Wayne) her guardian. Of course, a defenseless heiress seems like easy pickings to some of the Wild West\'s most dastardly thugs, including Sam Black (Yakima Canutt), who is soon on her trail. Thankfully, Nina has a noble guardian in cowboy Chris Morrell who vows to get the girl safely to her estranged father. While packing for their trip, there is a knock on the door.

Chris climbs up on a bluff and lassos Shorty who has stayed behind to tend to Sam\'s gang\'s horses. He raises Shorty up like a counterweight as Chris repels down and then chases off the horses, save one on which Chris makes his getaway. Chris, however, is still suffering the effects of the blow to his head. He passes out at the edge of a stream. Nina makes her way to Bud Moore\'s ranch only to discover it is owned by someone else. The new owner, Vic Byrd (Jack Rockwell) is gruff and commandeers Nina as kitchen help for a friendly man named Matt Downing (George Hayes) who runs that part of the ranch operation. He is familiar with Chris Morrell. Meanwhile, in the town of Snake River, Clara Moore is checking on an order of calico when the Snake River Express office is robbed of $6000 by a man in a checkered shirt and black hat. On his escape, the desperado comes across unconscious Chris Morrell and takes his shirt and hat leaving his own on Chris and rides away. A short time later, Clara rides by in her horse and buggy. She finds Chris unconscious and revives him with a damp cloth. She tells the revived Chris that the only thing for her to do is turn him into the sheriff. Chris tries to convince Clara that the clothes he has on are not his. He tells Clara about his little partner, Nina, who he sent to Bud Moore\'s place. Clara reveals she is Bud Moore\'s sister, and that Bud was killed in the range wars several months earlier. When he reveals himself to be Chris Morrell, Clara declares that Bud said he was the best friend a man could have. She suggests changing his shirt at her place. At Clara\'s home, Chris tells Clara the story of Nina\'s origins of her Indian mother and no-account white father when her brother Jim (Buffalo Bill Jr.) arrives. Chris recognizes him as the man who changed shirts with him but does not tell Clara because it would break her heart and because \"snakes like him usually die of their own poison\".

He limps off but it isn\'t long until he meets Jim and Vic riding with the horses and interested in a conversation with Sam Black. Vic Byrd bargains with Sam to cut him in for $10,000 and Chris Morrell s scalp to turn over the girl at his ranch. Matt Downing rides up to find Chris Morrell and takes him back to the Byrd Ranch. Jim and Vic head to the tree stump where the money is hidden. Once they arrive, Jim retrieves the money only to be shot so Vic could claim both shares. Matt and Chris are startled when they hear the gunshots nearby. They ride up just as Vic gallops off with all the money. Jim tells Matt and Chris that Vic is heading to the ranch to hand over Nina to Sam Black. Chris orders Matt to take Jim to a doctor and heads to the ranch to save Nina.

In the story, two friends enter a car race to win a dune buggy. But the problem arises when it becomes impossible to share the dune buggy. So the competition began between the friends to eat sausages and beer. But before the result, a goon came and set fire to their red dune buggy. In a fit of rage, the two friends get mad and beat the goon off, forcing their leader to buy dune buggies for each of them. But eventually, one of them caught fire again, leaving another dune buggy on which the two friends continued to fight.\n\nThe scene shifts to another story where those two friends\' sons, Carezza (Edoardo Pesce) and Sorriso (Alessandro Roja), playfully run away with the red dune buggy of their fathers, but are blocked by a group of bad guys who offer to gamble. Despite Carezza\'s disapproval, Sorriso agrees but ultimately loses. As a result, the bad boys escape with the dune buggy as per the terms of the gamble. This time the time-line shifts to the present, where Carezza and Sorriso have grown up. Carezza lives with his dog, Geremia. He is a mechanic.\n\nAt a circus, we are introduced to a female ringmaster named Miriam (Alessandra Mastronardi). But immediately, a group of goons named Cobras, who belong to a notorious businessman named Torsillo (Christian De Sica), arrive at the circus (where Carezza was fixing Miriam\'s car). But Carezza isn\'t afraid of them, as even with a strong slap of his hand, Scajone (Massimiliano Rossi), the leader of the Cobras, fails to turn Carezza\'s head. Torsillo has his eye on Miriam\'s circus grounds, where he wants to establish his Torsillo Tower, but Miriam is a tough player to give it to him. While at Miriam\'s Carezza had seen the flier for a local race that had a dune buggy as the first prize. Carezza leaves the circus grounds. Then comes the grown-up Sorriso, who is still angry about the disappearance of the old dune buggy and has seen the same flier for the race as Carezza. Sorriso approaches Carezza at his garage. But Carezza refuses to work with Sorriso. They want to settle the case again by naming them in the competition like their predecessors. Torsillo\'s son, Raniero (Francesco Bruni), who lacks diplomatic intelligence and common sense like his father, is named in the competition as well. Unfortunately, he doesn\'t even reach the halfway point of the race due to his own failure. On the contrary, Carezza and Sorriso repeat history by reaching the dune buggy together. So both are declared winners.\n\nThe decision of who will be the owner of the dune buggy is still a doubtful decision to them, so they try to pick the actual winner of the dune buggy through the old-fashioned beer and sausage competition, but the Cobras steal their dune buggy (on behalf of Torsillo and Raniero) while Carezza and Sorriso are busy shoving their mouths with sausages. Miriam arrives at the tavern and wants Carezza to help her defend the circus, but Carezza is not interested. Sorriso tries his best to form a love angle with Miriam, but she is not interested. Carezzo and Sorriso suspect Miriam for stealing their dune buggy. but after a lot of heckling (Including a slapping contest with Miriam\'s cousin Armandino (Michael Schermi)), Miriam tells him that their dune buggy is with Torsillo, but as a cost of that, she demands that when Sorriso approaches Torsillo, he will have to threaten him to take his eyes off the circus grounds. Carezza and Sorriso muster their courage to reach Torsillo and threaten him to return their dune buggy, but not having planned, they can\'t tell if they can do any harm to Torsillo. Torsillo promises to return the buggy by the next day, if they leave the meeting with his investors. On his return, Sorriso pulls up the model of Torsillo Tower & takes it away with him, saying that Torsillo has to get his eyes off the land of the circus. Torsillo thinks he can answer it differently.\n\nTorsillo arrives at Carezza\'s place to prank them with a small toy model of the dune buggy. Carezza and Sorriso knew they wouldn\'t get their car back so easily, so after Torsillo\'s departure, they beat the Cobra gang, breaking all the bones in their bodies. Raniero wants to return the buggy to the guys, but Torsillo tells Raniero to be mean and never blink in a fight. Raniero is not convinced but decides to be mean, to impress his father. While Carezza and Sorriso are watching Miriam\'s circus performance, Torsillo\'s son Raniero arrives with the dune buggy. When Carezza comes running in joy to see his car, Raniero sets fire to the yellow roof of the dune buggy, causing the entire circus to burn. Carezza rescues his dog Geremia, and Sorriso runs to save Miriam. But Miriam learns from her brother that their circus tiger has escaped. Together, Miriam Sorriso and Carezza plan to make Torsillo\'s end.\n\nThe next day, when Torsillo throws a party with his business clients, Carezza walks in as a musician and catches Scajone\'s eye. while Torsillo\'s enlarged and more powerful Cobra gang attacks them, Carezza and Sorriso, along with the circus men, beat the gangsters of the Cobra gang and make their situation worse. When Miriam finally blocks Torsillo\'s way after a violent riot, he points a gun at Miriam. But she survives when her escaped circus tiger pounces on Torsillo. Carezza and Sorriso get their dune buggies back. But the fight for rights over it continues, so Sorriso and Cariza go back to the restaurant for a beer and sausage competition. But while they are both busy eating, Miriam escapes with the dune buggy again.\n\nWe also saw before Miriam came to disrupt Carezza and Sorriso\'s sausage competition, right before their dune buggy was stolen in the first place. However, it is quite possible that Miriam stole the dune buggy and left it near Torsillo so that Sorriso and Carezza take their revenge and Miriam gets her land back. It could be a possibility that Miriam is sketching a new plan, but what is that?

A girl gets access to Stinger, an underworld boss, and gets into his bed as easily. Spider exposes her as an infiltrated agent, and he is well protected, but the girl defeats them all in hand-to-hand fight and using their guns against them. But Spider points a gun to her head. She drops her gun, then drops the white sheet that she had managed to keep wrapping her body, exposing her breasts to him. Spider downs his eyes from her face to her breasts, as she - with a slight movement of her chest muscles, puts several slugs into his stomach. Slider falls down in a pool of gore, just as he recognizes the girl who killed him is the West Bloc agent 009-1.\n\nSlinger\'s girlfriend, Butterfly, is at the \"morgue\", choosing people to be killed to extract their vital organs for transplants. 009-1 gains access to the place that is protected by fingerprint detection, using Slinger\'s forefinger, and then she throws Slinger\'s severed arm at Butterfly\'s feet, with contempt. 009-1 disposes of a handful of bodyguards in a quick gunfight, then battles Butterfly hand-to-hand, countering the girls\' attacks with blade weapons. Before running away, Butterfly calls 009-1, \"Monster!\"\n\n009-1 remembers in flash-back how she had lost her parents, was chosen by the 00 Department to serve the Western Bloc, and was trained as a spy. The Department head, 020, instructs her to rescue Dr. Clyne, the scientist responsible for Project Faust - the mass production of human beings. Dr. Clyne has been captured in her lab by three East Bloc agents, now waiting for ex-filtration from J Country. 009-1 arrives on the premises, already surrounded by an SMA team, and the Officer taunts her, ending by saying that it\'s true \"what they say about you, that you\'re not just human, you\'re a monster\".\n\nUsing her cyborg powers, 009-1 bypasses the net of infra-red rays that protects the compound. Yet, she is attacked by the three East Bloc agents in a ferocious battle hand-to-hand and with knives, but she beats them. Agent Shadow receives a message from headquarters, \"There is no rescue.\" Shadow can\'t believe her ears, \"Motherland has abandoned us,\" she says, and the three agents fall in despair. 009-1 simply turns her back on them, and leaves.\n\n009-1 unties the ropes binding Dr. Clyne, and tries to bring up the subject that Dr. Clyne is her cyber mother, but the other woman turns her back on her and leaves the room. When they pass through the entrance room, the three agents are about to commit suicide, but 009-1 stops them, arguing that \"Our lives never belong to ourselves.\" East Agent #2 says, \"We get abandoned once we\'re useless. This is the destiny of spies. You\'re the same!\" Dr. Clyne picks a gun from the floor and in quick succession, shoots the enemies through their heads, and says \"It\'s a waste of time.\" Turning to 009-1, she adds, \"Don\'t show me a face like that, you\'re just a tool.\" Dr. Clyne gives orders to the SMA team, and in a brief exchange with 009-1, this one understands that the traffic of organs is something Dr. Clyne is comfortable with.\n\n009-1 stays a moment alone with a young man guinea-pig whom she had saved the day before from the \"morgue\". He doesn\'t remember anything about him, and she names him Chris, \"because your eyes make me think of crystals\", then asks him to sing the lullaby song he had been singing before. Closing her eyes, 009-1 seems to remember (flash-back) her father singing that lullaby to her and her brother when both were children. Sounds of shooting bring 009-1 to the present.\n\nOutside, Miriam - a cyborg in black leather - is disposing of the elements of the SMA team, as they find that their automatic weapons are useless against her immediate body reconstruction powers. 009-1 gets out and sees Miriam just as she finished killing the team leader. They fight using karate and some pro-wrestling moves. In a sort of bear hug, 009-1 unzips her red leather top to expose her breasts, and shoot Miriam in the face. But while 009-1 picks her discarded gun from the floor, Miriam has reconstructed herself, and attacks her again. The appearance of Chris creates a distraction, but then Miriam ends up by shooting Chris - as 009-1 (flash-back) remembers a similar scene when her kid brother was abducted from home. 009-1 is able to perform a medical check on him, and concludes that his life is not at risk.\n\nShe runs to the rooftop in time to see Dr. Clyne\'s being taken away in a helicopter that shoots a missile at her. 009-1 runs away in a motorbike, and the helicopter gives chase shooting missiles at her. Some hit at a street full of humble people, who run away. A little girl, Koto, falls, and 009-1 instinctively protects her with her body as (flash-back) her mother had done to protect her, being shot dead by soldiers. Koto\'s mother watches 009-1\'s wounds being restored on the spot, and mumbles, \"Monster!\" That downs on her, \"I am... a monster.\"\n\nLater, Chris is in 009-1\'s room, in bed - apparently strong already, and they seem to be romantically attracted, with no common memories but that lullaby song. She tells him that her real name is Mirine. [Mylene in a different transliteration] They make love - without stripping.\n\n020 is displeased that 009-1 has not gone straight to headquarters after her mission, and that she failed to rescue Dr. Clyne to attend to Chris. 020\'s Secretary tells her that the other agents will take care of the matter, and asks 009-1 to hand out her gun. As she does, the Secretary says with a mocking smile, \"Bye, monster.\"\n\n009-1 KO\'s two armed guards, knocks down the Assistant with a punch to the face, and (flash-back) using the same words of Agent #2, tells 020 that she is not a tool to be abandoned... She runs away on her motorbike, but at her room she finds Chris with his face in blood, and a bomb explodes. 020 receives a report of this, and seems happy.\n\nIn a rich mansion with a swimming-pool, a magnate - and five young women in bikinis - is playing chess with a set of pieces based on Ancient Egypt. 009-1, disguised as a blonde with a wig and in a bikini, attacks a maid named Sherry, forcing a lesbian scene with her - that some of the girls watching, is interesting. But while fondling and kissing Sherry against a window in a corner, 009-1 is progressing in her work. \"Is the map of area D really here?\" \"Don\'t worry - The party host, Alan Lau, has it.\" \"How do I get it?\" \"By playing chess with Lau,\" the undercover agent Sherry answers. \"And betting your body for it.\"\n\nSome time later, with all the bodyguards and waitresses watching around them, 009-1 is playing chess against Lau, and he acknowledges that she\'s a good player. Just as she makes a decisive move to checkmate, and demands her pay. He asks a small computer from a servant, and introduces a sort of cylindrical pen in it. It produces a moving image of its content (on a digital screen in the air) that the West Bloc agent recognizes. But Mr. Lau tells her that that military facility is now obsolete, so he wants to know, \"Why are you so interested in this?\" \"To say the truth, I\'m interested in ruins. The game is over, give it to me.\" Instead, he gives back the computer to the servant, and approaches her, to smell her golden hair. \"It smells so good. Smells like money.\" Suddenly, he lets himself fall on a couch, pointing a gun at her - as all the bodyguards also pull their guns on her. He demands that she tells him the truth.\n\nSuddenly the door opens, and Butterfly makes her entrance on the scene, in her usual black lace dress. Using automatic weapons, she kills a number of bodyguards, others with her fan provided with iron fangs. Five bikini girls hide on another couch, and two maids behind a cupboard. Lau still has his gun, but he has not shot yet. He wants to know who the intruder is. \"None of your business,\" Butterfly says. \"I want the blondie [sic] over there.\" Then, addressing 009-1, \"You can never fool my eyes... monster!\" With a look of resignation, the \"blonde\" takes her wig and throws it at the muzzle of Butterfly\'s hand machine-gun, deviating her line of fire. In a somersault, 009-1 picks a discarded gun from the floor, to shoot back at Butterfly, but she has attacked Lau, and uses his body as a shield. 009-1 shoots at his lower chest and belly, and he falls dying on the couch, yet commenting on her shooting, \"Perfect...\"\n\nBoth rival women throw away their empty guns, and come to grips, whirling around the room and falling on the pool outside. Wrestling in the water is fierce, both women attempting to choke or dunk the other (with underwater camera). They come out of the pool, and Butterfly has the upper-hand, and a gun she picks from the floor from one of the guards. She is shot dead by Sherry, who makes a surprise appearance from inside the house. After they leave, 020\'s Secretary appears on the scene (apparently she was in the house already) and looks at the body of Butterfly afloat in the water.\n\nSherry takes 009-1 to her place, despite she tells her that Department D is tracking her down. The relationship between Sherry and her teenage brother Kai, seems to awake some emotion in 009-1. After dinner, the two young women talk about Dr. Clyne, and 009-1 says she is still looking for her, because the scientist may know something about Mirine\'s past. Sherry dreams of leaving Intelligence, and live a normal life with her brother.\n\nTogether, they visit the ruins where Department D is located. Mirine\'s runs after the sound (or fantasy) of the lullaby song, but when she thinks she has reached her mother on a rocking chair (amidst flash-backs of her youth) she is neutralized with a special weapon by someone. Mirine awakes tied to a gurney, deprived of her red leather outfit but with a metal bra on and still wearing red knee boots. The gurney is large enough to accommodate Miriam, wearing a fetishist black leather outfit, astride Mirine and fondling and kissing her.\n\nA man tells Mirine that \"Miriam was made from the prototype of your mama,\" and indeed (amidst of flash-backs of her youth) Mirine associates the face of her mother with that of the woman who\'s now kissing her. The man comes forward, and Mirine recognizes Chris, who only had pretended to be dead. He explains his plan to help her get her memories back. As he talks, Miriam has taken Mirine off the gurney, though keeping her in control in a choke hold, and now the girl recognizes Paul in the man she had named Chris when they first met. Now, he proposes that they should unite against those who had wiped off her memories. He had been raised in the East Bloc as an agent, and now he has a plan to make an atomic attack against a West Bloc and an East Bloc targets, so that both blocs annihilate each other in all out war - assuming the first attacker was the other bloc... \"A new world will arise from the ashes of the old.\" \"It\'s wrong!\" Mirine counters. She wants to know where Dr. Clyne is. He refuses to tell, and Miriam attacks Mirine. In a moment of respite in the fighting, Mirine adds, \"A full-scale war will send many people to hell. Many will lose their love, like us.\" Paul is determined, though. The two women fight again, but Miriam subdues Mirine, as Paul tells further of his plan to unite his and Mirine\'s body to create a new generation of people. He tells her that the 00 project had failed, because all the orphans that had been operated on had all died, only 009-1 had survived. She tells him that there are eight other agents like her, and he counters that she\'s wrong - she has been lied to by 020. \"Mirine, you are the only monster in this world.\" Even the experiments with robots and genetic engineering had failed... From the darkness of the room, Dr. Clyne steps forward to confirm Paul\'s words. It was she who had put Mirine to sleep, and now she considers that mutants like 009-1 are obsolete, and she has developed new tools: living-dead mutants. A dozen zombie-like creatures stagger onto the room, and Sherry is among them. Mirine attacks Dr. Clyne, who loses her ray gun, but she orders the living-dead mutants to attack. Suddenly, the group gets quite alive, and Mirine has to fight against the group, damaging many. Dr. Clyne is not worried, because \"Despite how badly damaged they are, the living-dead will always stand up again.\" Dr. Clyne even laughs about it - the perfection of her work. Mirine listens to Sherry\'s thoughts [by telepathy], though: \"I wanna get back to Kai.\" Paul mumbles, \"It\'s ugly,\" presses a button on a remote control, and the living-dead turn their attack from Mirine to Dr. Clyne. Her laughter changes into worry, she fires a pistol onto the group, without avail. Sherry has a choke hold on Mirine, as the other living-dead gore and kill the lady scientist.\n\nMirine still refuses to be part of Paul\'s incestuous plan, and Paul signals Sherry to kill Mirine. The two women fight. Sherry gets hold of Dr. Clyne\'s pistol, and shoots Mirine down, after Sherry cries tears of blood (literally). Mirine bends to close Sherry\'s eyes. \"I\'ve finally got it. The reason why I became a monster [looking up to Paul and Miriam] is to finish this crazy world. So I\'ve nothing to lose.\" Paul uses his remote control again, and a new group of living-dead surges from outside to attack Mirine. She mows them down with the gun, and her bare hands, and they all die in gore fashion. \"It seems that your heart is out of control,\" Paul comments. \"So, [looking at Miriam] at least, I want your body.\" Then, addressing Miriam, he says, \"Mama, follow me.\"\n\nMiriam attacks Mirine, and the two women fight using martial arts. Mirine gets the gun back and shoots at Miriam. Outside, Paul is looking at his watch, finding that Miriam is taking too long to meet him at the helicopter pad. Mirine tumbles out of the house in ruins, and crawls to Paul\'s feet. After her, comes Miriam, poised and controlled as usual, keeping her kicking and punching attack on Mirine, who fights back. Paul is enjoying the fight, and again calling Miriam \"mama\". Suddenly, a powerful kick sends Miriam against the helicopter\'s structure, igniting an explosion that blows it - and Miriam - away. \"My sister, why are you against me?\" Paul asks. \"Why?!\" From the helicopter wrecks, Miriam surges, reconstructed, and producing a samurai sword from nowhere. The women fight again, and the quickness of Mirine counters the deadly strikes of the perfect blade. Then, Mirine disengages from the fight, runs at her brother - who had come closer to better watch the fight - and grabs him by the neck, offering her back to Miriam. Miriam runs at her to impale her through, and Mirine sidesteps just in time for the sword to impale Paul through the stomach to his back. \"Mirine... I love you,\" says Paul dying against Miriam\'s body. Miriam steps back, so that Paul\'s body falls on the floor, and then with a precise strike, she cuts the joint of Mirine\'s metal bra, which cups fall to the floor, exposing the girl\'s breasts. Again, Mirine\'s arches her back a little, firing a number of bullets straight at Miriam\'s head, disintegrating it. Miriam\'s mechanical voice repeats a message implanted in her modified brain long ago, \"Do not fear, nothing to fear\".\n\n\"Paul, as you said, those who started conflicts should be hated. I\'ll fight against them,\" says Mirine, getting out of the ruins where Department D was housed. [end credits and inserts of movie scenes]\n\nMirine walks to Department D\'s main building, holding a metallic cylinder with her,and meets 020\'s Secretary by the door. \"You\'ve really done it, you deserve to be called a monster,\" the Secretary says. Without replying, Mirine walks into the building and places the gas cylinder on top of 020\'s desk. \"I\'ve fetched Dr. Clyne.\" \"This?\" asks 020. \"A life-saving device keeps her brain cells alive,\" she explains. \"All the data of Project Faust is in this.

D\'Leh, a young hunter, has a companion named Evolet, an orphan who was found by the tribe. D\'Leh, while hunting mammoths, manages to kill one and wins the \"White Spear\". He also wins Evolet in marriage, but feels he deserves neither since he killed the mammoth by accident.\n\nOne day, D\'Leh and several others are away when horse-raiders called the \"Four Legged Demons\" attack the Yaghal camp. The horse raiders enslave Evolet; D\'Leh, Tic\'Tic, KaRen, and Baku pursue them to save her. They enter a rain-forest where they catch up with the raiding party. During the night D\'Leh rescues Evolet, but as they are trying to escape from the pursuing raiders, they are attacked by a large pack of terror birds. Tic\'Tic gets wounded and Baku and Ka\'Ren and Evolet are re-captured. Continuing, they meet others whose loved ones were taken by the raiders. D\'Leh and Tic\'Tic befriend Nakudu, leader of the Naku tribe. He tells D\'Leh of a prophecy: whoever talks to a Smilodon that they call the \"Spear-Tooth\" will help free their people. D\'Leh had earlier saved the Spear-Tooth from drowning in a trap, and it had spared his life. D\'Leh realizes the prophecy was about him. Nakudu explains that his loved ones were taken in the \"Great Red Birds\", ships with large red sails, to the \"Mountains of the Gods\", from which no one has ever returned. They then come together with other tribes, who agree to form a coalition to pursue the raiders.\n\nThey find the ships with red sails holding Evolet and Baku. They have no means to follow the ships, so they journey through a vast desert, discovering an advanced civilization like ancient Egypt, ruled by an enigmatic figure known as \"The Almighty\", who is said to be the last survivor of his kind. The Almighty, who is regarded as a living god, possesses many thousands of slaves that he is using to build a huge pyramid complex in his honor. D\'Leh finds an escaped servant of the Almighty and notices he is wearing a bracelet worn by D\'Leh\'s father. D\'Leh\'s father left his tribe for food and found the Naku tribe before being stolen by the raiders. In a night attack, the guards of the slaves discover D\'Leh behind a pyramid. Tic\'Tic dies from injuries from killing the guards before they raise the alarm. Meanwhile, the Almighty\'s priests discover Evolet bears scars on her hand patterned after the \"Mark of the Hunter\", the constellation Orion. The priests believe it is part of a prophecy that whoever wears the mark of the Hunter is destined to kill The Almighty. D\'Leh starts a full-scale rebellion among the slaves. They cause the mammoth herd, used in building the pyramid, to stampede and kill many troops.\n\nThe Almighty offers Evolet to D\'Leh in exchange for abandoning his rebellion. The Almighty says that if D\'Leh takes his wife, his warriors can return, but the rest must be his slaves forever. D\'Leh feigns acceptance of the deal which allows him to throw a spear at The Almighty and kill him, proving that he is not a god. During the ensuing battle, the raider obsessed with Evolet kidnaps her on horseback. Evolet grabs an arrow and stabs the warlord in the side, knocking them both off the horse. D\'Leh rushes towards her, but the raider shoots her in the back. D\'Leh kills him and returns to Evolet, and she dies in his arms. The scene shifts to the tribe\'s wise woman as she breathes in deeply and then breathes out her last breath.

He believed in himself and in 12 Mighty Orphans, who, against all odds, went on to play the Football State Championship in 1938. The film fables the exemplary tale of misfits and forgotten children who became the mighty orphans, the classic underdogs. The film shows the Texas High School State Championship, 1938, where the Orphans play against the Sandies. After a devastating half-time, the narrative rolls back to 6 months earlier.\n\nWar Hero Rusty Russell (Luke Wilson) arrives in Fort Worth, Texas, with his wife Juanita (Vinessa Shaw) and young daughter to join The Masonic Home. Rusty takes the job of new math, science teacher, and football coach in the Orphan School. While Juanita is hired to teach English. Warden Frank Wynn (Wayne Knight) welcomes the new teachers and gets them accustomed to the school. Rusty soon learns of the ongoing horror in the school. Warden Frank physically assaults kids to compel them into child labor to fill his own pockets. The orphan boys lack education and are unaware of their own freedom of expression. With the help of the school\'s physician, E.P. Hall \"Doc Hall,\" (Martin Sheen) Rusty fosters a football team. Rusty believes that the game will bring self-respect and passion to these boys roaming like aimless chickens indulging themselves in an abyss of manual labor.\n\nWhat lays ahead is a series of hurdles in the Orphans\' pursuit towards the state championship. Warden Frank Wynn did everything in his power to stop the orphans from playing football. He feared that the game would bring passion in the aimless boys who would prefer to spend time on the field instead of his printing workshop. Warden Frank was a hard nut to crack, but the boys themselves were the first hurdle in Rusty\'s journey. They were hard-boiled and untrained and only a bunch of hooligans to begin with. Fortunately, Rusty and Doc Hall knew how to melt down the boys\' egos and train them appropriately. Looking at their zeal, Rusty applied for their admission in \"the Interscholastic League.\" However, the new rules stated that all players were required to take a basic aptitude test. Rusty took that as a challenge and taught the unschooled boys. To his surprise, only 12 Orphans passed the aptitude test, and thus Rusty was obliged to make a team of only 12 players. To fill the gap in the group, all the players had to play both ways, which was pretty endearing and courageous. Players include Snoggs (Jacob Lofland), Chicken (Sampley Barinaga), Wheatie (Slade Monroe). The boys trained passionately without shoes, football, and proper equipment, and Rusty left no stone upturned to transform them into mighty warriors. He gets the girls wing to stitch uniforms and helmets for his players. Now, it was time to test their mettle in their first football match.\n\nThe Mighty Orphans played their first match against their rival Polytechnic or \"The Poly Parrots\" in 1938. Though they lost the game to the Ploys, the Orphans were just warming up. They took the Texas Football Circuit by a blitz and became the Classic Underdogs in the middle of the Depression. Rusty\'s orphan team players were slim, short, and none crossed the required weight of 200 pounds. Rusty coined a spread offense technique (with a new position called the quarterback) to make up for their limitations that later gave him \"hall of fame\" recognition in Texas Sports Hall. The Mighty Orphans were on a winning spree and soon came across their nemesis \"Polytechnic\" again in the Regional Semi-Final. The orphans won the game and entered the state championship, but casualties were fatal to their future efforts. One of their key players, Fairbanks (Levi Dylan), procured severe injuries due to which he never played football again.\n\nThe orphan team had to play the state championship with only 11 players. Before the semi-final match, Warden Frank Wynn shared some confidential documents with Polytechnic team captain Luther Scarborough (Lane Garrison). But Luther didn\'t use this secret weapon until Mighty Orphans won the game against his team. While the orphans were celebrating, UIL accused Orphans team of age violations, mainly lying about their star player Hardy Brown\'s (Jake Austin Walker) age. They were suspended from the championship, and the Polytechnic team was given their place.\n\nAccording to Hardy\'s birth certificate submitted to the president of UIL, Rodney Kidd (Scott Haze) (coincidentally, Luther\'s brother-in-law), Harden Henry Brown was born on September 4th, 1920. As per his age, in 1938, he was deemed ineligible to compete at the high school level. But at the UIL assembly, Hardy told them that the birth certificate belonged to his older brother, who died a week after he was born. Mistakenly, Warden Frank gave the wrong birth certificate to Luther in his pursuit to destroy the Orphan Team. However, even after the revelations, Rodney refused to alter his decision until he got a call from President Roosevelt, who took an active interest in Mighty Orphan\'s journey. Finally, 12 Mighty Orphans got a chance to play in the state championship, and they traveled to Amarillo to unleash their hard work. In the meantime, Warden Frank was arrested by the sheriff for violating child labor laws, and his illegal printing press was closed by the principal.\n\nIn Amarillo, the narrative jumped on to follow the match after half-past time. Sandies were leading with 7 points, while orphans didn\'t score any. It was a tough fight against the Sandies, who were incredibly huge and robust for the Orphans. The orphans bled and got injured, yet they didn\'t give up. They used their \"Snoggs Special\" passing technique against the furious bulls of Sandies. But even with such endeavor, Hardy, who had the last chance to score, failed to touch the goal. Six Golden Sandies piled up on Hardy Brown to stop, and alas, they succeeded. The Mighty Orphans lost the match, though what they won that day couldn\'t be described in words. It was a belief in themselves that would go on to last their entire lives.\n\nA rolling credit sequence gives away the life of prominent characters of the film after their state championship match. Rusty\'s legacy as the greatest coach in Texas still lives on. The famed Hardy Brown is still known as one of the toughest men in the game. A single man\'s vision touched so many lives with a single pursuit, and one couldn\'t be thankful enough for an inspiring tale of their efforts.',2339,0,'US',3615193),(23,'12 Rounds','2009-03-19',108,0,'When New Orleans Police Detective Danny Fisher stops a brilliant thief from getting away with a multimillion-dollar heist, the thief\'s girlfriend is accidentally killed. After escaping from prison, the criminal mastermind enacts his revenge, taunting Danny with 12 rounds of near-impossible puzzles and tasks that he must somehow complete to save the life of the woman he loves.','New Orleans. May 16, nighttime. A team of FBI agents, led by Special Agent George Aiken (Steve Harris) and Ray Santiago (Gonzalo Menendez), monitor a street for an international terrorist, named Miles Jackson (Aidan Gillen). Using facial recognition software, they scan different people in the street. Finally, they catch sight of him. Aiken, playing with a small yellow toy car, rattles off Miles\' crimes - murder, bombings, even the decapitation of his own brother for messing up a mission. Aiken and Santiago speak to one of Miles\' confederates, Samuel, who is reluctantly cooperating with them in exchange for his brother, Joshua\'s, release.\n\nMeanwhile, Officer Danny Fisher (John Cena) and his girlfriend, Molly Porter (Ashley Scott), are at their recently-purchased home. Danny\'s on his way out and looks around for his badge, while surreptitiously sneaking his dog some noodles. After showing him where his badge is, Molly tells him to be safe. He goes out and sees his partner, Officer Hank Carver (Brian White), waiting for him in their squad car. They drive off. Danny and Hank, being best friends, talk about Danny moving in with Molly. Hank expects Danny to pop the question soon, but Danny laughs it off. They get a message from Dispatch to help the FBI out in their operation. Hank whines about them having to jump through hoops for the Feds, while the latter seldom help them out, case in point - Katrina relief.\n\nThe Feds see Miles calls Sam on his cell phone, but can\'t tap the line as Miles always uses encrypted phones. Sam reports that Miles is on his way; he\'s bringing the weapons and they\'ll be making an exchange. Aiken waits eagerly. Miles arrives at the meeting place in a cab and approaches Sam. He starts to talk business with Sam, but Sam says he can\'t do this and exposes the FBI\'s plan to arrest Miles. He then shoots Miles in the stomach and has his men drag Miles to the waiting van. He shoots out the FBI\'s cameras, after telling them to release his brother in exchange for Miles. Sam gets in the back with Miles and they drive off. Turns out Sam and Miles are working together and Miles was wearing Kevlar. Aiken finds out that the safehouse holding Sam\'s brother was attacked and two agents are dead and Joshua\'s escaped. Sam pays Miles for springing his brother. However, Miles stabs Sam to death, as he would have left him out to dry if his brother was still inside. They reach the next rendezvous, where Miles\' girlfriend, Erica Kessen (Taylor Cole), waits. She\'s already killed the van driver and passenger. He shows her the briefcase Sam gave him - it\'s full of diamonds. They get in a car and drive away.\n\nDanny and Hank, on their way to help the FBI, look at Miles\' record. They see surveillance images and video - including one of him dancing with Erica. At a traffic light, Danny spots Erica in her car. He tells Hank to follow her car. They pull her over and Hank goes over to check her licence and registration. She flirts a bit with Hank, who flirts right back. Danny stands behind the car and tells her to pop the trunk. Just then, Miles springs out of the trunk and starts shooting at the officers, hitting Hank in the butt. Erica drives off. Danny checks up on Hank and then takes off on foot, in pursuit of the car. He runs through a lot of narrow alleys, through a house, on the road. He loses his gun, after an encounter with a dog. He sees Erica\'s car coming on the road towards him. He pushes a parked boat into their path and causes them to crash. Picking up Miles\' gun, he holds it at him. Erica tries to run, but finds herself in the way of an oncoming SUV. She gets hit hard and dies. Miles is shocked and enraged. He tells Danny he\'ll remember him. As backup arrives, Danny holds him at bay, while saddened at the girl\'s death.\n\nOne year later, Danny and Hank, since promoted to detectives, blow off some steam at a pool parlor. Hank flirts with some girls and tells Danny that, in two days, it will be one whole year since they were promoted. Danny still feels bad about Erica\'s death. He leaves for home. At home, he wakes up in time for Molly to leave for her job as a nurse on the night-shift at University Hospital. He finds the bathroom floor covered with water, thanks to a broken pipe. Molly sits under it, just about giving up . She tells him that she called Phil, the plumber. Phil arrives and, seeing the mess, tells Danny that he should have got the pipe replaced two months earlier as he said he\'d take care of. Danny confessed to Molly that he was trying to save money. She seems a bit upset, but he tells her to trust him. She says she does and leaves for work.\n\nJust then, Danny gets a call on his cell phone. It\'s from Miles Jackson! He tells Danny that he\'s escaped from prison and is now back for some payback. He says that he\'s close. Danny grabs his badge and gun and runs outside the house, looking for Miles. Miles tells him that he killed his girlfriend, but Danny retorts that it was an accident. Suddenly, Danny\'s car and house (with poor Phil inside) explode, throwing Danny to the ground. After he recovers, he hears Miles tell him that it\'s their \"anniversary\" - the day that Danny got the better of him. Now he wants a rematch. The house, the car and Phil were Round 1. He tells him that he took the one thing that can never be replaced and, in return, will do the same. He challenges Danny to try and stop him. Danny hands his dog over to some neighbors and starts running towards the ferry station, where Molly is.\n\nMolly gets on the ferry. Miles\' henchman, Anthony Deluso (Travis Davis), approaches her and asks if he can use her cell phone to call his daughter. She obliges. He keeps the phone busy, preventing Danny from getting through. Miles watches from the other side, as he gets rid of his SIM card and puts a new one into his phone. Danny reaches the station a little too late. He tries to yell out to her, but is drowned out by the ferry. Seeing the ferry name, Thomas Jefferson (I think...), he commandeers a car and speeds off towards the other side. On his way over the bridge, he calls Hank and tells him that Miles Jackson escaped from prison and is trying to take Molly. He needs him to call the Department of Transportation and have the ferry stopped at the station, or he might lose Molly.\n\nReaching the station on the other side, he sprints inside and has the security personnel shut down the station. Hank and backup arrive, but it\'s too late - there\'s no sign of Molly. He tries her cell phone. Miles answers. He has Molly tied up in the back of his car. This was Round 2. The game is 12 Rounds. If, at the end of the 12 Rounds, Danny does all that Miles says and lives, he\'ll let Molly go.\n\nRound 3 - Miles will be calling a cell phone in 15 minutes. Danny has to get to the spot where he and Miles first met and, from there, find the phone. Miles hangs up and disposes of the cell phone. Danny and Hank drive to the spot where they pulled Erica over the year before. They see some graffiti on a wall, with the day\'s date (05-16-08) on it, along with a latitude and longitude. They find that the place is the firehouse where Danny\'s brother, Dave, works. Danny calls Dave and tells him to evacuate the firehouse, as there might be a bomb inside. Dave complies and, soon, all the firemen and trucks are cleared out from the firehouse. Danny and Hank arrive on the scene. Danny announces to all the firefighters to pull out their cell phones as Miles might call one of them. When time runs out, Danny hears a cell phone ringing. It\'s coming from inside a cell phone store. He runs inside and answers it. Miles congratulates him and tells him he\'s won extra time on the next round. The fire alarm segues into Round 4...\n\nRound 4 - Miles says that a fire has broken out in the New Orleans Savings and Loan. Danny has to get there and extract two security deposit boxes located on the top floor, the numbers of which are in the memory of the cell phone he\'s holding. He has 20 minutes. Danny almost has a breakdown, but Hank keeps him from losing it. Hank has a lead on the guy who helped Miles kidnap Molly. He\'ll go look into that, while Danny continues with the \"game\". Just then, the FBI shows up. Special Agents Aiken and Santiago approach Danny and ask him about Miles Jackson. Danny is livid that Miles broke out of prison and the Feds didn\'t tell him. Aiken coolly tells him to get over it and work with them, if he wants Molly back. Reluctantly, Danny hitches a ride with Aiken and Santiago, while Dave and the other firefighters head off in their firetrucks.\n\nAs they drive, the Feds tell Danny that Miles used a prison riot as cover to escape. Aiken tells him that it\'s unusual for Miles to show himself out in the open like this. This is a golden opportunity to get him. However, Danny only cares about Molly\'s safety. At the scene of the fire, Danny gets out and runs in with Dave and the others. Santiago tells Aiken that this is exactly what Miles wants and that they should stop Danny before people get hurt, however Aiken wants to use Danny as a distraction, so they can blindside Miles. Danny and Dave run through the smoke-covered corridors, looking for the security boxes. They find them, however they both have timers counting down, with less than 7 minutes remaining. Miles calls and says that Round 5 has started.\n\nRound 5 - One of the boxes is a bomb, while the other contains a clue to the next round. He has to get to the Nicholls Street Wharf in less than 7 minutes. If he doesn\'t get there in time, the bomb goes off. Since time is a constraint, Miles advises him to use a firetruck. With 6 minutes left and a long way downstairs, Danny decides to go out the window. Seeing a huge spool of cable, he tells Dave to anchor down one end, while he throws the rest of it out the window. Carrying the two boxes in a bag, he goes down the cable. Finding himself out of cable and some feet to go, he lets go and crashes through some scaffolding, much to the horror of the onlookers. Recovering quickly, he hijacks a firetruck and races through the streets of New Orleans, causing quite a lot of damage along the way. With less than a 20 seconds to go, he reaches the edge of the wharf. Miles calls him and tells him he\'s too late. Danny waits with bated breath for the bomb to go off. However, a bell goes off from inside one of the boxes. Knowing it\'s the bomb, Danny grabs it and throws it into the water, where it explodes harmlessly. That signals the start of the next round.\n\nRound 6 - From atop the Hotel Monteleone, Miles watches Danny standing near the firetruck as the cops and Feds approach. Danny demands to talk to Molly, but Miles promises him that he will show her to him. He tells him that the other box contains the clue. The box is handed over to the bomb squad, who saw it open and declare it clear. The Feds give Danny a new cell phone, through which they can track him and the calls. The clue in the box is a room-keycard for the Hotel Monteleone. Cops, Feds and SWAT rush into the hotel. They raid the room and find it empty. To his anguish, Danny finds a couple of Polaroids of a gagged and bound Molly. The Feds look at the security camera footage and see Miles holding a sheet of paper up, which reads \"WE ARE STILL HERE\". They see him talking with a heavyset man, named Willie Dumaine (Peter Navy Tuiasosopo). Danny goes to speak to Willie about Miles. Willie shows him where they went - they took an old elevator to the roof. Danny and Willie get on the elevator. As they ascend, a small charge fixed to the elevator motor goes off, stopping the elevator. Danny sees his cell phone has no signal there. He tries to get the elevator service phone, but finds a small laptop there instead. He opens it and sees a video of Molly tearfully reading off a sheet of paper as Miles stands nearby. She says that, at the conclusion of the message, they have 60 seconds to get off the elevator before it freefalls to the bottom. She says the next clue is inside the lobby. The video ends and a timer starts counting down from 60 seconds. Danny climbs through a service hatch and starts to pull Willie through. It\'s a gigantic effort considering Willie\'s girth. He manages to get Willie up onto the top of the elevator. With almost no time left, Danny tells Willie to take his hand as he climbs along the shaft wall. However, Willie\'s back is blown and he can\'t get up. The bomb on top explodes, sending the elevator and the unfortunate Willie down to the ground in freefall, as Danny watches in despair. The elevator crash is pops loose a gas line. The hotel and surrounding blocks are evacuated. Danny walks out, despondently. His phone rings. Aiken tells him to wait as they prepare to trace the call. Aiken tells him to keep Miles on for 30 seconds. Miles, from inside a streetcar, speaks to Danny. Danny is enraged and frustrated, but tries to stall. However, Miles figures it out and hangs up before 30 seconds, thereby cutting off the tracker.\n\nRound 7 - Miles calls again and tells him that the clue to the next round is in the hotel lobby. It\'s a picture of a lonely man. He\'ll call him in 2 minutes. Danny goes to the lobby and searches. He finds the picture and finds \"CLAIBORNE & TOULOUSE\" written on a Post-It on the back. The phone rings. Santiago tells him not to answer it, but Aiken demands he do it. Danny answers the phone. Miles tells him to be there alone in 10 minutes and he \"may have a 50-50 chance in having the time of [his] life\". As Danny leaves, Aiken admonishes Santiago.\n\nAt Claiborne and Toulouse, Danny waits anxiously. He sees a bus pull up - Bus number 5050. Realizing that\'s what Miles meant, he gets on. To his bemusement, he finds Molly on board, shaken and scared. He sees she\'s wearing a bomb underneath her jacket. Sitting nearby is Miles, who tells them to sit. He goes over to Danny and pulls out the wire he\'s wearing. However, the Feds hear his voice and realize he\'s on the bus. Aiken orders a strike team to prepare an assault. In the bus, Miles handcuffs Danny to a bar. He shows Danny his PDA, on which he\'s pressing his thumb. If his thumb goes off the screen, 10 seconds later, a small charge sends a nail into Molly\'s heart, killing her, and 30 seconds later, the bomb explodes. He gives Danny an envelope, with a phone number on it, as the clue to the next round. Aiken orders a couple of snipers to take position on the overpass, under which the bus will go soon. One will shoot a hole in the window, while the other one will kill Miles. Aiken doesn\'t care who gets killed, as long as Miles is one of them. As they approach the overpass, Danny notices the snipers and pulls Miles and Molly down to the floor of the bus, just as they open fire. He gets grazed in the shoulder, as the snipers unload on the bus. The bus grinds to a halt and everyone runs outside. Miles ushers Molly out of the bus and blends with the others. Danny, handcuffed and wounded, is helpless to stop them. By the time, the Feds get to the bus, Miles is in the wind. When Danny is freed, he comes out and punches Aiken in the face. He tells them that if Miles had died, everyone on the bus would have been blown up. Hank shows up, while Danny gets his wound treated. Danny is upset that he was so close to Molly and couldn\'t help her. Hank consoles him, telling him that he has located the man who helped Miles - Anthony Deluso. He has his location and they will go find him. Danny tells him to be careful as he leaves.\n\nRound 8 - Santiago approaches Danny and offers his help. Danny calls the number on the envelope. Miles tells him that there are 5 numbers inside the envelope. Four of them are for cell phones wired to bombs in different city locations. Only one will disarm all 4 of them. If he dials wrong, the bomb attached to the receiving phone will explode. If he doesn\'t dial within 1 minute, all 4 will explode. Realizing that the numbers are codes, Danny and Santiago start inputting the numbers as text messages. With no time left, Danny dials one randomly. Miles answers and tells him he got it wrong.\n\nRound 9 - He tells them that Streetcar 907\'s brakes have been disabled and the radio is out. Danny\'s task is to stop the streetcar before it causes a lot of damage. Danny and Santiago drive off. Santiago tries to call the DoT about it, but is put on hold. Danny says that the best way to stop it would be to shut down its power.\n\nMeanwhile, Hank and his team prepare to raid Deluso\'s apartment. However Deluso gets wind of it and bails. Hank and another cop follow Deluso through the streets on foot.\n\nIn Streetcar 907, the driver realizes the brakes are shot and the radio is out. He tries to stop the car but it won\'t. Danny swerves his car in front of the streetcar, trying to slow it down. He tries to climb on top of it and take out the power from the roof, but to no avail. He gets back in the car and drives towards a nearby power transformer. He and Santiago jump out just in time as the car slams into the power transformer, shutting off electricity for the whole neighborhood. The streetcar, now powerless, slows down, but not by much. Danny and Santiago run along it, clearing people out of the way, until it grinds to a halt.\n\nRound 10 & 11 - Miles calls Danny. Danny jokes that it\'s getting too easy. Miles tells Danny that Round 10 was him and Hank taking Deluso. So Round 11 is where he takes his best friend, Hank. Fearing the worst, Danny tries calling Hank, but it keeps going to voice-mail.\n\nIn a welding factory, Hank walks carefully, gun at the ready, looking for Deluso. He finds himself at gunpoint. Deluso taunts him, telling him that Miles always plans for stuff like this. Suddenly, an anti-personnel mine activates. Hank taunts him back, saying that he doesn\'t feature in Miles\' plans. The mine explodes, killing Hank and Deluso.\n\nDanny gets word from Aiken that the welding factory blew up and Hank was seen entering it. It\'s a good bet that he didn\'t make it. Danny is heartbroken. Aiken goes up to him and tells him that, some time ago, Miles stole 3 Stingers from the military. They were tracked to Pakistan, but Aiken lost Miles on the day of the deal. A few days later, one of the stolen Stingers shot down a plane over Islamabad. He shows Danny the yellow toy car he carries around with him. It was the only thing that was intact in the wreckage. He had forgotten that it isn\'t about Miles, but about the people he\'s hurt and those he\'s going to hurt. Aiken volunteers to help Danny find Molly.\n\nRound 12 - Miles calls Danny. He tells him that, in a few minutes, it will be exactly one year since Erica\'s death. All Danny has to do is find Molly. She has a bomb strapped to her chest and only Danny\'s fingerprint on the touchphone, wired to it, can disarm it. He tells Danny to pay a visit to Erica, so he can say he\'s sorry. He hangs up. They realize he means Erica\'s tombstone. Danny, Santiago and Aiken get into a car and start for the cemetery. Danny\'s phone rings. It\'s Chuck Jansen, another detective. He tells Danny that something was not making sense. All the numbers in the envelope were of cell phones rigged to the streetcar. Miles also had a camera in the elevator shaft, where Willie died. He had blown the bomb early. Danny realizes that Willie was meant to die. He asks Aiken what he\'s missing. Aiken realizes its about money. He tells Santiago to get all the info about Willie Dumaine. Santiago finds that Willie had a second job as a security guard. They think back to the hotel incident. The gas line had come loose, so they evacuated a few city blocks around it. One of those buildings was the Department of Engraving and Printing - the Mint.\n\nMeanwhile, Miles, dressed as a security guard, uses Willie\'s card to gain entrance to the Mint. He uses a false name to sign in. He follows another security guard as they\'re led to the safe. The money there is over one hundred million dollars. Having killed all the other guards, Miles dumps the money down into the sewer.\n\nAiken tells Santiago to lock down the Mint, while he and Danny go after Molly. As they drive, Danny wonders how Miles will get the money out of the place. Aiken tells him only emergency vehicles can get through. Danny suddenly thinks back to when he hijacked the firetruck. He turns the car around and heads for the Mint.\n\nMiles emerges from the sewer, near the Hotel Monteleone, where the firetruck (which Danny hijacked) is parked. He uses the hose to siphon out the water and money into the truck.\n\nDanny tells Aiken that Molly\'s not at the cemetery. She\'s a nurse and Miles\' ticket out. Aiken calls the hospital security.\n\nAt the hospital, Miles uses an explosion as a diversion and heads into the hospital. Inside, he forces Molly to help him wheel the soaking wet money (inside a bodybag) up to the top of the hospital, to the helipad. He kills two hospital guards in the process. They head for the Medevac chopper. He tells her to take them up.\n\nDanny and Aiken race into the hospital. Molly tries to stall, giving them time to reach the chopper. Miles shoots at them, wounding Aiken. Danny leaps and grabs onto the chopper. He and Miles fight inside the chopper, with Molly using the chopper to help Danny out. However, the engine gets hit by gunfire and the chopper starts to lose control. Miles activates the touchphone-bomb. Danny, though wounded, punches Miles\' lights out, before he and Molly jump out of the chopper into a terrace pool, just as time runs out. Miles gets blown to bits inside the helicopter. Aiken, happily, throws his yellow toy car away.\n\nDanny and Molly slowly and painfully trudge downstairs, while Danny starts to tell Molly about the house while credits roll~',1366,22000000,'US',17280326),(24,'12 Rounds 2: Reloaded','2013-06-01',95,0,'Nick Malloy portrays an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) who finds himself caught in a deadly 12-round game of cat and mouse with a vigilante tied to the paramedic\'s past.

The flash drive was surrendered to the evidence cop. Shaw reads the incident report claiming that Freemont open fire at Burke and his men. The incident report that he reads are all lies. Shaw learns that the flash drive might contain the related incident; he goes to the evidence cop to retrieve it. At the same time, Burke, at his home, receives a call from someone saying that the evidence of George arrived and quickly heads to the precinct. Burke summons his men to meet at the precinct.

As Shaw gets out from the elevator, Burke receives a call from his crew that Shaw has got the evidence, so they quickly finds Shaw in order to retrieve the evidence. After Shaw found that Matthews is not in the office, he realizes that he is being hunted by Burke and his men. Burke then press the fire alarm so that the employees can evacuate the building in order to find Shaw easily. Once the building is evacuated, Darrow takes over security control to monitor Shaw\'s whereabouts and he initiates the total lockdown and disables all the phone communication and networks. Shaw has only 12 rounds left in his gun and makes good use of it.\n\nAll of the people have now evacuated except the Officer Taylor, newly graduated from the academy, has being locked inside despite she is using the card key. Shaw sees Officer Meeks, worked on Burke to find Shaw, then held hostage as Burke appears. Seeing this opportunity, Burke shoots Meeks and Shaw drags his body into the elevator.

However, Darrow notices that the network is activated and he struggles to deactivate it. Unfortunately for Shaw that Darrow successfully deactivated the network just moments before it finishes the upload.

The US know that the attack was sponsored by Al-Qaeda, who has sanctuary in Afghanistan.\n\nAs news of the devastating terrorist attacks that daybreak, Nelson volunteers to lead 595 into Afghanistan. Bowers initially refuses, but veteran soldier CW5 Hal Spencer (Michael Shannon) (a Chief Warrant Officer 5 and ODA 595\'s assistant team leader), previously scheduled to retire, persuades Bowers to give Nelson command of 595 again (Hal takes back his retirement papers & Stands up for Nelson, who has never been in combat and has only led the team in training for 2 years), as well as volunteering himself for the deployment. After leaving their families, 595 travels to Uzbekistan on October 7, 2001. After being briefed and evaluated by COL Mulholland (William Fichtner), Commander of 5th Special Forces Group, Nelson and 595 are picked to fight alongside Northern Alliance leader Abdul Rashid Dostum (Navid Negahban). Their mission is to help Dostum take over Mazar-I-Sharif and put a serious dent in Taliban\'s ability to prop Al-Qaeda. Mulholland gives Nelson 6 weeks, but Nelson retorts that in 3 weeks the harsh winter will shut down all mountain passes. So, they have just 3 weeks. Mulholland is impressed with Nelson\'s smarts and picks his group from the 6 team options available at his command.\n\nBen Milo (Trevante Rhodes), a Sergeant First Class in ODA 595. Sean Coffers (Geoff Stults), member of ODA 595. Vern Michaels (Thad Luckinbill), member of ODA 595. Scott Black (Ben O\'Toole), member of ODA 595. Bill Bennett (Kenny Sheard), a Sergeant First Class in ODA 595. Fred Falls (Austin Stowell), a Staff Sergeant in ODA 595. Pat Essex (Austin Hébert), a Master Sergeant in ODA 595. Charles Jones (Jack Kesy), member of ODA 595. Kevin Jackson (Kenneth Miller), member of ODA 595.\n\nODA 595 is inserted covertly in Afghanistan aboard an MH-47 Chinook flown by 160th SOAR on 19 October 2001 (The Chinook must fly at 25K ft to avoid missiles that can be fired by Taliban forces from mountains that are as high as 10K ft. There is no oxygen on board and the team can go Hypoxic). They land 40 miles south of Mazar-i Sharif, the country\'s fourth-largest city and a long-time stronghold of the Taliban, where they meet Dostum. Their CIA contact informs them that the Northern Alliance is split into 3 militias who are rivals and don\'t coordinate with each other. If they meet in battle, they will forget the Taliban and fight each other instead. Dostum is an Uzbek and was fighting Russian since he was 16. He is 55 now and is now fighting the Taliban.\n\nSix of the 12 members, led by Nelson, leave with Dostum to the mountains (as Dostum had only 6 extra horses), while the other six remain in a fortified camp nicknamed \"The Alamo\" under Spencer\'s command. Dostum is attempting to capture the northern Afghanistan city, while battling Taliban leader Mullah Razzan (Numan Acar), who rules local communities brutally under strict Sharia law (killing women who encourage their girls to study), and has murdered several people, including Dostum\'s family. Although the warlord is initially skeptical of Nelson\'s abilities (Nelson and his team are also suspicious of Dostum as the camps he picks for rest are in a GPS and radio dead zone. Nelson fears Dostum might be setting them up to be sold to the Taliban for bounty), Nelson gradually earns Dostum\'s respect (Nelson gets close to Taliban forces (even face of a firefight) to give exact GPS coordinates to the bombers to drop their loads and cause heavy casualties). In one battle, however, Dostum makes a tactical error (he attacks a heavily fortified Taliban town without US air force support. The bombers were out of fuel and were heading back but Dostum didn\'t bother to check with Nelson before attacking), costing several casualties. Dostum is not willing to put US army soldiers in harm\'s way as if even one of them dies, the US forces leave, and they lose the war against Taliban. Meanwhile Mulholland has doubts about the route Nelson is taking (and also because he can\'t speak to Nelson directly) and decides to introduce a 2nd team to advance on Mazar-I-Sharif.\n\nNelson accuses Dostum of acting carelessly with the lives of his men and of withholding valuable information, while Dostum retorts that he still feels that Nelson, and the U.S. are not willing to pay the potential price (blood) of the conflict and tells Nelson that he needs to use his heart and mind to \"be a warrior\" instead of a soldier. The two eventually reconcile, and, after splitting off a three-man element under SFC Sam Diller (Michael Peña) (ODA 595\'s intelligence Sergeant First Class) to strike a Taliban supply route and being joined by Hal Spencer\'s half of ODA 595, continue to work together. Hal has a slipped disc but continues to carry his own weight. They win several victories with Dostum\'s leadership and manpower and American air-power, making significant progress towards Mazar-i Sharif. When Nelson informs Dostum that another ODA, 555, has been dispatched to support Atta Muhammad, another Northern Alliance leader, who is Dostum\'s political rival, Dostum is furious, and his men promptly abandon 595.\n\nFollowing Dostum\'s departure, Nelson plans to continue operating against the Taliban with his Americans and the few Afghan fighters remaining with them. Encountering a large force of Al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters and armored vehicles, ODA 595, re-joined by Diller and his element, uses air support to eliminate many of the fighters and most of the armor, but are discovered and attacked. Spencer is critically injured by a suicide bomber, and the team is about to be overrun under heavy Taliban and Al-Qaeda pressure when Dostum returns with his forces. Carrying out the U.S. Army\'s first cavalry charge of the 21st century, the American and Northern Alliance forces disperse the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, and Dostum tracks down and kills Razzan. After Spencer is med-evacuated, Nelson and Dostum continue to Mazar-i-Sharif but find Atta Muhammad has beaten them there. Against expectations, Dostum and Muhammad meet peacefully and put aside their differences. Impressed by Nelson and the Americans\' efforts, Dostum gives Nelson his prized riding crop and tells him that he will always consider Nelson a brother and fellow fighter, at the same time bidding him remember that Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires. Spencer ultimately survives, and all 12 soldiers of ODA 595 return home after 23 days of almost continuous fighting in Afghanistan.\n\nThe film\'s penultimate moment shows a photo of the Horse Soldier Statue at the World Trade Center in New York City, based on the soldiers of ODA 595 and their victory in the early stages of the response to the September 11th attacks, dedicated to all United States Special Forces.

As a result, a deadly civil war has broken out which has made Benghazi the most dangerous place on the planet. In 2012, Benghazi, Libya is named one of the most dangerous places in the world, and countries have pulled their embassies out of the country in fear of an attack by militants. The United States, however, still has a diplomatic compound (not an official embassy) open in the city. Less than a mile away is a not-so-secret CIA outpost called \"The Annex\", which is protected by a team of 6 private military contractors from Global Response Staff made up of former military special operations personnel. New to the detail is Jack \"Da\" Silva (John Krasinski), who arrives in Benghazi and is picked up by Tyrone S. \"Rone\" Woods (James Dale), a member of the team and a personal friend of Silva. Arriving at the Annex, Da Silva is introduced to the rest of the team and the chief (David Costabile), who constantly gives the team strict reminders to never engage the citizens to avoid conflict with local militants in the area. The chief also believes that there is no real threat in Libya as he believes the Libyans are thankful to Americans for supporting their revolution. He is not supportive of the armed non-CIA protective detail guarding his compound, as he feels they are a threat to their security.\n\nThe U.S. Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens (Matt Letscher) arrives in Benghazi to maintain diplomatic connections in the middle of the political and social chaos. Despite warnings, Ambassador Stevens decides to stay at the Special Mission with limited protection from a pair of Diplomatic Security (DS) agents and guards hired from the local February 17th Martyrs Brigade militia, nicknamed \"17-Feb\". On the morning of the eleventh anniversary of the September 11 attacks, Stevens notices suspicious men taking pictures of the compound and notifies his security detail. Back at the Annex, the GRS team communicates with their families and Da Silva finds out that his wife is pregnant.\n\nThat night, a group of Islamist militants from Ansar Al-Sharia assault the compound. Unwilling to work as protective guards for $28 a day, the local 17-Feb guards quickly surrender their posts, allowing the attackers easy access to the Special Mission compound. This first attack happens around 9 pm. Scott Wickland (Davd Giuntoli), a Diplomatic Security agent, takes Stevens and an officer, Sean Smith (Christopher Dingli), into the safe room. Unable to breach the safe room, the attackers set the building on fire hoping to burn the men out.\n\nWickland is able to escape but loses both Stevens and Smith. At the Annex, the GRS team desperately wants to go to the compound to help, but the chief refuses, fearing that the GRS team\'s departure would leave the Annex vulnerable. meanwhile the Embassy in Tripoli has no military assets to help the team in Benghazi and the African Command in Germany requires 45 mins and an approval from the white House to respond to this crisis. Refusing to listen, the GRS team dispatches to the compound and meets up with the DS agents. Silva and Woods go into the building to try to find Stevens and Smith, but are only able to find Smith, who has died from smoke inhalation. The team retreats back to the Annex. The team from the compound also follows suit, but after Wickland goes the wrong direction, they are followed back to the Annex. The cars enter the Annex at around 12 am.\n\nKnowing an attack by the militants is imminent, the staff of the CIA Annex make several desperate calls for help. The only help they can get is from Glen \"Bub\" Doherty (Toby Stephens), a Global Response Staff officer based in the US Embassy in Tripoli, who forms a team including two Delta operators that flies to Benghazi after several delays. Meanwhile, the GRS team fends off the militants as they try to breach the Annex perimeter late into the night at around 1 am. As the attackers regroup after failed assaults, the GRS team takes time to regroup as well, and the downtime allows them to think about their families while considering the gravity of the situation. After repelling the largest attack wave, the Annex receives word from ISR that help is in route from Croatia in form a strike package of fighter aircraft & helicopter laden with reinforcements. This is around 3 am.\n\nWith the GRS team compromised, and the Annex now vulnerable, the remaining GRS operators watch as a convoy of vehicles rolls toward the Annex at 5 30 am. Fearing the worst, the operators prepare to make a final stand, until it is revealed that the convoy is an element of the Libya Shield Force militia escorting the GRS reinforcements. They also find out that Stevens was found behind the compound but was pronounced dead at the hospital from smoke inhalation. The militants launch a mortar attack at 6 am that wounds one of the DS agents and kills both Woods and Doherty. But the GRS team is able to withstand the onslaught of the militia and push them back. The promised air support never came. At 6 15 am a huge convoy of 50 vehicles rolls towards the annex. As the team preps for the final stand, they realize that this is the rescue team they have been waiting for all along. The entire annex is evacuated, and the CIA team leaves Benghazi by 8 30 am. The GRS team stays behind for their plane. As the remainder of the team wait at the airstrip with the bodies of Stevens, Smith, Woods and Doherty, they reflect on the events that happened and how they will most likely receive no recognition for defending the Annex as they were off the books. They are finally evacuated at 10 30 am.

When she arrives, she greets her step-father who is working his way through a couple of paperworks. Sarah told her step-father to rest that night while she takes care of her brothers who are at the barn fixing a jeep. Sarah left the house to go to the family\'s barn nearby while a storm is brewing. She saw her brothers with their friends having a party at the barn. Among those partying were Stephen Moore (Peter Gadiot) and his girlfriend Emily (Gemma Atkinson), Charlie Moore (Gabriel Thomson), Gary Ashby (Tom Felton), and Doug Walker (Joshua Bowman). Also in the barn away from the noise of the party is their youngest brother Luke Moore (Anthony de Liseo) asleep amongst the hay together with their dog Stoner. Sarah woke up Luke and learned that their parents were fighting over bills and a supposed love affair of their mother with another man. She told Luke to go back to sleep and sent Stoner back home. Sarah then joined the party where she asked why she was kept out of the loop for so long. Stephen then told her that her step father accused their mother of having an affair with someone and that she is paying this man huge sums of money. Sarah can\'t believe that her mother is having an affair. Everyone went back to the house. There was a power outage caused by the storm. Inside, the pack went up the stairs and noticed blood dripping at the top of the stairs. Meanwhile, Gary separates from the group and ended up in the kitchen in order to look for candles. The group upstairs followed the marks of blood on the carpet and they saw that it came from their father\'s room. When they entered the room, everyone was shocked to see the lifeless body of their father that seemed to have been attacked by some wild animal. The rib cage can clearly be seen with some internal organs missing. Almost at the same time, Gary saw some candles and dropped them. When he reached down to get them, he saw the collar of Stoner and the bloody remains of the dog. The group upstairs suddenly saw a beast like creature which immediately attacked them. Luckily, they were able to close the door before the beast could reach them. The beast keeps on pounding furiously against the closed door when Gary called out to them. The beast immediately heard Gary and went after him and killed him the same way - ripping his internal organs out. The creature then started to go back to the closed door and furiously tried to break it open. Sarah and group then fled to the bathroom of their father\'s room and closed the door there. When the beast started to pound the door of the bathroom also, Sarah saw a passageway inside the bathroom going to the attic. Everyone went up it and for a moment in time they were saved. In the attic, the group contemplated on what they are going to do. Sarah mentioned that they needed to get help and her mobile phone is in her bag downstairs. Stephen\'s phone is dead. Sarah remembered Luke was left sleeping at the barn. Sarah then said that there is a phone in their father\'s room. Emily saw a pathway in the attic that leads to another opening in another room. They devised a plan in order to get to the phone. Sarah would go down through the other pathway and make distract the beast while Charlie goes down to their father\'s bathroom back into their father\'s room and use the phone there to call for help. The monster heard Sarah\'s screams to get it\'s attention and ran towards her. Meanwhile, Charlie was able to reach the phone and he tried calling the police. Sarah went back to the other opening in the attic when she noticed that the creature had stopped following her. She went outside to look for the creature and realized that it is after Charlie. Charlie was able to contact the police and mentioned about the wild animal in their house before he was attacked and killed by the beast. Sarah saw that Charlie was already being devoured by the beast. It then went after Sarah, who immediately tried to go back up the attic. Unfortunately, the beast was able to get hold and bite her leg before she managed to make her way up to the attic. On the other side of town, McRae was picked up by police officer May. Apparently they were sent to investigate the call made by Charlie about wild animals being loose at their home. McRae is a trained dog catcher and was enlisted by the police department to help in resolving the situation. May thinks that the report is a hoax but went there instead to be sure. Back in the attic, Stephen was hysterical while Doug was treating Sarah\'s leg lacerations. Stephen crawled in the attic away from Sarah and Doug while Emily followed him. Stephen saw another passageway from the attic which lead to another room containing a shotgun. Once inside the room, Sarah and Doug warned them that the beast is lurking outside the room and told them to get out. Emily and Stephen manage to block the door after a little bit of struggle. While Emily is looking for shotgun cartridges, Stephen leaves her and crawls back up to the attic. Sarah armed with a stake makes her way down where she injures the beast before it attacks Emily. All of them meet up at the attic where an outraged Emily starts screaming and threatening a scared Stephen. She takes the shotgun and says she will kill the beast herself. The beast manages to surprise Emily where she takes a shot at it but unfortunalety falls and ends up shooting herself which results in her death. Meanwhile, McRae with officer May see an abandoned car in the middle of the road and stop to investigate. They come to the conclusion, after finding that the woman did not take her handbag, that the car broke down but the driver seeking for help never made it back so the call they received earlier may not be a hoax. As they leave, a pile of clothes is shown a few feet away from the car. Luke wakes up and goes back to the house unaware of the situation that is going on. He finds Gary\'s dead body in the hall way. The beast, now aware of his presence, is after him. Sarah eventually falls through the ceiling. As she quickly recovers she helps Luke and all of the remaining survivors make their way to the roof. McRae and officer May arrive at the house but both get killed by the beast. Sarah manages to reach the police vehicle where she takes the handbag and then all of them run towards the barn where Stephen tries to fix the Jeep. Sarah discovers that the handbag belonged to her mother, it is also revealed that Stephen tampered with his mother\'s car so that he can delay her from seeing her lover. Sarah says that if their mother is dead then Stephen is the one to blame. An upset Stephen knocks her unconscious but Sarah awakens and hits Stephen. A scared Stephen runs out of the barn and he is attacked by the beast. Inside the barn Sarah starts to transforms into a monstrous figure. Luke and Doug run back to the house where the beast comes back. They hide under the table and just as soon as the beast is about to kill them, a beast-like Sarah attacks and fights with the other beast. Luke runs back to the car while Doug tries to shoot at the beast but is eventually bitten and killed by Sarah. In the morning Sarah has returned to her human self.

The Germans have feigned retreat to the Hindenburg Line (it is 3 miles deep, artillery, defenses and fortifications never seen before) and are prepared to ambush the battalion of 1,600 men, Blake\'s brother Lieutenant Joseph Blake (Richard Madden) among them. Erinmore has aerial photos that show the German fortifications which will destroy the advance of the Devonshire Regiment, who aims to attack at dawn the following morning. As all phone lines are cut there is no other way to get the message across.\n\nSchofield wants to wait till dark, but Blake wants to save his brother and leaves immediately.

She treats his wounds, and he gives her his canned food and milk from the farm. Despite her pleas, Schofield leaves, after hearing the chimes of a nearby clock and realizing that time is running out.

It was a time when many Indians were either working for the British or rallying in underground meetings and protests against them. General Douglas (Brian Glover) is a brutal office in charge of a province who is ganging revolutionaries by their thousands. In this atmosphere, Naren Singh (Anil Kapoor) falls in love with Rajeshwari \"Rajjo\" Pathak (Manisha Koirala). Their romance is shown developing in spite of the political and social unrest at the time. Raghuvir Pathak (Anupam Kher) (Rajjo\'s father) wants to assassinate Douglas and knows that he is going visit Kasauni for a brief visit, prior to his departure from India. Pathak decides to relocate to Kasauni so he can work on his plan.\n\nNaren\'s father Diwan Hari Singh (Manohar Singh) is a loyal British employee in Kasauni, & his mother is Gayatri Devi (Sushma Seth), while Raghuvir Pathak is a revolutionary fighting against British rule. Pathak\'s associates include Ashutosh (Ashish Vidyarthi), Govind and Shubhankar (Jackie Shroff). Govind is an insider as he is a manager of Hari Singh\'s estate. Munna (Raghuvir Yadav) is the driver. Abid Ali Baig (Pran) is Raghuvir\'s mentor and a respected revolutionary. Abid is organizing a play in Douglas\'s honor and gives Raghuvir the material to make a bomb, that will be used to kill him.\n\nMajor Bisht (Danny Dengzongpa) is a strict Police officer in Kasauni and a British loyal and is in charge of Douglas\'s security in Kasauli. Naren first sees Rajjo when she arrives in Kasauni with her dad Raghuvir. Naren admits his love to Munna and finally finds Rajjo in the same colony where Munna lives. Munna finds that Rajjo loves to read and spends time in the town library, where Naren goes to woo her. Baig recruits Naren, Rajjo and Bisht\'s daughter Chanda (Chandni) to help with the play being organized in Douglas\'s honor. Eventually Rajjo falls in love with Naren. Raghuvir and Govind prepare 3 bombs. Raghuvir is staying in Govind\'s basement. Bisht has info from police HQ that an attack is planned on Douglas. Chanda meanwhile finds out that Naren has the hots for Rajjo and is heartbroken as she secretly loved Naren herself.\n\nAshutosh arrives in Kasauli to help Raghuvir but is shot by Bisht. He survives and reaches Raghuvir. Rajjo realizes that Raghuvir is a revolutionary. Ashutosh dies in Raghuvir\'s arms. Rajjo tells Naren the truth and asks him to stay away from her. When Naren asks Raghuvir for Rajjo\'s hand in marriage, Raghuvir becomes livid. Naren declares that he is willing to sacrifice everything for Rajjo and convinces Raghuvir of his love for her. Pathak relents and tells Naren to talk to his father. When Naren does so, Hari is angry that his son has chosen Rajjo, the daughter of a revolutionary, but pretends that he will do anything for Naren\'s happiness.\n\nHari eventually tricks Naren into revealing Pathak\'s secret location and leaks the information to the Bisht. Soon, police barge into Pathak\'s hideaway and try to kill him, only to find him waiting to light a bomb, killing both himself and the men. Rajjo, realizes what has happened (she thinks Naren betrayed her and her father) and runs away. She is taken into refuge by Shubhankar, a compatriot of Pathak who has learned of his death. Under Shubhankar\'s tutelage, Rajjo follows her father\'s revolutionary path. Meanwhile, Naren is angry with his father for using him as a pawn in the ambush and killing of Pathak and driving Rajjo away. Hari Singh is rewarded by the British for this act of treachery. Promising to make up with Rajjo and help her cause, Naren pledges to become a protester or a revolutionary.\n\nGovind is tortured to reveal other accomplices, while Abid Ali takes the remaining 2 bombs made by Raghuvir from Govind\'s basement. Naren sees this. He begs Abid Ali to reunite him with Rajjo, but he refuses. Naren follows Abid and finds his passing a package to a girl, who turns out to be Rajjo. Naren follows her, not knowing that police were following him. Only timely intervention by Shubhankar saves them both. Bisth circles the entire area and forces Naren to identify the revolutionaries. But Naren says that Shubhankar & Rajjo are not one of them. Unfortunately, the bombs are confiscated by Bisht.\n\nDuring his visit Douglas kills Govind and then kills Munna when he tries to protest. Naren is aghast at this brutality. Chanda tells Bisht that she will join the protests against Dougles the next day. Bisht orders the arrest of Abid Ali, but Shubhankar kills the policemen sent for the arrest. Abid Ali, Shubhankar and Rajjo decide to leave town, but Bisht sees them, so Abid Ali sacrifices himself to save the others. Naren sees this and promises Abid Ali that Shubhankar will have a pistol the next day, in front of Douglas.\n\nNaren severs all ties with his father (he steals Hari\'s pistol) and stands up against British rule, in front of the city. As he tries to hand over the pistol to Shubhankar, Hari reports the theft to Bisht, who arrests Naren. The attack on Douglas is foiled. Naren is convicted and sentenced to hang for attempted murder.\n\nMoved by Naren\'s actions, Rajjo tells Shubhankar about him. Shubhankar saves Naren from being hanged and the two finish off Hari and many of the British loyalists. They are helped by Major Bisht (Danny Dengzongpa), who has a change of heart after having witnessed the killing of his daughter Chanda (Chandni), a revolutionary, by the gunshots of British loyalists upon General Douglas\' orders (Douglas asked troops to open fire on the gathered crowd as Shubhankar proceeded towards his direction to save Naren).\n\nWith the loyalists dead, Shubhankar hangs General Douglas by the same noose that was intended for Naren.

He assigns each place to a footstep of a child and selects the last footstep which corresponds to Goa. The woman at the counter informs Sameera. She travels to Goa and confuses him a few times. He suspects danger to her life when a few mishaps occur. She admits that she wanted to prove that he imagines other people too apart from the three killers so that he can be treated. She tells her boss that she tried to expose that Antonio\'s company seeds were contaminated with Hydrogen cyanide. She also tells him that the NGO member who was killed had informed her about his meeting with Antonio.\n\nHe reveals that Antonio said they would be spared if the news is not telecast.

Vijay Kumar (Adil Hussain), the Home Minister, unofficially gives Vaseegaran permission to rebuild Chitti. Chitti traces the mobile phones. Vaseegaran then learns from Chitti that the eagle bird (made by the cell phones) is powered by the aura of a human being, which exudes negative energy. The radiation from the antennae of such signal transmitters and auras of other living organisms are positively charged while those of the dead are negatively charged, allowing the parabolic transmitters to repel the bird. Had it entered the electromagnetic field produced by the transmitters, the radiation from the antennae would neutralize the bird, preventing it from reassembling. Vaseegaran replicates a smaller version of those transmitters to destroy the bird. During neutralization, Vaseegaran learns that the negative aura is from Pakshi Rajan (Akshay Kumar).\n\nPakshi Rajan used to be an ornithologist who owned the now abandoned house where birds would come and live with him. Gradually, high-frequency radiation from the newly set up cell towers starts killing the birds due to the rapid growth of mobile phone industries. Pakshi then visits Jayanth Kumar, Manoj Lulla, and the telecommunications minister in order to request them to stop their unjust and unlawful activities but it is in vain. He also organizes conferences and protests against the exorbitant use of cell phones but receives no support.

The aura enters Vaseegaran, enabling Pakshi Rajan to possess his body and attack humans who still possess cell phones. Chitti hesitates to kill him, as it would mean killing Vaseegaran too. Taking advantage of this, Pakshi disassembles Chitti. Vaseegaran takes control of his body long enough to instruct Nila to activate protocol 2.0 for Chitti.\n\nNila takes Chitti back to the lab and rebuilds its body, replacing its microchip with the red chip created by Bohra, which results in Chitti\'s violent configuration, version 2.0, being in control. Nila constrains it from harming anyone but Pakshi Rajan. Chitti then creates more versions of its likeness. Meanwhile, Pakshi takes over a crowded football stadium and exposes Dhinendra to radiation from the nearby cell towers, incinerating and killing him. Chitti, along with its army of robots, arrives and confronts him, resulting in a battle between the two. However, Chitti battery drains, and it rushes to the nearest power station.\n\nDuring this time, micro-bots resembling Chitti, called Kutti version 3.0, arrive mounted on white pigeons and confront Pakshi Rajan, who cannot kill the spectators now as it would mean that the pigeons would also get killed. At one point Pakshi\'s aura leaves Vaseegaran\'s body. The micro-bots then lead his aura to the signal transmission site, where Pakshi Rajan is eliminated.

Ahab is as determined as ever to settle the score and take down the mighty sea mammal that maimed him.','wikipedia:\n\nThe film begins in November 20, 1969, 50 miles off Soviet waters. When the USS Acushnet dives under the ice, a young Ahab (Jay Gillespie) listens for enemy subs when suddenly he detects an unknown target. When the captain listens, he hears nothing, but Ahab insists in the presence of an emptiness. The target dives into a trench, but the captain abandons his search in favor of photographing the target. The target attacks the submarine as Ahab hears a roar. The sub is brought to the icy surface, and the target identifies itself as a gigantic, white, whale-like creature. Ahab survives, but loses his leg to the beast when it hauls the other half of the sub back underwater.\n\nIn the present day, Dr. Michelle Herman (Renée O\'Connor) and her assistant Pip (Derrick Scott) test a whale song generator when the USS Pequod surfaces behind them and Lieutenant Commander Starbuck (Adam Grimes), the executive officer, persuades them to come aboard. In the sub, Starbuck tells them about several attacks in which eyewitnesses all report seeing an enormous whale. Although Michelle explains that the whale song generator needs a recorded whale vocalization, Captain Ahab (Barry Bostwick) comes to the deck and gives her the recording he took of Moby Dick back in 1969. Although Michelle disagrees on joining a Navy sub with the intent of killing an animal, she has no choice.\n\nIn San Diego, Captain Boomer (Matt Lagan) (another survivor of the attack of \'69) is told by his superiors of suspicious activity revolving around the Pequod. He is assigned to investigate, and thanks to a survivor from a recent attack by the White Whale, he comes to the conclusion that Ahab is on the hunt for Moby Dick.\n\nMeanwhile, the USS Essex is searching for the Pequod off Hawaii. When they go to active sonar, it attracts the attention of the wandering Moby Dick. The Essex engages at what appears to be the sub they were searching for, but realizes too late that their adversary is biological just before the sub is destroyed by a torpedo it shot. Later the Pequod comes to their location with no sign of the whale, but encounter the corpses of Essex crew. Rousing his crew with a speech, Ahab moves on to search for the beast.\n\nA helicopter in search of the Pequod encounters it while the sub is following a 600-foot target. As the helicopter engages them, the sub fires a nuke at the unknown target, but the confused helicopter crew tell them they shot a school of giant squid just before they are swallowed alive by Moby Dick.\n\nThe whale then attacks the S.S. Rachel, a cruise liner, when the Pequod intervenes with Michelle\'s whalesong generator. This, although, causes the whale to attack them, subsequently destroying a fin on the Pequod. The sub fires a harpoon made from the Acushnet\'s hull on top of Moby Dick\'s eye, which forces him to dive deeper, dragging the Pequod with it. As the water pressure begins to damage the hull, the line snaps and Starbuck forces the ship to surface.\n\nMoby Dick surfaces too, and the Pequod, along with the help of Boomer in a helicopter, forces the whale into an atoll. The sub gets trapped in shallow water, and three boats are sent out to face the whale with guns and Ahab\'s harpoon. Moby Dick destroys two of the boats and forces the survivors onto the island\'s shores. The whale attacks them again, resulting in the death of Queequeg (Michael Teh). Ahab takes the last boat and fires his harpoon at the whale\'s other eye. Moby Dick destroys the boat, killing Ahab. The remaining crew of the Pequod, including Starbuck, and Pip, follow Ahab\'s orders and fire nukes at the island. Moby Dick dodges the nukes and crushes the Pequod just as the island explodes. The film ends with the White Whale surviving to wreak havoc another day, and with Michelle swimming to the surface just as a rescue helicopter arrives. ---Wikipedia',3021,500000,'US',0),(59,'2012','2009-10-10',158,0,'Dr. Adrian Helmsley, part of a worldwide geophysical team investigating the effect on the earth of radiation from unprecedented solar storms, learns that the earth\'s core is heating up.

Feeling like the police contract is what will get them out of their financial bind, Ben, on the recommendation of his best friend from high school Sean who also works as a tow truck driver for Jackrabbit, gets the money from a loan shark, Ray (Aidan Devine), who works in his day job as a police constable. Ray loans Ben $5000 but Ben must repay $750 per week until $6000 is paid. When Ben returns to his job, a woman drives her vehicle off the tow and flies Ben the finger The following week, Ben is late on his first payment to Ray. Ray begins to charge him additional interest. Sean shows Zach the emergency scanners in his truck. Zach calls the chasers pigs because he has been taught the chaser are unscrupulous. Sean offers to help Avery out. He seems to have an interest in Avery and a desire to belittle high school hockey star Ben. When Ben gets his paycheck for the week, he is behind on his truck, so the company has deducted his payment due for his truck lease from his paycheck. The financial windfall from the police contract does not materialize quickly. Ray stops by Avery\'s diner and tells her to call her husband. Ray demands that Avery tell her husband that Ray really wants his money. Zach goes another week without fighting and is well on his way to earning the promise bicycle. Ben asks his boss for an advance and is soundingly rejected. Ray meets Ben outside the office and slams Ben\'s wrist in the truck door breaking his wrist. Arriving home, Ben finds Sean there eating potato soup. Ben agrees to loan the couple the money and makes advances on Avery. Ben, in a cast, tells Avery if she takes a dime from Sean, they are done as a couple. Ben, who generally operates on morals, decides to try to break-into the cutthroat but more lucrative world of the chasers - tow truck drivers who monitor the police frequency for accident scenes. Chasers generally have no morals. Ray heists Sean\'s scanners from his rig and joins the chasers for the night of work. He alerts Wayne he is working on his turf short term. Elvis pulls up shortly after. An emergency call sends all three drivers into a high-speed chase. Ben stops to help a homeless woman who crossed the street in from of him and is beaten to the accident site. One job Ben is able to find is to haul a car containing a transvestite prostitute and his client who has a kink earning $100. Elvis brags to Wayne his new tires on his rig are like a sexual experience. Ray picks up son from the sitters and learns Zach invited Kamal who bullies him to his birthday party the next day in order to be friends. Ben is proud. Avery is angry when Ben picks her up at the diner. She states that Ben is acting crazy trying to keep his promise to his kid. Another emergency call has Ben, Wayne and Elvis again racing to the accident site. Ray\'s first instinct is to help the accident victim that was on the street. Then realize he needs to sell his service which he does with kindness and integrity which costs Elvis a fare. When Ben gets the car to Kaleb\'s (Wole Daramola) body shop, Kaleb doesn\'t pay Ben the kickback he expects. Kaleb suggests taking the woman who owns the car to a physio clinic who also pays points to tow truck drivers. Elvis arrives and beats Ben and takes his $200 plus $20 for his time and gas as Wayne watches. Ben meets with Ray to negotiate for more time. He witnesses Ray severely injure a man who wasn\'t good for the money he borrowed. Ben comes to realize that not only his own life, but that of Avery and Zach are at risk. Avery meets Sean in his car. Sean has picked up some party supplies and gives Avery money to get Ray off his back. Sean makes moves on Avery that she initially fights off. Sean persists by bringing up the money he will loan her and not request repayment. Ben is at home when Avery arrives and tells her they need to jump on a bus and head out west. Avery says she will not comply. When Ben asks if she will stay for Sean, she admits she could have solved their problems by sleeping with Sean but she could not. Avery suggests she could go home with Zach to her mother\'s house but Ben would not be welcome. Zach overhears and is troubled. Then sees his father has been in a fight and calls Ben a liar. Now highly motivated, Ben drives some nails in a table leg and hits the road. He travels to where Wayne and Elvis are parked. With the spikes, he punctures Elvis\'s tires on his rig and sprays an aerosol in Elvis\'s eyes when Elvis approaches to get revenge. An accident report is broadcast over the scanner and Ben races Wayne to the site. Ben gets the lead in the race when Wayne\'s truck is suddenly t-boned by a taxi cab. One of the cab passengers runs away. In his truck cab, Wayne is near death. Ben dials 911 on his phone, leaves it on the dashboard, but then takes off to the other accident site. He takes a high prices sports car to Kaleb who pays him a large kickback on repairs. Leaving the body shop, Ben calls Binnie\'s wife, Rhonda (Sonya Côté). She agrees to sign off on his truck title and he takes her to a place where Binnie is having an affair. Ben meets Ray at dawn and pays off his loan. Ray tells Ben that the passenger of the taxi saw a Jackrabbit truck at the accident. Ben offers Ray a chance to be his partner in a shop and a restaurant. Ben then enters Binnie\'s office. Binnie tells Ray that he ruined his family and he should get off his lot. Ray says he is staying on with the company as his chaser in his own truck. Outside Ray is roughing up Sean. Ray picks up the bike Zach wants and brings it to Zach\'s birthday party. Ben sits down by Avery and tells her he paid for the bike. When she asks how, another accident call echoes on the tow trucks scanner.',953,0,'US',0),(78,'22 Jump Street','2014-06-05',112,0,'After making their way through high school (twice), big changes are in store for officers Schmidt and Jenko when they go deep undercover at a local college. But when Jenko meets a kindred spirit on the football team, and Schmidt infiltrates the bohemian art major scene, they begin to question their partnership. Now they don\'t have to just crack the case - they have to figure out if they can have a mature relationship. If these two overgrown adolescents can grow from freshmen into real men, college might be the best thing that ever happened to them.','Following their success in the 21 Jump Street program, Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are back on the streets chasing narcotics. However, after failing in the pursuit of a group of drug dealers led by Ghost (Peter Stormare), Deputy Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) puts the duo back on the program to work for Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) - now located across the street at 22 Jump Street. Their assignment is to go undercover as college students and locate the supplier of a drug known as \"WHYPHY\" (WiFi) that killed a student photographed buying it on campus.\n\nAt college, Jenko quickly makes friends with a pair of jocks named Zook (Wyatt Russell) and Rooster (Jimmy Tatro), the latter being a prime suspect of the investigation. Jenko starts attending parties with the jocks who do not take as kindly to Schmidt. Meanwhile, Schmidt gets the attention of an art student, Maya (Amber Stevens), by feigning an interest in slam poetry. The two sleep together, to the disapproval of Maya\'s roommate Mercedes (Jillian Bell), and it is revealed that Maya is the daughter of the vehemently disapproving Captain Dickson. Despite sleeping together, Maya tells Schmidt not to take it seriously, and he starts to feel left out as Jenko bonds more and more with Zook who encourages him to join the football team.\n\nSchmidt and Jenko visit Mr. Walters (Rob Riggle) and Eric (Dave Franco) in jail for advice on how to look for the WHYPHY supplier. Walters notices a unique tattoo on the arm of the dealer in the photograph and insists that if they find the tattoo, they will have found their man. Whilst hanging out with Zook and Rooster, Jenko notices that Rooster does not have the tattoo but sees it on Zook\'s arm. Schmidt and Jenko are invited to join the fraternity led by the jocks but Schmidt refuses, furthering the tension between the two. At a counselling session, they realise that perhaps Zook was buying the drugs rather than selling them, and soon after find Ghost and his men on campus. A chase ensues and Ghost again evades the pair. Jenko reveals to Schmidt that he\'s been offered a football scholarship with Zook and is unsure whether or not he wants to continue to be a police officer. Schmidt decides for him by telling officers on the scene that Jenko had nothing to do with the melee caused by the chase. Immediately afterwards, Schmidt moves out of the dorm and Maya finds out who he really is.\n\nSpring Break arrives and Schmidt prepares to go after Ghost alone. Jenko asks to help so that the two can have one final mission together, and the pair head to the beach where Ghost is likely to be dealing WHYPHY. Inside a bar, they find Mercedes, revealed to be Ghost\'s daughter, giving instructions to other dealers. The pair, backed up by Dickson, ambush the meeting and give chase as they flee. Mercedes is able to handcuff Dickson and take him hostage, pursued by Schmidt. Meanwhile, Jenko goes after Ghost. After a fist fight with Mercedes, Schmidt is held at gunpoint by her but Maya sneaks up and knocks her out. Schmidt goes to help Jenko who is now on the roof of the college in pursuit of Ghost, who shoots Jenko in the shoulder. Ghost attempts to escape in a helicopter and Jenko jumps across to it but struggles to hold on with his injured arm. Schmidt makes the same jump and the two fall into the sea, but not before Jenko is able to throw a grenade into the helicopter, killing Ghost.\n\nBack on land, Jenko tells Schmidt that he still wants to be a police officer as he believes their differences help their partnership, and the two reconcile in front of a cheering crowd.

Though he initially refuses, claiming he\'s retired, the money convinces him. He travels to Hong Kong and meets Lin\'s son, from whom he steals his cell phone and determines Lin\'s location. He meets her at the airport and seduces her. The next morning, he gets Keith\'s location from her phone but chooses not to kill her; she realizes he is an agent and kills him.\n\nTravis\' agency, Red Mountain, bring him back to life using an experimental procedure.

A man reports to his colonel that he has five boy soldiers. At the training camp, boys no older than 14 practice shooting with automatic weapons. They swig from presumably laced bottles, woozy and pliant. Colonel Dubaku gives the boys a pep talk about exterminating cockroaches (i.e. dissenters) and puts a machete in a stoned boy\'s hands.

The scarf is from India, Jack was going to give it to his daughter some day. He got it there last summer. He tells Willie he can keep the scarf, but Jack\'s gonna need his knife back.\n\nCarl Benton comes to talk to Jack with the stuffed shirt, Frank Trammell, the ambassador\'s chief political officer. Jack knows who he is, he got his messages. Frank tells him the senate subcommittee has questions about the torture and questioning of prisoners in Jack\'s custody and tries to serve him. Jack says if they want him, they can come get him. Trammell tells Benton that Jack\'s been ducking the subpoena for more than a year across three continents. Frank tells Benton it\'d be a shame for his funding for the boys school to dry up because of Jack.\n\nJack unloads stuff from the supply truck as a Frenchman generally irritates him.\n\n3:10 The rebels have more guns than soldiers to carry them. An underling promises Dubaku he\'ll have his \"little soldiers.\" Dubaku gets a satellite phone call from Jonas Hodges, your standard issue \"24\" bad guy in a suit, offering more soldiers if he needs them. Hodges provided the weapons. He wants General Juma to call him later. Hodges, back in D.C., tells a businessman he doesn\'t want the transactions traceable by anyone and to deal with it. On the trading floor a broker named Chris tries to smooth talk a client. He reaches in his drawer for a pill and pops it. Chris is summoned by his boss and passes Hodges on his way into the office. His boss tells him to burn some records.\n\nBenton talks to Jack, telling him he should look at the subpoena. Jack tells Benton not to worry, he\'ll be gone by dark. He tells Benton all he has left is his freedom, and he won\'t let them take that away from him. We learn Jack called him after 10 years, they\'re old special ops buddies, and Benton has found a way to live with himself, but first he had to stop running. Benton tells him again Jack\'s welcome to stay. But Jack says they both know it\'d be better if he left.\n\nThe Frenchman with the supply truck argues with a man saying that nothing is wrong and that Juma isn\'t stealing children.

There\'s an impending coup in Sangala. On a conference call, President Daniels talks to Sangala\'s prime minister. Lennox tells him Taylor wants to weigh in. Daniels greets her, pointedly calling her \"Senator\" Taylor. She wants to know how Juma could raise an army without them knowing about it. She thinks they need a show of force, but Daniels thinks it isn\'t their fight. He ordered the ambassador to begin evacuating all non-military U.S. nationals. She thinks that sends the wrong message.\n\n3:33 Benton finds the deflated soccer ball. He sees a buzzard picking at something in the trees. It\'s one of the boys. Ew. He calls for Desmond and sees him slumped by a stream. He\'s alive.\n\nAt the school, Willie tries to convince Jack to take him and Desmond with him. Willie says there are too many ghosts around, but Jack asks him to stay and help take care of the other boys.\n\nJack walks away.\n\n3:37\n\nThomas runs after him. Benton\'s on the phone.

He yells at the boys to get in the shelter The Frenchman still doesn\'t believe anything is wrong and says the U.N. remains neutral. \"Why don\'t you go hide in the shelter with the other children?\" Jack snarls. Take that, surrender monkey. Jack finds Benton\'s guns and dynamite as the boys hide under a school room. Trucks of men with automatic weapons drive up. Jack starts lobbing dynamite and distracts them. He takes out a few then runs for cover. It\'s at least a dozen to one, just how Jack likes it. They have serious hardware, including a bazooka. A man creeps around the corner of a building right into Jack\'s knife. He takes his automatic weapon. The boys keep quiet, hiding. Jack gets two rebels to follow him into the nearby woods and it\'s hand to hand combat time. Jack\'s doing pretty well until a third guy shows up and whacks him with a gun butt. But the man in charge says to hold off on killing him until he tells them where the children are. Benton drives nearby with a wounded Desmond in the vehicle.\n\nHe checks out the scene and finds the rebels stringing Jack up.\n\n3:49\n\nA helicopter takes off from the embassy as people try to gain entry. But Trammell\'s only letting in U.S citizens. A woman with a baby pleads with him, but even when she offers to do anything he wants, he coldly says he can\'t.

Trammell says if Benton wants to get the 14 boys out, they have to get to him at the embassy. The last chopper leaves in an hour.\n\nThe rebels beat on Jack, who, of course, isn\'t talking. The head guy removes a machete from the fire and singes Jack\'s ear. The children hear him scream.\n\nJack looks up to see Benton flashing a mirror at him in the distance. The next time the man threatens him, Jack begs, un-Jack-like, to spare him and says he\'ll show him where the kids are. He describes an underground shelter right where Benton is waiting. Jack faux-sobs. Two men investigate and Benton takes care of them. Jack grabs his torturer by the neck using his legs, and snaps it, killing him. Benton comes to untie him. He has sponsorship papers for the kids and needs to get them to the embassy, Benton tells him. They get the kids and load them onto the bus. The Frenchman U.N. guy refuses to provide an escort and goes off on his own.\n\nJack has one of the rebel\'s walkie talkies. He says he\'s going with Carl, who assures Jack that he won\'t have to go anywhere near the embassy.\n\n4:00 The secret service searches Chris at Roger\'s house. A couple months ago his boss, Nickles, called Chris into his office and wanted him to manage a special project, for which he got paid a ton. But he had to keep his mouth shut. He thought he was \"only\" helping his boss embezzle money from his own firm. But he recognized one of the account prefixes. The account holder was on the terrorist watch list. He tells Roger about the creepy guy that morning. Roger tells him he should go to the FBI, but Chris wants to take it to Roger\'s mom. Chris says he saved some records Nickles told him to destroy. They\'re on his hard drive at home. Roger says he\'s not doing anything until he sees the records from himself. Chris tells him to check his e-mail in an hour.\n\nGeneral Juma arrives at the base camp. They have Howitzers positioned to hit any target in the city.\n\nDubaku gets a call from someone. They\'ve caught the Frenchman, who says that Dubaku\'s brother is dead and he has info on where the boys are.

Desmond is developing a fever.\n\n4:12 Daniels hands over protocols to Taylor. She\'s ready to go, but Daniels offers her a drink. She declines but he has one anyway. He toasts her administration and when she says simply \"thank you,\" he corrects her, \"thank you, Mr. President.\" In the hallway, she complains to her husband that Daniels ordered an evacuation without consulting her. She thinks there might be a reason he made the order that he\'s hiding.\n\nDubaku wants revenge for his brother\'s death, but Juma wants him to focus on the coup. Dubaku says he just needs an hour.\n\n4:22 Chris arrives home. He starts to copy the data from his computer. He contemplates popping a pill but thinks better of it. He hears a noise in his apartment and goes to investigate. When he returns to his computer, he finds a man there. There\'s a gun on the desk now. The man asks if the files are everything. He\'s there to recover them. Another man comes up behind him and whacks him with a newspaper. The first man says Chris is going to tell them everything he knows and they\'ll know if he\'s lying. Duct tape is involved.\n\nIn the car, Roger\'s girlfriend harasses him to tell her what Chris\'s visit was all about. But he says he gave his word to keep it private. Edward, the driver and secret service agent who frisked Chris, announces they\'ve arrived.\n\nEdwards gets a call. The man in Chris apartment tells him they managed to recover the files but they\'re working to determine their exposure now. The second man injects Chris with something.\n\n4:31 Jack, Benton and the boys cross a field and Benton tells Jack to follow the river to get out of there while they follow a safe road into town. They say good-bye and Jack walks off, again. Just then there\'s a noise in the distance. They\'re standing in an open field, exposed, when a helicopter comes around the corner. They run for the trees as the helicopter, with Dubaku inside, fires on them. He orders the pilot to land. The kids hurry through the woods. Willie stops, realizing he dropped the scarf Jack gave him. He runs to get it from the brush where it fell. Benton watches Willie and sees his foot step between two land mines. Benton rushes to keep him from triggering one, pushing him aside. In the process, Benton ends up standing directly on top of it, arming it. Jack inspects it, but Benton knows the make and model. It can\'t be disabled. Benton tells Jack there isn\'t enough time. He asks Jack to take the kids to the embassy. He gives Jack their sponsorship papers. He says he\'ll try to buy them some time. Benton tells the kids to go with Jack, nobly saying he\'ll be right behind them. Jack and Benton exchange knowing man nods.\n\n4:38 Dubaku and his men look for the children in the woods. Benton covers up the land mine and raises his rifle over his head. The four or five men and Dubaku approach him, guns drawn. When Benton won\'t tell Dubaku where Jack is, Dubaku shoots him in the arm. Then the other arm. Benton struggles to stay balanced on the land mine. He mutters where they are and Dubaku steps closer to hear. Benton looks at Dubaku and tells him to go to hell.\n\nJack hears a large blast in the distance and pauses for a minute, having lost another friend.\n\n4:46 In the city, Jack and Thomas guide the kids to the embassy. Jack tells Thomas he\'s going to give him the papers. When Willie figures out that Benton is dead he runs off, crying. Jack runs after him, telling him Mr. Benton died to make sure he\'d be safe. He tells him he\'s sorry as he gives him a hug. They hurry, rushing to make the chopper. Jack notices something amiss in the street and tells Thomas to hide with the boys behind a truck. He homes in on a man walking suspiciously through the crowd, as the man opens his coat to reveal a weapon, Jack shoots him dead. Men begin firing from the rooftops and a street full of people hit the deck. The coup is on.\n\nJack turns to find the young drugged boy who killed the \"cockroach\" in the opening aiming an automatic weapon at him. Jack tries to talk to him, telling him he can come with them out of the country if he puts his gun down. He promises no one will hurt him. The boy throws down his gun and runs away. Benton\'s boys hold hands, then weave through the crowd.\n\nAt the inauguration, Roger checks his phone, looking for the files from Chris. His mother arrives. As Taylor greets her son, Edward and Hodges confer off to the side. Edwards tells Hodges they don\'t need to worry about Roger, that he has no evidence and he\'ll think his strung-out friend told him something crazy. Hodges tells Edward to keep an eye on Roger.\n\n4:52 Chaos reigns at the embassy as desperate citizens try to find sanctuary. Jack pushes his way to the front of the crowd, telling the guard that Trammell is expecting him. The boys wait in the crush of people, Desmond fading fast. Trammell arrives and Jack, through the gate, tells him Benton is dead, but he has their paperwork. Trammell tells him there\'s a problem: they need the legal guardianship of a U.S. citizen. If Jack surrenders himself, Trammell will waive the requirement. Trammell says whatever happens to them will be on Jack. \"I don\'t have a choice you son of a bitch, open the gate,\" Jack growls. . Trammell makes Jack go in first, keeping the boys on the other side. Once through, Jack is immediately handcuffed while the guard blocks the boys at the gate. As Jack screams for the boys to be let in, Trammell finally relents. They boys are safe inside as Jack is led away by guards.\n\nAllison Taylor takes the oath of office Hundreds of desperate people are left on the other side of the embassy gates. Taylor gives her speech over scenes of boys testing automatic weapons in Sangala, the two goons covering Chris\'s body in concrete and Jack being flown away on the helicopter. Taylor speaks of apathy, greed and fear threatening freedom.\n\nThe helicopter takes off at the embassy as the screaming citizens are finally let inside, only to see the last form of transport depart. Willie reassuringly puts his hand on Jack\'s shoulder.\n\n5:00\n\nScenes from Season 7: Jack testifies at the senate subcommittee, being grilled about torture and saying he doesn\'t regret his decisions.

Ethan starts getting weak and groggy until he catches up to The Albino. He falls to the ground before shooting The Albino in the foot. He limps away as Ethan loses consciousness.\n\nEthan wakes up in the hospital to a doctor who tells him that he has cancer and it\'s spread to his lungs. He gives Ethan about 3-5 months to live.\n\nEthan returns to his apartment to find that there\'s a family living there. The patriarch, Jules (Eriq Ebouaney), warmly welcomes Ethan back, telling him they are refugees seeking a new place to live. He goes to complain about it, but is told that if he forces the family out, he can get arrested. Ethan goes back and takes out his gun in front of Jules, but then relents and says he can stay until his eldest daughter gives birth to her child.\n\nEthan calls his ex-wife Tina (Connie Nielsen) as she\'s meeting up with friends. She is hesitant to meet with him until he says it\'s urgent that they get together. They go together to sign his will and he tells her that he is dying and he doesn\'t want Zooey to know. He wants to meet up with her, and Tina tells him only on the condition that he is officially done working for \"them\". Ethan says yes.\n\nThe two of them go meet Zooey at her school. Her reunion with her father is awkward and she seems less than interested in talking to him. A handsome older boy comes over to Zooey, and she introduces him as Hugh (Jonas Bloquet). He is polite to Ethan when she introduces them, though he is understandably on the fence about it. Hugh leaves and Ethan presents Zooey with a purple bike, thinking that is still her favorite color. She opts to take the metro with her friends, leaving Ethan to ride the bike himself.\n\nEthan stops at a stand and is met by Vivi. She drops Zooey\'s name and shows him his watch that he left by the hotel. She gets him to ride with her, telling him to work for her. He refuses until she says she has an experimental drug that can save his life. Ethan reconsiders, and Vivi tells him the job is to find The Wolf and kill him.\n\nVivi takes Ethan to a hotel to find a man that can give them the whereabouts of The Albino\'s accountant. She tells Ethan there\'s only one guy in there, but after he busts into the room of their target, he finds five guys. He and Vivi end up killing all of them when nobody gives them any info. In the elevator, Ethan tells her he will only continue the assignment if he is given 50 grand and a $1 million life insurance policy. She complies and gives him a shot of the drug.\n\nWe see The Albino meeting up with a man. He gives this man a photo of Ethan to keep on him.\n\nEthan goes to Zooey and Tina\'s apartment and hears Zooey scream. Thinking she\'s in danger, he breaks the doorknob and busts in, only to find that she is upset over a bad hairdo. Tina is mad at Ethan since he earlier promised to cook dinner, yet he is th ree hours late. She is heading to London the next day on business and decides to call a sitter to look after Zooey, but Ethan insists that she let him take care of her.\n\nLater, Ethan starts to feel dizzy and he faints. He calls Vivi and tells her he\'s hallucinating. She tells him to drink vodka to ease himself. He does just that.\n\nTina leaves the next day, and Zooey comes in wearing a wig with a shade of red. She sees Vivi calling Ethan\'s phone, so he tells her it\'s his boss. She puts \"I Don\'t Care\" by Icona Pop as Ethan\'s ringtone for whenever she calls. Ethan once again tries to get Zooey to ride the bike to school, but she walks and drops the wig.\n\nEthan meets with Vivi again. She gives him the check she promised him and reminds him to keep his heart rate low. She has Ethan go look for a car salesman named Mitat Yilmaz (Marc Andreoni). Ethan goes to the dealership, insults Mitat\'s employees and knocks them out, then waits in Mitat\'s office until he returns. Ethan threatens Mitat\'s family and takes him back to the apartment, until he gets a call from Zooey\'s school, urging him to go speak to the principal. He takes Mitat with him and stuffs him in the trunk.\n\nEthan and Zooey meet with the principal. He learns that Zooey hit another classmate. He asks, \"Open palm or clenched fist?\" As they leave, Zooey tells Ethan it was because the girl she hit was teasing a girl from Pakistan. Ethan says he\'s not mad and tells her it\'s an effective way to get rid of a bully. Mitat starts making a fuss in the trunk, forcing Ethan to go punch him and tell him to shut up. Zooey leaves him, agitated by his behavior and his constant coughing. However, she later calls him back to apologize and asks him to meet her at her favorite spot, a little theme park where her favorite ride is the Flying Chairs. Although Ethan initially goes to continue his search for the accountant, he leaves to meet with Zooey. They go on the ride and have hot chocolate after. She tells him she has to go and study with her lab partner.\n\nEthan goes to a store and is attacked by a man wielding a shotgun. He blasts Ethan, but he rises unharmed (he was most likely wearing a vest), and the two of them fight. The man nearly kills Ethan by stabbing him in the neck, but the man is shot and he dies. Ethan then notices the man was holding a photo of Ethan himself.\n\nEthan goes home to see on Zooey\'s computer a message from a friend saying she\'ll meet her at the Tattoo Gallery. Concerned, Ethan rushes to this place and finds a car with Zooey\'s bag. He breaks into it and finds a flyer from a place called Spider. He goes to Mitat\'s house and asks the man\'s twin daughters what Spider is. They tell him it\'s a soiree house. Ethan goes to Spider, a night club, and sees Zooey drinking with friends. He starts getting dizzy again, and has a swig of vodka to ease up. He follows Zooey near the bathroom and sees three guys harassing her. Ethan is held back by a friend of the boys, but he gets into papa wolf mode and kicks all their asses before getting Zooey out of there.\n\nZooey wakes up the next morning with no memory of the previous night. She\'s still wearing her dress, and she is about to go to school until Ethan tells her not to go like that. He insists on her riding the bike to school, but she angrily reminds him that he never taught her how to ride. He spends the morning teaching her, earning applause from onlookers. Zooey later tearfully asks him why he\'s been away for a long time. She thinks he has another family with another daughter, but he assures her that is not the case. As they continue to hang out, Zooey admits that she hit the girl at school because she was hitting on Hugh. They end up meeting Hugh as he is going to take Zooey to school.\n\nEthan locates the accountant, Guido (Bruno Ricci), as he is escorted through the streets. Ethan shoots a tear gas grenade at the car and takes Guido before blowing the van up. He takes Guido to his apartment to exchange the briefcase with codes he had earlier with codes set to trigger explosives that The Wolf and The Albino are in possession of. Zooey calls to tell Ethan that she is going to cook dinner for Hugh, and she wants to make a vegetarian dish. Ethan puts Guido on the phone to tell Zooey about a spaghetti sauce recipe that his mother used.\n\nThat evening, Ethan comes home to find that Jules\'s daughter is going into labor. She gives birth to a healthy baby girl, and she decides to name it after Ethan due to him allowing them to stay in his home. Jules says they are to leave as promised, but Ethan insists they can stay as long as they want. Jules says the family prefers a smaller home to stay closer to each other.\n\nEthan goes back to Zooey\'s home and learns that Hugh asked her to prom, but she says she can\'t dance. Ethan decides to help her out, just as Tina comes home. She watches them dance, bringing tears to her eyes. They have dinner as a family, and Tina tells Ethan later that he ought to tell Zooey about his condition sooner or later. They end up sleeping together.\n\nThe next morning, Vivi calls Ethan to tell him The Albino is staying at the Grand Hotel. Ethan heads there and spots The Wolf. The villains get in a car driven by Mitat. Ethan chases after them, slamming into the car until he pushes them all over a footbridge. The Wolf and The Albino flee, and Ethan spares Mitat so he can return to his family. Ethan chases the villains into the subway, where he starts to get a nosebleed and he begins to feel dizzy. Before he can shoot The Wolf, The Albino drags a barely conscious Ethan toward the train tracks. He waits for the train to come even as The Wolf yells at him to kill Ethan. Ethan regains enough motion to push The Albino in front of the train just as it passes. He passes out and The Wolf flees. He wakes up to see Vivi brought him to her place. She reminds him of The Wolf\'s escape, but tells him the results of his treatment turned out positive with the drug.\n\nEthan, Zooey, and Tina go to meet with Hugh and his family. His father introduces Ethan to his business partner...The Wolf. They recognize each other and uneasily shake hands. Hugh\'s parents escort them all into a club. Tina eventually realizes that Ethan is working an assignment. She thinks he\'s been lying to her but he assures her that he hasn\'t. The Wolf\'s men shoot at Ethan, and he runs after them. He kills the goons before cornering The Wolf in an elevator. He shoots the wires on the elevator, causing it to fall and crash to the bottom. Meanwhile, Hugh and Zooey find a private room where they dance and share their first kiss.\n\nThe Wolf crawls out of the elevator, and Ethan finds him. He starts to feel weak again, unable to shoot him. He drops the gun, which The Wolf reaches for until Vivi comes in and pushes it to Ethan to finish the job. Thinking about Tina and Zooey, he refuses and drops the gun. Vivi grabs it and shoots The Wolf herself.\n\nSometime later, Ethan is still staying with Zooey in a house near a beach. He\'s setting up a Christmas tree (after thinking he wouldn\'t live to see Christmas), and we hear him talking to Tina, saying there have been bad days, but they are still trying to keep their relationship well. Tina arrives in person, and Ethan acknowledges to her that he hasn\'t always been there for her and Zooey like he should have been. Zooey comes up to invite her mom in so Ethan can make them hot chocolate. Ethan goes into another room while Tina and Zooey sit together. She asks her mom if Ethan is going to stick around now. Meanwhile, Ethan finds a box with a large syringe and a note from Vivi wishing him a Merry Christmas. She has given him the drug so he can continue to live some more as well as spend time with his family.

All three are found guilty and are sentenced to life in prison. Captain Spaulding is executed by lethal injection in prison, however Otis is reunited with his half-brother Winslow Foxworth \"Foxy\" Coltrane.

The owner keeps them occupied by the celebration and local prostitutes, so as to keep them from moving to another area.

The shark then proceeds to attack the Persephone, an underwater research facility studying the Pacific Garbage Patch. The resulting damage causes the facility to explode, killing everybody inside. However, marine biologists Ted Nelson and Laura Thomas escape, as well as a group of activists touring the lab consisting of Greg, Ryan Bennett, Omar and Alison, and college graduate Maggie Peterson, who was applying for a job at the facility, and is also Greg\'s ex-girlfriend. The island the facility is based on begins to flood, and the group is forced to swim out to the activists\' boat as a result, although Laura and Omar are eaten in the process. The others reach the boat, although the shark follows them as they drive. Ryan manages to contact fisherman Max Burns over the radio, and asks for help. Burns is hesitant to believe them, although he reluctantly agrees to help them.\n\nThe shark begins to head toward a party boat carrying teenagers. The group attempts to warn them, although they\'re too late, as the shark consistently rams into the boat, knocking numerous people into the water where they\'re eaten. The group manages to board the boat in order to help injured passengers, and Maggie, and Nelson are enlisted as help by passengers Stanley, and Rosemarie Grant to help find Rosemarie\'s boyfriend Howard, who had disappeared into the abandoned dining area during the chaos.

Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) works for Vito\'s Pizza, which has a strict 30-minutes-or-less delivery policy... which means either Nick makes it to the customer\'s door in half an hour or he has to pay for the pizza himself. There\'s a timer in the shape of a tiny, stereotypical Italian chef ticking away on his dashboard as Nick races through Grand Rapids, his stereo blaring, past kids playing in parks and other people trying to go about their days with this madman driving on the roads. Nick makes it to his destination, two towns away from Vito\'s Pizza, in 34 minutes... four minutes late. Two stoned teenagers answer the door, proud of themselves for gaming the system and getting another pizza free. Nick confronts them, telling them the pie\'s going to come out of his own pocket, but they don\'t care. \"That\'s why we order your crappy pizza\", they say, \"because you can\'t ever get here in time\". Nick decides to scam the scammers by telling them he can get them beer if they give him the money their mom gave them for the pizza. The kids have no idea what they are doing, but think it would be cool to have beer, and Nick tells asks them, \"You like O\'Doules, right?\". Clueless, the kids say, \"Hell yah, we\'re totally down with that shit\".\n\nNick is dejected with his life and heads home, where he drinks real beer (not O\'Doules) on his porch waiting for his friend Chet (Aziz Ansari) to get home from a date. Chet\'s actually sitting in a parked car outside, where his date is performing oral sex on him from the passenger seat. She finishes what she\'s doing and then quickly moves to kiss him, in a gross-out scene where Chet \"tastes himself\", as Nick (who has been watching) puts it later. \"Do you want some beer to wash the taste of yourself out of your mouth?\", Nick asks Chet when he finally walks over. Nick is a big movie fan and has DVDs of the Lethal Weapon series for Chet and him to watch, but Chet says he\'s tired and has to work tomorrow. Nick tells him to just call-in sick, \"like the real teachers do\", because Chet\'s a substitute teacher. \"You know they made me a real teacher a few months ago. You gave me a laser pointer as a congratulations gift,\" Chet scolds Nick, telling him that he\'s an adult with a career now and can\'t stay up all night watching old action movies and drinking beer with his pizza delivering friend.\n\nThe next day, Dwayne (Danny McBride) and his dimwit sidekick Travis (Nick Swardson) are target-shooting watermelons in an old scrap yard. Dwayne purports to be a major player and educates Travis about all the \"pussy\" he has gotten, knows about, and obsesses over in general. Travis hangs on every word. Though both are numb skulls, Dwayne is the leader and Travis is the even dimmer follower. The two use crossbows, detonators, and other weapons to blow up the watermelons, with Travis being a kind of idiot savant when it comes to explosives.\n\nDwayne and Travis have been friends since childhood, and though in their mid to late 30s they still behave like immature teenagers. Back at Dwayne\'s father\'s house, the two watch \"Friday the 13th: 3D\" where Dwayne starts heckling Jason Vorhees on the screen, as if characters in the film can hear him. Travis follows Dwayne\'s lead, like always, and the two jump up from their seats pretending they are anal-raping Jason and \"teaching him what good pussy\" is, whatever that means. As they\'re carrying on with these pantomimes, Dwayne\'s father \"The Major\" (Fred Ward) walks in, berating Dwayne and his friend for acting so stupid and sexual together. The Major is a retired United States Marine with little tolerance for his ne\'er do well son\'s antics. The Major repeatedly calls his son a \"faggot\" and alludes to something more than friendship between Dwayne and Travis, since the two of them spend so much time together and The Major evidently catches them in weird situations like this quite a bit. It\'s revealed The Major won a $10 million lottery prize in 1998, which funds an opulent lifestyle for him... and supports unemployed Dwayne. The Major\'s house is filled with all sorts of high tech gadgets, along with a driveway full of expensive trucks with hyper-patriotic American flag/eagle airbrushed detailing. Dwayne is jealous of his father\'s money and wants to get control of what\'s left from the lottery winnings before The Major spends it all on more trucks.\n\nMeanwhile, Nick appears to be on another Vito\'s pizza run but instead is heading to visit Kate (Dilshad Vadsaria), who works at some sort of event planning/catering company. Kate is Chet\'s twin sister. Nick has harbored a romantic interest in her for some time. While they are talking, Kate tells Nick that a classmate of theirs from high school, Tom Smalls, has just come out on Facebook as gay.\n\n(Since the actor Jesse Eisenberg was in \"The Social Network\" movie portraying Facebook\'s founder, this is one of a few in-jokes in the film).\n\nKate tells Nick she has been offered a job with the Four Seasons hotel chain, to take a management training position in the special events department of an Atlanta hotel. Nick clearly does not want Kate to move to Atlanta, so he tells her bad things he\'s heard about \"Hot-lanta\" from various rap songs. He tells Kate he will make her a mixed CD of these raps to prove it to her.\n\nAcross town, in a sleazy strip club, Dwayne\'s bought a lap dance from a stripper named Juicy (Bianca Kajlich), who soon realizes that Dwayne\'s father has a few million dollars. Juicy talks Dwayne into hiring an \"assassin\" she knows from Detroit who will kill his father so Dwayne can inherit his money... and presumably give Juicy a large cut. Juicy bares her large breasts to him, telling Dwayne he can be king and have her as his \"scepter polisher\". The tiny hamster inside Dwayne\'s head starts to spin in its wheel.\n\nAt Chet\'s apartment, Nick tells his friend he does not want Kate to move to Atlanta. Chet tells Nick to leave his sister alone, and that she\'s an adult pursuing her career, unlike Nick who is just a pizza delivery boy in his late 20s. Chet reminds Nick that he ate a Lunchables for dinner the night before, so he can\'t discourage anyone from being an adult when he\'s never tried it himself. The two friends then engage in a pissing contest trying to one up each other by revealing bad things they did to each other. Nick did sexual things with a girl Chet liked. Chet told everyone in town that Nick\'s mother had sex with a life guard at the community pool (which then caused Nick\'s parents to divorce after Nick\'s dad was cuckolded and his mother was branded the town slut). Nick tells Chet he had sex with his twin sister Kate after prom, but Chet argues that Nick said he\'d slept with some other girl... Nick says he only changed the girl\'s name, but that everything else he told him about the sex was true. Chet is horrified. Nick pushes it by asking, since the two are twins, if Chet felt it when Nick was having sex with Kate. The two friends then wrestle around on the floor for dominance, upset with each other. Chet puts Nick into a sleeper hold, upset with him for deflowering his twin sister.\n\nBack at The Major\'s mansion, Dwayne and Travis are cleaning the pool for $10 an hour. Dwayne believes he sleeps late and has no job because his dreams are too big to allow him to do anything else. He has many delusions of grandeur, including schemes for various businesses that will make him rich, if only he had the seed money to get them going (such as a Chinese restaurant or an abortion clinic). He also wants to open a tanning salon that would really be a front for a brothel, where various code words would be used by men looking for prostitutes. There would be regular tanning as well, but a \"Deluxe Tan\" would mean a man wanted oral sex after his irradiation. Travis, of course, thinks Dwayne is a genius. The Major, however, thinks his son\'s an idiot and pops in to check on his pool cleaning work. Dwayne resents his father and tells Travis of the plan to hire an assassin to kill him... something Travis is disturbingly very quick to agree to. Dwayne tells Travis that it will cost $100,000 to hire the assassin and that they need to start thinking like millionaires...since once he gets that $100,000 and hires someone to kill his father, he will inherit the millions and will \"own the whole town\".\n\nDwayne and Travis hole up in Travis\' garage where they continue to plot ways to get the $100,000 for the assassin. Dwayne entertains the fantasy of finding a woman who he can have sex with on camera, and then force to have sex with all sorts of other men on camera, so they can blackmail her husband and force him to rob a bank for them. But the two decide they don\'t know any married women who are \"slutty enough\" for that. Dwayne wants to use hypnotism to force a man to rob a bank for them, but Travis reminds Dwayne how adroit he is manufacturing explosives, so the two decide to find someone, strap a bomb to him, and force him to rob a bank if he wants to live. While they are trying to decide what sort of guy they could lure into this trap, a commercial for Vito\'s Pizza airs and Dwayne decides to use a pizza delivery guy as his patsy. Dwayne says that Fate\'s fat cock has slapped him in the face.\n\nAt the scrap yard from earlier in the film, which is super creepy at night. Nick was supposed to be off work, but Vito (Brett Gelman) made him take one last pizza run. Nick makes it to the scrap yard 15 minutes late and is worried he will have to pay for another late order. When he knocks on a derelict trailer to deliver the pie, Dwayne answers in a creepy gorilla mask. Nick\'s nervous, and tries backing away but Travis (in a very Planet of the Apes chimpanzee mask) knocks him over the head until he passes out. Nick\'s screaming RAPE! the whole time. When he comes to, it\'s daylight and Dwayne and Travis have strapped a bomb to his chest. Nick tries calling for help, but the scrap yard is very isolated and Dwayne tells him he\'d have a better chance of someone hearing him in outer space. The bomb\'s made with C-4 explosives wired to a remote detonator that is activated with a cellphone. There\'s a lock on the front with a 6-digit combination, which Dwayne says he\'ll give Nick when Nick delivers him $100,000. The bomb has a large yellow smiley face on the front.\n\nNick tells them he can sell his car and get maybe $1,000, but that he does not have any idea how he can get $100,000. Dwayne tells him to just rob a bank. And that he has 10 hours until the bomb explodes so he better move quickly. To demonstrate the bomb, Dwayne detonates a similar vest that Travis rigged to a teddy bear. After it explodes, he tells Nick, \"I liked that bear, and I don\'t even know you, so you better hurry\". Nick\'s told the pair will be watching him and if he goes to the police they will dial the code and make him explode like the bear. Nick burns rubber peeling out of the scrap yard, off to rob a bank and do whatever they say.\n\nNick heads to the school where Chet works and interrupts his teaching. Chet\'s scolding a boy who has been texting in class, by reading the boy\'s text about liking a girl named Lisa. \"This Lisa? Over here? She\'s too good for you. Stop texting in my class,\" he tells the boy, just as Nick barges in. Outside in the hallway Nick shows Chet the bomb and Chet says, \"So two dudes kidnap you and strap a bomb to your chest and the first place you think to go is an elementary school filled with children?\". Nick begs Chet to help him and Chet ultimately agrees, because he says he does not want this to affect his future relationships...like one day he would be with his wife and kids and he\'d be sorry he \"let that guy I knew blow up\" when he could have helped. Chet makes Nick promise him that if he helps him with this that he will leave his sister alone and not talk to Kate again. The two leave the school to figure out a way to get the bomb vest off Nick.\n\nMeanwhile, Juicy the stripper meets with her \"assassin\" from Detroit, a Mexican named Changa who calls himself \"Sugarmilk\" (Michael Pena) and is covered with tattoos. Changa agrees to kill The Major and Juicy tells him arrangements have been made to get him his $100,000 for the hit. Juicy and Changa have a romantic relationship and have sex in his car apparently.\n\nBack at Chet\'s apartment. Chet\'s been looking up ways to disarm the bomb on Wikipedia, with little luck. Various movies like Hurt Locker and Point Break are referenced, as the two friends try thinking about anything they\'ve ever seen on film that could help them either disarm the bomb or rob a bank to get the $100,000. Ultimately, they decide to rob the bank and Nick tells Chet they should hit the bank that\'s near the Olive Garden in a shopping center. They proceed to a Family Dollar store to get bank robbing supplies.\n\nDwayne and Travis are watching them, and sit outside in a car listening to a mixed tape while Nick and Chet buy their supplies. Dwayne keeps talking about his tanning salon/brothel idea and the two talk about various specials they would offer, like a \"Tanny Glover\", which would be the code word for sex with a black female prostitute after buying a tan. Dwayne tells Travis that he will be working the front desk at the tanning salon, but Travis does not think it\'s an important enough job, though Dwayne reassures him it\'s important because Travis would be the one keeping track of the code words and what various people want in terms of prostitutes. There\'s actually a vacant storefront next to the Family Dollar store that Dwayne thinks would be perfect for the salon/brothel.\n\nThe woman working checkout in Family Dollar asks Nick and Chet if they are buying rape kits, since they\'re purchasing fake guns and ski masks along with other odd items. Chet\'s also getting a hamburger sliders kit, so he tells the checkout woman she\'s crazy, and that they just love sliders and skiing. The woman tells them they better get some condoms too if they are going to be raping anyone. After they leave the store, Chet\'s spray-painting the toy guns black so they look more real, and Nick tells him not to spray that paint inside his car. \"This car looks like a Mustang that got AIDS and died of cancer\", Chet says, and the two have a fight over how pathetic Nick\'s car is. They then decide to steal the red Dotson owned by Chet\'s parents\' neighbors, the Fishers, because they need a fast getaway vehicle. They drive over to the Fishers house and are looking for the keys to the car in the garage when Mr. Fisher walks in on them. The two know the Fishers\' son Dylan works at a travel agency, is \"a douche\", and has \"bad bangs\". They tell Mr. Fisher that if he doesn\'t cooperate, they will come after Dylan. Wearing their masks and brandishing their fake guns, they rob him of his keys and steal the car, with Chet politely saying \"Thank you\" and \"Goodbye Mr. Fisher\" afterwards...which is something Chet does throughout the various crimes the two will commit all day.\n\nChet is worried he was recognized because there are only four Indian families in Grand Rapids and he realizes his brown skin and hands were visible through the robbers\' disguise. Nick claims he wants to make a quick stop and quit his pizza delivery job before they rob the bank, and Chet argues with him in the car that they don\'t have time to be running errands like this, and if they did have time like that they should stop for breakfast or maybe lunch because Chet is hungry. Nick gets his way and they drive to Vito\'s Pizza where Nick slips inside, quits, and then races out the back door. Nick actually runs down the street to where Kate works while Chet thinks he\'s still inside Vito\'s. Nick takes Kate onto the roof of her building and tells her that he\'s never forgotten the night they had sex and that he has feelings for her, then he rushes away. Nick doesn\'t realize it, but Travis was following him the whole time, and was pretending to be a maintenance man working on the banister in the stairwell when Nick ran by him. Travis reports back to Dwayne on his cellphone that Nick came to visit this girl (important later).\n\nNick races back to the car and finds Chet inside eating hamburgers and drinking 5-Hour-Energy drinks. The two decide to pretend to be Hispanic criminals when they burst into the bank to rob it. Nick will be \"Cruz\" and Chet will be \"Luiz\" when they\'re inside the bank. When they burst in, the bank is filled with very nice Midwestern people who are surprisingly helpful during the holdup. Nick and Chet get them all onto the floor and work with a bank employee named Sandra to get $100,000 into a bag. Sandra had to go into the vault to get the money, which broke a rule Nick and Chet learned from the movie Point Break, which said to never worry about the vault and instead just focus on whatever money was in the teller drawers. Sandra slips a blue dye bomb back into the money, per bank policy. In all the commotion, a security guard\'s gun accidentally goes off and shoots a man in the leg. Nick feels bad about this and decides to peel off some money and give it to the man. When he does so, the blue dye explodes in the man\'s face. Nick and Chet are upset with Sandra, and tell her to get a new pack of money out of the vault... this time with no blue dye in it. Sandra retrieves a new bag... but what Nick and Chet don\'t realize is that the blue dye packs are in ALL the money (important later). The bank\'s alarm goes off and Nick and Chet flee the bank, stopped outside by a cop who pulls a gun on them. Chet opens his coat to show his bomb, telling the cop, \"Looks like you brought a gun to a bomb fight\". The cop takes one look at the bomb and runs away crying. Nick and Chet escape in the Dotson and engage in a high speed police chase set to the 80s song \"The Heat is On\". Nick uses his pizza delivery driving skills to evade the cop cars, zooming in and out of traffic, and getting a cop car or two totaled at intersections when Nick guns it through red lights. Nick attempts to do a 180 turn to throw the cops off, but spins too much and ends up doing a full 360, defeating his purpose. Finally, Nick and Chet are wrecked when a cop car smashes into them. They escape the scene of the crash on foot, with Chet wounded by car shrapnel, and the two calmly walk onto a bus to get away. Dwayne and Travis arrive at the scene and join passersby who are videotaping the wreckage for YouTube, pleased that Nick has actually pulled off the robbery.\n\nWalking down a suburban street to reclaim Nick\'s Mustang, Nick and Chet recount their bank robbery adventure the way two male friends would retell some exploit in a bar or what they did in a big game, with each embellishing things they said or did. Neither of them show any concern at all for all the crimes they just committed. The next step is for Nick to call Dwayne and arrange a pickup of the money -- where Nick essentially buys the 6-digit code that will unlock the bomb on his chest.\n\nDwayne\'s waiting for the call at a cheap Mexican restaurant called Taco Boy. Dwayne calls Juicy on his cell and tells her the money is coming, and arranges for Juicy and Changa to meet Nick at an abandoned bridge somewhere in just a few minutes. Dwayne revels in more fantasies about owning his tanning salon/brothel, as Travis starts to feel bad about what they have done, now that he realizes Dwayne wants to kill Nick by detonating the bomb after they\'ve got the money. Travis believed Nick would go free once this was all over. When Dwayne gets up to use the bathroom, Travis disables the bomb via remote by switching the cell phone numbers...so if Dwayne tries to deactivate the bomb, he will call the wrong number and nothing will happen.\n\nNick\'s waiting at the bridge when Changa and Juicy show up. Chet\'s hiding somewhere off screen. Nick gives Changa the money and asks for the code to deactivate the bomb but Changa doesn\'t have it... since Dwayne had no intention of deactivating the bomb. A fight ensues, with Chet joining in to smack Changa upside the head, before Chet and Juicy tussle. Nick and Chet leave, with Chet calling them \"bad people\". Changa is furious and tells Dwayne that he is now going to assassinate Dwayne, since he does not have the $100,000 anymore because Nick and Chet took it back after they fought with Changa and Juicy. Dwayne is terrified that the assassin is now coming after him. Nick realizes that Dwayne had no intention of giving him the code, and when he talks to Dwayne on the phone the power shifts between them since Nick also realizes that Dwayne can\'t push the button to kill him since Dwayne would destroy all the money too. \"At least I will die a rich man,\" Nick says.\n\nTravis is giving Dwayne a haircut while all of this is going down, with Dwayne now insisting that the FBI, CIA, and NASA are going to be coming for him. He wants to just blow Nick up anyway, and dials the number on the phone only to have Moviefone answer. Travis then explains he switched the number at Taco Boy because he couldn\'t believe Dwayne would kill Nick. Travis then tells Dwayne about Kate, and how she is a way to get the money back from Nick without killing anyone. All they have to do is kidnap her. Dwayne and Travis then rush to do this, while avoiding Changa who wants to kill Dwayne.\n\nThe Major is in his mansion watching the \'Real Housewives of Atlanta\', and enjoying himself, when Changa breaks in to assassinate Dwayne. The Major picks up a pen gun and moves stealthily through his house, using his Marines training. We see the giant $10 million lottery check that The Major won in 1998 framed and hanging on a wall as The Major moves through is home, ultimately shooting Changa in the neck... before Changa gets on top of him and shoots him in the stomach. The Major tells Changa he is not afraid of death and \"will ride you all the way to Hell, because I know the way\" as the two men fight. The Major would not tell Changa where Dwayne was, though he was not surprised that Dwayne had tried to hire Changa to kill The Major. The Major still protected his son, even after his son betrayed him. Changa leaves The Major wounded and bleeding from his stomach onto the floor and heads to the bathroom to pour alcohol over his wound, telling himself in the mirror that he\'s a pimp and needs to be tough. Changa then searches the house for clues to where Dwayne may be and ends up finding a crudely drawn map (like a small child made it) of the scrap yard that Dwayne and Travis use for their antics.\n\nBack at the scrap yard, Dwayne and Travis are heading there with kidnapped Kate, while Nick and Chet are driving there to deliver the money and rescue her. Nick produces the cash and Dwayne gives him the code...696969, which Dwayne reveals to be his favorite sexual position. There\'s now just 4 minutes and 9 seconds before the bomb explodes. Dwayne\'s wearing his gorilla mask again and Travis is dressed up as the chimp, but this time he\'s also wearing a flamethrower on his back that makes him look like a Ghostbuster on the Planet of the Apes.\n\nNick gains the upper hand by claiming he has a sniper hidden somewhere who will shoot Dwayne and Travis. They don\'t believe him, but a red dot appears on Dwayne\'s forehead, which Travis says \"looks like that dot on her people\'s heads\", making a racist joke at the expense of Kate, who is Indian like her brother Chet. It\'s shown the sniper is actually Chet, using the laser pointer that Nick bought him when he was made a real teacher and not just a substitute (remember the throwaway line delivered about this earlier in the film). Chet moves the laser pointer lower so that it appears the sniper is going to shoot Dwayne in the chest if he does not release Kate.\n\nChanga arrives and declares himself to be \"the Satanic Hispanic\" and punches Nick in the face in retribution for the attack Chet made on him earlier in the day. Then Changa turns his attention to Dwayne and fires his gun at him. Travis fires up the flamethrower next and scorches Changa, burning him to a crisp. Changa gets one last shot off, however, and punctures the tank on Travis\' back, making the flamethrower explode. In this melee, Chet grabs Kate as Nick ducks away to grab the money and place the bomb vest into Dwayne\'s car after resetting the timer to explode.\n\nChanga dies. Travis lives. Dwayne gets in the car to chase down Nick, Chet, and Kate and get the $100,000 back. Since Nick knows the bomb is about to explode, he maneuvers his Mustang to avoid the blast. Dwayne\'s car catches fire and flips off the road with him still inside.\n\nAs they drive away, Nick, Chet, and Kate then start thinking about what they could do with all that stolen bank money. When Kate starts flipping through the stacks of bills, the blue dye explodes in their faces and all over the car.\n\nTHE END\n\nAs the credits roll, there is a quick commercial for \"Major Tan\"... the tanning salon/brothel that it appears Dwayne, Travis, and The Major opened next to the Family Dollar Store. A bevy of bikini clad prostitutes vamp it up in the commercial, as Dwayne lets viewers know it\'s both a tanning salon and a place for men to get oral sex from a variety of women... including a \"Menage a Tan\" where two women would service one man.\n\n(Apparently, this bit was part of the original ending of the film...which was supposed to include an epilogue showing what happened to all the various characters. The Major is now in a wheelchair because of his bullet wound and Dwayne and Travis appear unscathed by everything that happened. After this commercial ends, the film is completely over and it fades to black.)',2983,28000000,'US',40500000),(96,'30,000 Leagues Under The Sea','2007-09-09',90,0,'Captain Nemo goes even deeper into insanity in this mesmerizing fantasy tale.

Battle of Thermopylae, where the King of Sparta led his army against the advancing Persians; the battle is said to have inspired all of Greece to band together against the Persians, and helped usher in the world\'s first democracy.','Spartan customs are harsh. The Spartans inspect each infant born to ensure it is whole - if it is deformed, the baby is abandoned to die. They raise their boys in the school of hard knocks, the agoge - in combat training, a small boy\'s loss of his weapon earns a bloody lip from the hand of his own father. At age 7, each young boy is torn from his mother and makes his own way in the wilderness, to return a man. Even the King endures this rite of passage. At age 15, young King-to-be Leonidas (Tyler Neitzel) lures a wolf into a narrow passage so that he can kill it. He returns home to be crowned King.\n\nYears later, messengers visit King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) requesting Sparta\'s submission to King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro). Insulted by their attitude, King Leonidas kicks the messengers into a well. Acknowledging the threat of Xerxes\'s invasion force, he visits the Ephors (priests) to obtain their favour before sending the Spartan army in battle. He proposes to repel the numerically superior enemy by using the terrain of the Hot Gates of Thermopylae, funneling the Persians into a narrow pass between the rocks and the sea, where their immense numbers will \"count for nothing.\" The Ephors, wary of the plan, consult the Oracle (Kelly Craig). In her drugged trance she decrees that Sparta must not go to war, lest they interrupt the sacred Carneian festival. Leonidas departs in anger, and the priests receive their bribe of Xerxes\' gold from the Spartan traitor, Theron (Dominic West), for their negative response.\n\nLeonidas is reluctant to defy the corrupt clergy outright, but his wife (Lena Headey) encourages him to think outside the box. Leonidas elects to take 300 of his best soldiers as his \"bodyguard\" on a leisurely walk to the strategic Hot Gates location. His wife says goodbye, telling him to come back \"with his shield or on it\", and gives him a necklace.\n\nOn the road they meet some allies, who are shocked that the Spartans are sending such a small force. Leonidas asks the professions of the allied army, who are craftsmen and artisans. He points out that he has brought more soldiers than they. Joined by Arcadians and other Greeks, they arrive at Thermopylae. In sight of the approaching Persian army, they construct a wall to contain the Persians\' advance. Strong storms destroy some of Xerxes fleet, but it is only a small percentage of the massive army they will face.\n\nA horribly disfigured man, Ephialtes (Andrew Tiernan), comes to see Leonidas to warn him of a disused goat path at the rear of his position. Ephialtes claims that his parents fled Sparta at his birth to save his life. He hopes to redeem them by fighting for Leonidas. Leonidas explains that each Spartan warrior is a key part of the phalanx, and asks Ephialtes to show that he can lift his shield high enough to properly defend his fellow warriors. When it becomes evident that he cannot, Leonidas gently tells him to care for the fallen instead. Ephialtes\' fondest hopes are crushed.\n\nA Persian emissary arrives, and finds that the corpses of the previous scouting party now make up part of the large rock wall. The Persian states that their arrows will blot out the sun, and the Spartans agree they will simply fight in the shade. The emissary\'s party is killed.\n\nPrior to the battle the Persians demand that the Spartans drop their arms and surrender. Leonidas refuses and challenges the Persians to come and take their weapons from them. With their tightly-knit phalanx formation, the Spartans funnel the Persians into the narrow terrain, repeatedly rebuffing them and inflicting heavy casualties.\n\nXerxes, impressed with Spartan fighting skill, personally approaches Leonidas to persuade him to surrender. He promises Leonidas wealth and power in exchange for his loyalty. Leonidas declines, promising instead to make the \"God King\" bleed, and turns to rejoin his army.\n\nDismayed at the refusal, Xerxes sends his masked personal guard, \"The Immortals\", which name the Spartans also prove false. The battles continue, with the Spartans prevailing over soldiers and animals drawn from the vast reaches of the Persian empire: from Mongolian barbarians and Eastern chemists to African rhinoceroses and Indian war elephants. However, some of the brave Spartan warriors are killed, and it becomes clear that more will follow.\n\nEphialtes goes to Xerxes, and agrees to show the goat path to the Persians in exchange for a uniform, along with promises of women and wealth. Xerxes will grant Ephialtes his wish if he will kneel before the god king.\n\nBack in Sparta, Queen Gorgo has been trying to convince the council to send help to Leonidas. A friendly councilman arranges for her to speak, but explains that she will need Theron on her side. Theron agrees to help her if she will sleep with him - so she does.\n\nAt the Hot Gates, the Spartans learn they have been betrayed, and know their fight is doomed. The Arcadians retreat in the face of certain death. The Spartans refuse to follow. Leonidas orders a reluctant Dilios to return to Sparta and tell of their inevitable deaths.\n\nIn Sparta, Queen Gorgo makes her appeal to the council. Instead of supporting her as promised, Theron betrays her, accusing her of adultery. Enraged, Gorgo snatches a sword and stabs Theron, rupturing a bag of gold hidden in his robe. As the coins stamped with Persian markings spill onto the ground, the Council realizes Theron\'s treachery and agree to unite against Persia.\n\nAt the Hot Gates, as the Persians surround the Spartans, who have created a dome out of their shields. Leonidas stands along in front of the dome. Xerxes\'s general demands their surrender, declaring that Leonidas may keep his title as King of Sparta and become Warlord of all Greece, answerable only to Xerxes. Ephialtes urges this as well, to which Leonidas remarks, \"May you live forever,\" an insult from a culture valuing death and valor in battle. Leonidas drops his shield and removes his helmet, seemingly bowing in submission. Stelios then bursts out of the dome and leaps over his king and kills the general. A furious Xerxes orders his troops to attack. As Persian archers shoot the remaining Spartans, Leonidas rises and hurls his spear at Xerxes, ripping open his cheek, thus making \"the God-King bleed.\" Xerxes, visibly shaken by this reminder of his own mortality, watches as the remaining Spartans perish beneath the combined might of his army. Leonidas himself marks his final moments by telling his wife aloud that he loves her. A rain of arrows falls upon him and the screen goes black. Back in Sparta, Dilios gives the necklace to Queen Gorgo and tells her of her husband\'s fate.\n\nConcluding his tale before an audience of attentive Spartans, Dilios declares that the 120,000-strong Persian army that narrowly defeated 300 Spartans now faces 10,000 Spartans commanding 30,000 Greeks.

But Thomas Murphy decided to keep all the money for himself and shot all his partners, including recently-freed ex-con Michael Zane. With $3.2 million at stake, the Marshals Service closing in, Michael must track down Murphy.','The film opens outside of Las Vegas, in the scorching Nevada desert. Michael (Kurt Russell) stops at the Last Resort Hotel and Cafe, where he gets a room. As he is going back to his car, a little kid named Jesse (David Kaye) takes two of the custom skullhead valve caps off of Michael\'s car. Michael chases him, but Jesse kicks him in the shin. Jesse then runs into the arms of his young mother Cybil (Courteney Cox Arquette), who makes Jesse give back the caps. Michael is immediately attracted to her, and asks her to breakfast. He then has sex with her. Later, a car with four men dressed like Elvis pull up, Murphy (Kevin Costner), Hanson (Christian Slater), Gus (David Arquette), and Franklin (Bokeem Woodbine). Murphy picks up Michael from the motel, and the five of them venture out to an airplane hangar, where they meet yet another con, Jack (Howie Long), a helicopter pilot. Inside the hangar are five suit and guitar cases. Michael goes back to the motel, where he knocks on Cybil\'s door looking for his missing wallet, which her son took. She reaches into a crawlspace in the ceiling and finds Michael\'s wallet, and gives it back to him. He is about to leave, but Cybil yet again lures him back into bed.\n\nThe next day, Michael drives back to Las Vegas. He joins the other four men, who are all dressed up as Elvis. It\'s International Elvis Week in Las Vegas, so everybody there is dressed as The King. Michael and Murphy\'s plan is to rob the Riviera Casino in broad daylight, dressed as Elvis, so no one can identify them. As the five are walking towards the money cages in the back, a previous acquaintance of Murphy\'s recognizes him and greets him. Murphy ends up knocking him out in order to keep his anonymity. As they get closer to the back, Michael breaks off, and gets into an elevator. The rest of them burst into the room, with machine guns, and grab the money. The security cameras watch all of this, and notify the hotel security and Vegas PD. The plan is not to walk out into the streets, but rather get to the roof, and be picked up by Jack in the helicopter. Murphy and the other three are almost at the elevators, where Michael is waiting, but Murphy sets off panic when he blows away a security guard. A huge gunfight occurs within the casino, with the security being mostly cut down to size. Michael opens the elevator door, and sees a security guy with his back to him. Michael is about to shoot him, but knocks him out instead. As the men enter the elevator, a Las Vegas police officer starts shooting into the elevator, hitting Franklin in the chest. Murphy sticks his gun through the crack in the doors and shoots the officer in the head. They make it to the roof, but Jack isn\'t there yet. They hold off the cops and security on the roof, until Jack arrives. Murphy tries to save Franklin, but Franklin finally dies from his wounds. Murphy then throws Franklin\'s dead body out of the helicopter.\n\nThe group now go back to Michael\'s hotel, where Jesse is hiding and watching everything. Hanson counts the money, which comes out to $3.2 million. The four split up the money. Hanson also decides to split up Franklin\'s cut, but Murphy refuses, saying Franklin\'s cut should go to him. Hanson gets upset with Murphy and points his gun at him, but doesn\'t shoot him. After he puts his gun away and sits back down Murphy shoots Hanson under the table hitting him in the leg, then shoots him again in the chest killing him. Gus, Michael, and Murphy now have to dispose of the body, so Michael hides the money in the crawlspace, and the three drive out to the middle of the desert to bury Hanson. While there, Murphy shoots Gus and Michael as well. Murphy is driving back, in Michael\'s car, when several coyotes wander out onto the road, causing Murphy to hit one and swerve off the road into a ditch, where he is knocked unconscious. The news spreads about the robbery, making headlines, and sparking the interest of two federal marshals, Quigley (Thomas Haden Church) and Damitry (Kevin Pollak). They learn that Murphy is the mastermind, thanks to the man that Murphy knocked out in the casino. They also learn that Murphy thinks he\'s the son of Elvis. Michael, left for dead suddenly awakes, and hitchhikes back to his hotel room. He takes two bullets out of his bulletproof vest. He reaches into the crawlspace to get the money, but it\'s missing. Michael storms into Cybil\'s place and grabs Jesse. Cybil threatens to call the police, but Michael suddenly finds the money, causing Cybil to hang up. Michael decides to pay Cybil off with $100,000 for silence, but Cybil wants to go with him. Suddenly, the police knock at the door, responding to Cybil\'s emergency call. The police believe that Cybil dial 911 by accident and Michael leaves the hotel with Cybil and Jesse.\n\nThe next morning, Murphy drives back to the hotel, but does not find the money. Michael explains to Cybil that the money is marked, but Murphy worked out a deal with a real estate man in Twin Falls, Idaho named J. Peterson (Jon Lovitz), who would exchange the money with them for 70 cents to the dollar, so they\'re on their way to meet him. However, Murphy is following them. Along the way, he kills almost everyone he meets. Meanwhile, Michael, Cybil and Jesse are eating at a restaurant, but Cybil cleverly sneaks away, and steals Michael\'s wallet and car. So now, Michael is stuck with Jesse, with no car or money. Jesse, however, is a clever thief, and steals money through pickpocketing and even steals a truck for Michael. Cybil calls J. Peterson and says the password, \"Cleanliness is next to godliness.\" Peterson decides to wait for her, but Murphy suddenly appears, saying the same thing. Peterson explains that Cybil called first, so he must wait for her.\n\nFinally, Cybil arrives, and finds only Murphy, who she assumes is Peterson. Then, Michael and Jesse arrive, and find the place empty, except for Peterson\'s dead body in the bathroom, next to a dead woman. Jesse starts to cry, thinking it\'s his mother, but it\'s really Peterson\'s secretary. Murphy is driving Michael\'s car, so Michael calls the cops and reports his car stolen. Murphy is then arrested, but Michael is also arrested when it is learned that the truck he is driving is stolen as well. Murphy and Michael are put in neighboring jail cells, where Murphy explains how he thought Michael was dead. Michael asks where the girl is, but Murphy is very obscure about his answer. Suddenly, Michael makes bail, thanks to Jesse, who hired a lawyer, under the agreement that Jesse make him his partner. Michael is set free, however, with his one phone call, Murphy calls Jack and arranges to get out as well. Michael and Jesse get to Michael\'s car, and opens the trunk, and finds Cybil, tied up but still alive. Murphy is now out, and is hitchhiking. He is picked up by a college football fan, with team attire and face-paint. When they come to a roadblock, Murphy kills the fan, and puts on his clothes. He pretends to be a fan in front of the cops, and they let him go. Murphy sees Cybil and Jesse pass by in a car. He runs them off the road, and grabs Jesse, to hold as collateral so that Cybil will go get Michael and the money. Cybil finally finds Michael and he decides to go find Jesse.\n\nMurphy has met back up with Jack, who has enlisted the help of a one-man army by the name of Hamilton (Ice-T). Michael appears with the money, and puts a gun to Jack\'s head, and offers to exchange for Jesse. Murphy and Michael swap, but it is revealed that the bag with the money is actually filled with newspaper and a scorpion that stings Murphy\'s arm as he reaches into the bag. Suddenly, a SWAT team, led by Quigley and Damitry, surround the place. Murphy puts his hands up, but quickly grabs a shotgun and shoots Michael. Another huge gunfight ensues, with Jack and Murphy shooting their fair amount of cops. When some cops are about to shoot Murphy, Jack jumps in the way and is shot. As the police are surrounding him, Hamilton appears and shoots many cops. Quigley, however, shoots Hamilton. Murphy is now alone, getting weaker from the scorpion sting and the marshals realize that he\'s not giving up. Murphy is finally put down, after a barrage of bullets tear into him. Michael is rushed by ambulance to the nearest hospital. However, the ambulance is stolen by Cybil and Jesse. Michael, once again, wore a bulletproof vest, and is only injured in the shoulder. The last scene shows Michael, Cybil, and Jesse on Michael\'s boat, sailing away. The name on the side of the boat reads Graceland.

Themistocles faces the massive invading Persian forces led by mortal-turned-god, Xerxes and Artemesia, the vengeful commander of the Persian navy.','Note: this film is actually a prequel as well as a sequel to the original \'300\' film (with the events happening before, concurrently, and after the events of the previous film).\n\nIn the opening scene, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) narrates about King Darius (Igal Naor) leading his army of Persians into Greece in the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC during the first Persian invasion of Greece. The Athenian general Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) led his own army against them at the shores. The Greeks brutally and effortlessly take down the invading Persians one by one, paving the way for Themistocles to take aim at Darius, who is watching the massacre of his men from his ship offshore. Themistocles raises a bow and arrow, ready to commit the act that would make him known as a legend. He releases the bow just in time for Darius\'s son, Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) to watch. He runs to his father\'s side but is too late to save him as the arrow pierces him. Xerxes holds his father in his arms and locks eyes with Themistocles. The latter walks away, with Gorgo stating that he knew in his heart that he made a mistake not to kill Xerxes when he had the chance.\n\nDarius is returned to his kingdom to lie in his deathbed. He and Xerxes are joined by Artemisia (Eva Green), Darius\'s commanding naval officer, said to be as vicious as she is beautiful. She holds Darius\'s hand. In his dying moments, he tells Xerxes that it is best to leave the Greeks alone, for only the gods can defeat them. Artemisia pulls the arrow out of his chest to end his suffering. For a week, Xerxes sits and mourns the death of his father. On the eighth day, Artemisia holds Xerxes and tells him that his father\'s last words were not a warning, but a challenge. If only the gods can defeat the Greeks, then, she tells him, he is to become the god king.\n\nArtemisia has Xerxes sent into the desert wearing chains until he walks into a cave with a pool of bright gold liquid. Xerxes steps in, with, as Gorgo states, a dark desire for power and revenge. Xerxes emerges with a golden tinge and fiery red eyes, also hairless and a foot taller. Meanwhile, Artemisia kills off all of the former allies of the man that Xerxes used to be. He returns to Persia and stands before the citizens, with Artemisia right behind him. He declares, \"For glory\'s sake...WAR!\" The Persians cheer this on loudly.\n\nTen years later (in 480 BC), Xerxes makes plans to lead his army on land through Thermopylae while Artemisia is prepared to ready her navy at sea. The second Persian invasion of Greece begins.\n\nIn Athens, Themistocles meets with the council to discuss his own naval strategy for taking on the invading Persians. Although the Athenians want to desperately bring the Persians down, they are not keen on sending their men to sacrifice themselves in battle. Themistocles insists that it is in the best interests of Greece that they fight for the sake of freedom, and so he demands that he be brought the best ships to go into battle. He also tells the council he will seek help from the Spartans.\n\nThemistocles travels to Sparta to request help from King Leonidas and his army. He walks in on a training session where a group of Spartans beat down on one man as he tries to fight back. The man gets bloodied up good.. Themistocles encounters Dilios (David Wenham), who tells him that Leonidas has already begun to lead his men on foot, adding that he already dealt with the emissary sent from Persia. Queen Gorgo speaks with Themistocles to tell him that the Spartans do not share the same ideal of a free nation in the same way that he does.\n\nMeanwhile, a prisoner is brought before Artemisia on her ship. He chastises two of her guards for being Greeks working under a woman with Greek blood but a devotion to an enemy nation. Artemisia grabs her sword and says she may be Greek, but her heart is Persian. She decapitates the man and throws his head off the ship. She sees a soldier on the ship that she is unfamiliar with. \"Well, then, allow me to introduce myself\", he boasts, before killing off several Persians. He is Scyllias (Callan Mulvey), an Athenian soldier sent to spy on the Persians. He jumps into the sea and avoids being hit by the arrows of the Persians.\n\nScyllias, along with his son Calisto (Jack O\'Connell), reports back to Themistocles and his lieutenant Aekylos (Hans Matheson). Scyllias tells them that the Persians are being led at sea by Artemisia. It is believed that she is the sole survivor of an attack on her town.\n\nThrough a flashback, we learn of her background story. As a child, a helpless and terrified Artemisia watched tearfully as her mother and father were slaughtered right before her eyes. A soldier from the invading side, walks to Artemisia and kicks her square in the face. Over the years, the soldiers raped and abused the girl until they left her on the side of the streets for dead. She is found by the Persian emissary (Peter Mensah; the same one that Leonidas kicked into the bottomless pit in the previous \'300\' film) and is looked after by him. She planned to return to Greece when she was ready to watch it burn. Over time, the emissary trains Artemisia in combat. She proves to be quick and dangerous, and as an adult, she carries many severed heads of Darius\'s enemies and brings them to him, earning her the position of his general. Even with this knowledge in mind, Themistocles prepares his strategy for the battle. Aekylos points out that their small navy against the much larger Persian navy outnumbers them and that the mission is suicide. \"Such is the plan,\" Themistocles replies.\n\nIn the present, Themistocles, confident in his men, leads them all out to the Aegean Sea, where Artemisia is leading her navy. Her general Artaphernes (Ben Turner) tells her that General Bandari (Ashraf Barhom) has prepared his strategy to lead the ships against the Greeks (thus beginning the naval Battle of Artemisium). Themistocles stirs up confidence by encouraging the men to fight with those standing by their side. The Athenians ram their ships into the Persian ships, charging at them with full force and fury. This leads to another bloody fight with many Persians dying at the hands of the Athenians. Scyllias and Calisto fight side-by-side, with Calisto hurling his spears at the Persians.\n\nArtemisia, displeased with the results, has Bandari chained and thrown into the sea where he sinks to his watery grave. The generals think she is disappointed with the loss of her men, but she admits to being disappointed in them specifically. She ponders the thought of having somebody standing by her side.\n\nThe next day, the Athenians cause the Persians to sail their ships through a crevice, causing the leading ship to get stuck and have the other ships crash into it. From atop the cliffs, the Athenians jump in and continue to slaughter the Persians. The second general to lead them, Kashani (Christopher Scieueref) is killed by Themistocles. Scyllias sees Calisto jumping into the fight, but clearly not wanting to see his son get hurt. Artemisia watches from her ship, admiring Themistocles\'s tactics and command.\n\nArtaphernes rides a boat to the shores where the Athenians have set up camp to bring Themistocles onto Artemisia\'s barge. She commends his skill during the battle when she takes him into her private chambers. She asks him if there happens to be somebody back in Athens for whom he fights. Themistocles states that he has had no time for a family or children. Artemisia offers him a chance to join her so that he will not have to live with conflict or responsibility. The two of them then start having rough, passionate, and violent sex (which her guards can clearly hear). When Artemisia echoes her offer, Themistocles simply states no, and Artemisia angrily throws him off of her, hissing to him that he is no god, but merely a man. Themistocles returns to the camp, warning his men that Artemisia is prepared to bring hell to them.\n\nOn the next day of battle, the Persian ships release tar into the ocean, along with several guards swimming out to the Athenians with explosives strapped to their backs. The Athenians fight off the guards until Artemisia fires her arrows. The Persians hurl flaming arrows to ignite the tar. Artemisia fires more arrows, striking three into Scyllias as Calisto watches. On one of the Persian ships, a large Persian hurls torches to continue igniting the fires. He is struck with an arrow, and he drops the torch on himself, setting himself ablaze. He falls off the ship into the spilling tar, sending a wave of fire onto an Athenian ship, but also back onto the Persian ship, causing it to explode. Artemisia sends another flaming arrow to hit the back of a Persian with an explosive on his back, just as he climbs onto Themistocles\'s ship. He orders everyone to abandon ship and he lunges toward the Persian. Before he can strike him, the explosive goes off and destroys the ship, taking Themistocles down with it. Artemisia watches proudly as her enemy sinks. In the ocean, Themistocles sinks among the bodies of his fallen comrades. He sees two serpent-like creatures swim to them and devour them before one lunges at him.\n\nThemistocles is snapped out of this dream by Calisto. He realizes this event may have been brought upon him to subdue his ego or to remind him of the mistake of not killing Xerxes. Themistocles walks over to Scyllias\'s side as he is dying. He urges his friend to continue the fight and tells him something else before finally passing. Themistocles mourns his friend. Calisto asks Themistocles what his father\'s last words were, but Themistocles says he will tell him in time.\n\nMeanwhile on land, Xerxes and his army have just killed off Leonidas and his 300 Spartans after the brutal three-day Battle of Thermopylae (a brief flashback to the previous film). The birds pick at the eyes of the dead Spartans while the Persians continue marching onward victoriously towards Athens. The news of the defeat reaches Themistocles through a messenger. He returns to Sparta to confront Ephialtes (Andrew Tiernan), the deformed hunchback that betrayed the Spartans and sold them out to Xerxes. Seemingly remorseful for his actions, he does not cower when Themistocles lowers his sword to him, saying that there is little beauty in him, and even less in what he\'s done. Ephialtes adds that Xerxes is leading his army to Athens, preparing to destroy it. Themistocles leaves him alive so that he may carry the message back to the Persians saying that the Greeks will fight to the death.\n\nThemistocles goes to speak to Queen Gorgo. Dilios, now half-blind, warns him to not expect a warm welcome. Gorgo is still in mourning of her husband. Although Themistocles urges her to aid in the continuing battle, she refuses to send anymore husbands, fathers, and sons out to be sacrificed any further. He hands her the sword of Leonidas, saying it belongs with her. Gorgo tears up at the sight of it.\n\nThe Persian army takes Athens. Xerxes holds the head of Leonidas boastfully over the city as his men lay waste to the people and burn everything down. He continues to brag about his victory and states that Themistocles was nothing but a coward. Ephialtes returns to Xerxes and Artemisia to report that the Greeks are continuing to take their battle back into the sea, led again by Themistocles. Hearing his name and realizing he\'s not dead, Artemisia vows to end the Athenians once and for all. She leaves to prepare her command.\n\nThemistocles acknowledges that his men may be weary of continuing the fight, knowing they too would refuse to see anymore bloodshed. He encourages them to act for themselves and leave now if they wish so that they may maintain their freedom, but also encourages them to stay and fight. \"Let it be shown that we chose to die on our feet, rather than to live on our knees!\" The Athenians cheer.\n\nThe limited number of Athenian ships face the huge Persian fleet at the sea in their final battle. Themistocles tells Calisto his father\'s final words, which was to say that he has earned himself a place at the table (he\'s ready to fight). Once again, both Themistocles and Artemisia are set to lead their men into battle. The climatic naval Battle of Salamis begins. Their ships collide, and the Athenians charge against the Persians, fighting quickly and mercilessly. Not ready to stand idly by, Artemisia wields her two swords and fights against the Greeks, killing off as many as she can on her own.\n\nThemistocles rides his horse through the battle until he reaches Artemisia\'s ship. He reminds her of her earlier offer, stating that he still says no. Angered, she begins to fight him in a duel. He fights with great fury, and she quips that \"he fights harder than he fucks\". They continue to fight until they hold both their swords at each other\'s necks. Themistocles continues to refuse the idea of joining Artemisia, and he tells her that it is time for her to surrender.\n\nWe see Gorgo leading her army of Spartans, having been telling them the story from the beginning, leading into her own rousing speech as they come closer to surrounding the Persian fleet. In addition, armies from other allied nations join in the fight. Themistocles points this out to Artemisia as he still has her with his sword to her throat. He urges her to surrender. She chooses not to, and she grabs her sword to kill, but Themistocles quickly drives his sword into her stomach. Artemisia drops to her knees. In her final moments, she watches as the allied forces surround her navy. Xerxes, watching from the cliff side, turns his back on her. Artemisia finally collapses, dead, just as Gorgo and Dilios step onto her ship to stand by Themistocles.\n\nThe film ends with the Spartans and Athenians banding together to defeat the Persians once and for all. It was later recorded in history that the naval Battle of Salamis was one of the most decisive battles of the ancient world and the allied Athenian-Spartan victory forced the Persians to retreat from Greece for good.',843,110000000,'US',337580051),(100,'3:15 the Moment of Truth','1986-01-31',86,0,'Violent crime is routine. Organized drug trade runs rampant in the face of powerless authority. And a vicious street gang holds dominion with a savage reign of terror. Welcome to Lincoln High! Here the cobras rule the school and everyone in it. Everyone except for Jeff Hanna.','The Cobras are the toughest gang around, led by Jeff Hanna (Adam Baldwin) and Cinco (Danny De La Paz). The film opens with the Cobras attacking a rival gang for hanging out on their turf. The rival gang flees and the Cobras turn their attention to a wounded member and proceed to beat him. Jeff tries to intervene but Cinco kills the member. Disgusted, Jeff leaves the gang. Cinco shouts after Jeff, calling him a traitor.\n\nOne year later at Lincoln High. Jeff has cleaned up his act (with the help of the faculty clearing his record) and now plays basketball and dates fellow student Sherry Hallivand (Deborah Foreman). The Cobras practically rule the school, intimidating the students whilst selling drugs to them. Each morning, the Cobras take money from the students then put drugs in their lockers during third period.\n\nThat particular morning, Principal Horner (Rene Auberjonois) has had enough of being unable to control the students and calls Detective Moran (Ed Lauter) to organize a drug bust. During third period, the Cobras begin to distribute drugs when the police arrive and chase them around the school. Several of the gang members get away while others are arrested. Cinco and another member are cornered in the mens\' locker room where Jeff happens to be. Cinco tries to hand off the drugs to Jeff but he refuses and Cinco is immediately arrested. Cinco says the drugs are Jeff\'s and is dragged out, swearing revenge.\n\nRumors begin flying around school, ranging from Jeff narcing on the Cobras to Jeff attacking Cinco. Jeff is unfazed, believing this whole mess to be stupid and simply wants to live his life. In jail, Cinco is furious that Jeff turned him, now his pride is ruined.\n\nAfter basketball practice, Jeff spends the night at Sherry\'s house. Sherry begs Jeff not to get involved with the Cobras again. Jeff assures her he\'s not fighting anyone.\n\nThe next day, Jeff is hailed as a hero amongst some students and as a pariah amongst others, particularly the Corbettes, the girlfriends of the Cobras. A few of the Cobras have been released from jail, much to Horner\'s dismay. Moran explains that the Cobras won\'t be given a heavy sentence and will soon be released. Horner wants them out of the school, in order to set example. Jeff is called down to the office. The two men try to convince Jeff to testify against Cinco but Jeff refuses. Horner reminds Jeff he cleaned up his record so he could play basketball, so Jeff owes him. Jeff angrily says he doesn\'t want to be involved and storms out. Horner is determined to get the Cobras out of the school, even if it means they kill Jeff.\n\nIn the hallway, Ponch (Jeb Ellis-Brown), one of the Cobras, calls Jeff a narc and shoots him with a water pistol. Jeff pulls Sherry out of class and tells her that he has a bad feeling about what\'s going to happen and that he feels unlucky. Sherry assures him he\'s not. Later, Sherry is intimitated by the Corbettes but is saved by Lora (Wendy Barry), Cinco\'s girlfriend and Jeff\'s ex. Lora tells Sherry that she needs to meet with Jeff at a local club to tell him something important about Cinco.\n\nJim (John Scott Clough) and Chris (Scott McGinnis), Jeff\'s best friends, tell Jeff that the Cobras are planning something. Chris thinks they should attack first but Jim is reluctant. Jeff assures them that the Cobras are all talk.Later in the gym, Jeff is harassed by Smiley (Jesse Aarogon) and two other members. Despite their taunts, Jeff doesn\'t fight back.\n\nAt lunch, Chris still argues that they should fight back. Norman (Joseph Brutsman), a student who was bullied by the Cobras earlier, agrees. Sherry becomes disgusted and walks away. When Whitey (Bradford Bancroft) harasses her, she slaps him and he grabs her. Suddenly, Jeff leaps onto him and begins to beat him up until Coach Draper (Wayne Crawford) separates them. Sherry runs off and when Jeff catches up to her, she tells him about Lora and that he enjoys this gang stuff. Jeff tries to convince her he never lied to her but she is adament and tells him she never wants to see him again.\n\nIn the bathroom, Jeff confronts Ponch and tells him to give Cinco a message: Is he ready to go to war? In the gym, Coach Draper tells Jeff that Horner has told the D.A. to expect a murder charge and Jeff might be the victim. Despite Draper\'s assurances, Jeff says he\'s alone in this matter.\n\nAt the club, Jeff meets up with Lora. Lora offers sex but Jeff refuses. Cinco has gotten Jeff\'s message and he\'s going to kill him, along with Sherry. Jeff is disgusted that Cinco wants revenge over something petty. When Lora heads back to the club, she is cornered by the Corbettes who proceed to violently beat her. Jeff calls Sherry and warns her that the Cobras are targeting her and she should stay home from school tomorrow. Sherry ignores his warning and reminds Jeff about his promise.\n\nThe next day, Cinco and the rest of the gang are released from jail. The school announces a half day, saying the grounds will be closed around 3. Jeff is horrified to see that Sherry has come to school. Meanwhile, Chris is antagonized by Smiley who tells him that Cinco wants the fight at school and Jeff will find out the time later. Jeff begs Horner to get Sherry off the grounds but Horner argues that Sherry will be safe in class. His opinion changes however when he recieves a call that Lora has been beaten up and in the hospital. He sends another student to fetch Sherry.\n\nSherry is ambushed in the hallways by the Corbettes and is dragged to the bathroom where she is beaten. Jeff arrives and saves her. As he consoles her, he sees \'3:15\' spraypainted on the mirror. Sherry is rushed to the hospital and Jeff realizes he has no choice but to face Cinco. Jim and Chris promise to stand by him. Coach Draper tries to convince Horner to remove Jeff from school but Horner ignores him. At the hospital, Jeff reconciles with Sherry.\n\nJeff and the Cobras prepare for the fight. Unbeknownst to Jeff, Cinco has a gun on him. Jeff arrives at the school and discovers Jim and Chris have bailed on him. He tries to get the other cliques to join in but no luck. Seeing he\'s alone, Jeff goes inside the school while the Cobras break in. Sherry steals her mother\'s car keys and leaves the hospital. Chooch (Panchito Gómez) attacks Jeff in the weight room but Jeff easily overpowers him.\n\nThe Cobras corner Jeff in the locker room and incapacitate him. Cinco angrily tells Jeff he betrayed him and now he\'s going to pay. Suddenly Norman arrives, armed with a baseball bat. When Cinco tries to intimidate him, Norman hits him. Cinco retaliates by shooting him. Jeff quickly disarms the other members as Cinco and Ponch escape into the school. Norman is wounded but still alive. Jeff promises to return with help.\n\nCinco hands Ponch a switchblade and orders him to kill Jeff. Ponch refuses (just like Jeff did last year) and is promptly killed by Cinco. Jeff and Cinco reach a stand off that ends with Cinco shooting Jeff. The cops arrive and Cinco yells from the window that he\'s won. Jeff slowly crawls up the stairs as Cinco stands over him, gun ready.\n\nSherry appears and pushes Cinco down the stairs. The two former friends wrestle for the gun. Jeff unleashes everything onto Cinco and gets the gun but tosses it aside. When Cinco tries to attack again, he knocks him out. Jeff sighs that it\'s finally over.\n\nJeff, Sherry and Norman exit the school where Norman is promptly taken to the hospital. Horner pulls Jeff aside and tells him he\'s glad he won and asks if they can bury the hatchet. Jeff slugs him in response. The film ends with an exhausted Jeff embracing Sherry.',1317,0,'US',0);
