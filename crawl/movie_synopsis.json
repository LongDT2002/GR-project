    "\"Mitchell\"!": "The movie opens with title and credits and the Mitchell theme over stills of Mitchell (we will see this was the death of one of the Dune Buggy drivers later in the movie). It is late evening at the Walter Deaney lavish residence. No one is home and a burglar (John Ashby) breaks in through the French door to the study. Enroute home in his limo is Walter Deaney (John Saxon) and friends: two hookers and a public official are heading back to the house to continue the party. The burglar steals some silverware and looks over the gun case as the limo pulls onto the long driveway to the house. The blonde, Helena Jackman (Vicky Peters) and brunette, Prudence Lang (Carole Estes) hookers are left in the living room while Deaney and Don Townsend (Bill Sullivan) go to get something in another room. Deaney spots a light and hears the burglar in the study. Rather than call the police as Don suggests, he decides to take matters into his own hands. He sets a trap and gets a gun from a hallway drawer. When the burglar comes into the hallway to investigate, Deaney shoots him in the chest, killing him.\n\nA patrol car, carrying Mitchell (Joe Don Baker) in the backseat, responds to a police call at the Deaney residence. When they arrive, a private security patrol walks over to greet them. Mitchell joins the two patrolmen in the investigation. Deaney explains to the patrolman what happened. We see a firearm next to the body of the burglar. Mitchell picks up the hand gun with a pencil and places it in a plastic evidence bag. He asks Deaney if all the guns in the case are loaded. He pulls one from high in the case and check it and notices that Don and the two hookers are leaving. Mitchell activates the gate and closes it before the car can leave the property. He trots out to the limo while Deaney makes a phone call. The crime lab has arrived and tapes off the body and photographs the scene. Mitchell resumes his examination of the gun case contents.\n\nIt is Christmas time and Police Chief Albert Pallin (Robert Phillips) enters the station. Mitchell is waiting for him in his office. The two men don't like each other. Mitchell has refused to sign the report on the death at the Deaney residence. Mitchell suspects Deaney is lying and that the death of the burglar was murder. Pallin warns Mitchell not to bother Deaney and to see Det. Aldridge (Buck Young) for his next assignment. Mitchell must watch one James Arthur Cummings (Martin Balsam) on a 24-hour surveillance. Det. Tyzack (Rayford Barnes) takes Mitchell to the Cummings residence and briefs him. He tells Mitchell that Cummings specializes in the import of stolen merchandise, and this week it is Heroin from Mexico: a full kilo. Mitchell vows to get both Deaney and Cummings, but Tyzack disagrees, \"No way, you don't get neither.\" Mitchell gets in his car and waits for Cummings to come home. He doesn't have long to wait. Benton (Merlin Olsen) is Cummings' bodyguard and driver and pulls up and opens the car door for his boss. Mitchell trots up the driveway and introduces himself. Cummings dismisses the cop telling him, \"Benefit's not due until January, son. Make an appointment, son, and have your chief give me a ring.\" Benton tartly adds, \"No salesmen at this entrance.\" Mitchell walks back to his car to begin a long day. He lights up a cigarette. He empties out the ashtray as Benton watches from the house. Cummings approaches the driver's open window and asks, \"All right. Now what do you want?\" Mitchell asks about Mistretta and the Heroin shipment from Mexico. Cummings denies any knowledge and warns Mitchell about falling rocks. At midnight Mitchell drives to the Deaney home and Cummings calls Mistretta. A short time later Salvatore Mistretta (Morgan Paull) picks Cummings up at his home. They drive and talk. Cummings wants the dope shipped somewhere else. Mr. Gallano apparently approved of both the shipment and using Cummings' facilities without informing Cummings. Mitchell calls in to report he is at the Deaney residence and he is going inside unarmed. He makes entry the same as the burglar and notes he couldn't reach the handguns, if like the burglar, he was only 5'4\" tall. Deaney is home and catches sight of the detective. A car headlight reveals Deaney and Mitchell runs back to his car. Mitchell returns to headquarters and he and Tyzack are going through the file room. Chief Pallin enters the room and orders Tyzack out. Pallin explains the Feds have been investigating Deaney and his trade union activities, so leave him alone. Mitchell returns home and is reviewing the Cummings file when someone comes to the door. It is Greta (Linda Evans), a very high priced hooker. She introduces herself as Mitchell's \"new friend\". He invites her in and offers her a drink. He manages to spill a beer on her legs. She explains that she is a Christmas present, but she won't tell Mitchell who is paying. Mitchell empties her purse and finds nothing but her ID. She leaves.\n\nThe next day, Mitchell follows Cummings to the park. Cummings meets with Tony Gallano (Harold J. Stone) and again makes it clear he will not participate in the Heroin shipment. The short meeting ends and Mitchell follows Cummings car. Cummings stops and gets out to talk to Mitchell. He makes it clear he does not want to be bothered by the policeman. Assuming Mitchell would say no, Cummings and Benton arrange for a reception on a dirt road. An orange Mustang, driven by Benton's friend (Alan Gibbs) runs Mitchell off the road destroying Mitchell's car. Mitchell does manage to get the license number. He intends to deal with this person on his own terms.\n\nCummings calls his friend Rudy Moran (Sidney Clute) in Las Vegas. He explains the situation, hoping for a little assistance, but Rudy tells Cummings, \"What the hell are you calling me for? If Gallano's involved, I don't want any part of it.\" Mitchell picks up a new car and sees Cummings parked near the station. He drives up and parks next to a yellow Plymouth with three men inside. Mitchell gets out and walks over to the deli where Cummings is buying some food. He steps on Benton's foot on the way. As Cummings gets back into his car, the yellow Plymouth drives by and snaps the back door off the Lincoln. Mitchell walks back to his car and gets a call on the details about the Mustang driver. Mitchell drives over to the address and waits. He spots the driver pulling the battered orange car into the garage. Mitchell pulls up and gets out of his car. Before the man can retrieve a weapon from the passenger's side of the Mustang, Mitchell grabs him, hits him twice, and then kicks the door shut on the guy's hand. The man screams in pain, and Mitchell tells him, \"Shut up, you'll wake up the neighbors.\" He takes the man's gun and leaves.\n\nMitchell is at his desk at the station reviewing pictures of the Cummings case. Aldridge demands Mitchell bring in at least one man tailing Cummings. Cummings is out playing golf, Benton is acting as caddy. Mitchell watches from his car. A man from the yellow Plymouth gets out and approaches Cummings. Mitchell gets out of his car to observe. He talks to the man and is brushed off. Edmondo Bocca (Duffy Hambleton) runs towards Cummings, so Mitchell shoots him in the leg. He disarms the bleeding hood and hands the man's gun to Cummings. He tells Cummings, \"I've got to go call headquarters.\" The two men in the yellow Plymouth observe the scene and then drive off. Aldridge confronts Mitchell outside the police station. Mitchell reminds Aldridge he wanted the man for two weeks and no bail and got it.\n\nMitchell joins Cummings at his home for dinner. Benton acts as cook and butler. Cummings tries to impart some advice, but Mitchell asks about the Heroin. Cummings does volunteer that Bocca works for Mistretta. Cummings and Brenton get into an argument over the cold coffee. Mitchell drives home and gets beaten up by the two men in the Plymouth working for Mistretta. A night with Greta helps. Mitchell again asks Greta who is paying her and she refuses to answer. Mitchell tells her that he just wants to know who is paying her. She responds, \"So why does that bother you, you're not paying for it...You couldn't afford me...$1,000 a night.\" Greta makes coffee and Mitchell again goes through her purse. He finds marijuana and he arrests her after she accuses him of being a crooked cop. He hands over the bag of grass to the Desk Sergeant (Jerry Hardin) and waits for her booking. Mitchell tells Greta, \"It's only a $500 fine. At a $1000 per night, you're still ahead.\" \"Oh, you're a mean bastard, Mitchell,\" she tartly replies. \"I had a clean record in this town.\" Mitchell proudly confirms for the Desk Sergeant that he enjoyed her company, and then leaves the building.\n\nThe next day, Mitchell is still on surveillance. Greta is parked behind him. Cummings tells Benton to invite Mitchell into the house. Cummings comes to the point, \"I want to put you on the payroll.\" He concedes he needs help, \"I want to buy your services.\" While Mitchell takes notes of the bribe, Greta bangs into Mitchell's car. She writes \"Bastard\" on the windshield with her lipstick. Cummings continues, \"It could be open, cash, or subtle just like you take it from other people.\" On the subject of the hooker, Cummings notes, \"She's too expensive, you can't afford her on a policeman's salary. Now someone's picking up the check, who could that be?\" Mitchell tells Cummings it is him, but Cummings corrects the detective, \"No, I don't. I don't pay for your whores, Mitchell.\" Mitchell asks, \"Then who is?\" Cummings laughs and responds, \"You mean you don't know? You're a cop, and you don't know?\" Mitchell storms out of the house and drives over to see Deaney. \"I knew you'd call sooner or later,\" Deaney tells Mitchell. Deaney admits he admires Mitchell and adds, \"How's the broad?\" He offers to set up a company and transfer property with a $75,000 profit for Mitchell. Mitchell responds, \"I'm gonna bust you for the murder of the Mexican, or die trying.\" Deaney warns Mitchell that that would be a big mistake.\n\nAt the Indian Dunes Motor Recreation Park, Mitchell follows Cummings into the lot. Deaney is driving a Dune Buggy and talks to Cummings and suggest murder as a solution to their mutual problem. The limo departs and Mitchell follows. Cummings gets out of his car and sits in Mitchell's car. He offers Mitchell Walter Deaney, but Mitchell counteroffers that he will get Cummings first, and then he'll get Deaney on his own. Benton pulls a gun and takes Mitchell's gun. Cummings and Benton drive off. Cummings explains to Benton that if Deaney kills Mitchell, then Cummings will have more cops protecting him from Mistretta. They drive to the track and Mitchell gets stuck in the mud. He gets out and is soon menaced by Deaney in one of two Dune Buggies. They toy with Mitchell, who is on foot. Mitchell grabs a rock and kills one driver who got stuck. Mitchell gets in the Dune Buggy and goes after Deaney in the other. Deaney manages to flip his vehicle and it bursts into flames. Mitchell gets out and stares at the burning wreckage. He lights a cigarette and watches.\n\nMitchell heads home for the night. The next day he is driving back to the Cummings residence. A radio broadcast announces the death of Walter Deaney. Mitchell honks the horn and Cummings comes to the window. A little boy (Todd Bass) approaches the car on a skateboard. He annoys Mitchell to the point where Mitchell tells the kid to piss off and go to hell. Cummings confronts Mitchell at his car and asks Mitchell why he hasn't been arrested. Mitchell tells Cummings he wants the whole crew, Mistretta, Gallano, and the Heroin. Cummings invites him in to the house and tells him what happened with the shipment. He offers to set up everything and hand it over to Mitchell, but he only gets the Heroin and Mistretta. Cummings emphasizes that he is not part of the deal. Mitchell agrees and acts as chauffeur and drives to the docks in Long Beach. The Kef Falcon has unloaded and a customs officer (Rob Narke) wheels a steamer trunk out to the waiting car. The Rich Old Lady (Lillian McBride) signs for it. Mitchell loads the case into the trunk of the car and drives off. They are observed by Benton who calls Cummings from a phone booth. Cummings then calls Mistretta and tells him about Mitchell and the consignment. He plans to take his boat out and knows Mistretta will kill Mitchell. He thinks he's solved his problems. Cummings makes one final call to the police. He reports that Mitchell will be going to see Mistretta and might need some help. Mitchell stops the Cadillac and checks for the heroin in the trunk. He tells the old lady that it is just chalk and she should just walk away from the whole mess. He concludes that Cummings is double-crossing Mistretta and Gallano. Before he drives off, Mitchell stuffs a rag into the gas filler tube on the car. He prepares the car as a bomb if need be. He then drives up to Calabasas and his rendezvous with Mistretta.\n\nCummings and Benton get on the boat and pull out to sea. They are heading to Mexico. Mitchell drives to Mistretta's home. Mistretta and his henchman greet Mitchell. Mitchell feigns surprise at the double-cross. Mistretta reveals that he is going to kill Mitchell and put him on Cummings' boat. Mitchell manages to blow up the car and escape Mistretta and his men, at least initially. A police helicopter provides Mitchell a gun and he kills Mistretta and his three men. The helicopter pilot (Charles A. Tamburro) and the officer (Gary Combs) fly Mitchell to Marina del Rey and land so Mitchell can talk to the Harbor Master. They depart and head south for Mexico looking for the Cummings boat.\n\nThe officer explains they have a fuel issue and if the boat crosses into Mexican waters they cannot arrest them. Mitchell asks about the large yellow tank they are carrying. The officer ties the rope to the tank and winch. Mitchell intends to use the tank as a battering ram on the boat. It works and Mitchell is able to distract Benton and Cummings long enough to drop down on to the boat. Mitchell manages to dispatch Benton with a boat hook. He tosses Benton's body overboard. He disables the engine. Cummings tries to make a final plea to Mitchell with a half-million dollar bribe. In a scene right out of Key Largo, Cummings feigns disarming himself and surrendering, but Mitchell is in no mood for an arrest. When Cummings turns to face him, armed of course, Mitchell drops him to the deck with a rifle bullet to the forehead.\n\nThat night, a dead tired Mitchell goes home. He thinks his place has been burglarized and enters with his gun drawn. Greta is in his bed sleeping. He pulls her out and searches the apartment. They are alone. He asks how she got in. She shows him a key. Mitchell is horrified by the mess in the kitchen. He asks her to leave. He takes a shower while Greta cleans up the kitchen. He goes to bed, and Greta asks to join him. He sarcastically chides her, \"What for? Nobody paying you this time.\" He smells marihuana, \"That's grass.\" He finds a roach in the kitchen trashcan and grabs her and tells her to get her coat. He intends to arrest her again. We close with a freeze frame of Mitchell dragging Greta out of bed. Closing credits roll with the Mitchell theme playing."

    "#Alive": "Oh Joon-woo (Yoo Ah-in) awakens and discovers he is alone at home. His parents left that morning in a hurry leaving him money for groceries. Oh Joon-woo is a gamer and is online with some of his gaming friends when he first hears about the strange disease that causes infected people to bite and even eat uninfected people thereby infecting them. When Oh Joon-woo turns on the television, he is surprised to see how chaotic the country is. As he reaches his balcony, Joon-woo sees a chaotic and panicked crowd fleeing and running for their lives. Pandemonium is breaking out. Traffic accidents are numerous. Oh Joon-woo notices a girl calling out for her mother. When her mother finds the girl, their embrace become a violent attack as the girl starts to devour her mother.\n\nBack inside again, Oh Joon-woo hears similar noises in the hallway. As soon as he opens the door to the hallway, a neighbor named Lee Sang-chul (Lee Hyun-wook) from the next apartment barges in. Sang-chul begs Joon-woo to let him stay. Joon-woo allows him to use the bathroom. A TV report describes the transformation infected individuals experience including aggressive behavior and bleeding of the eyes that can ultimately lead to full out cannibalistic assaults. When the neighborhood exits the bathroom, Joon-woo notice a wound on his neighbor's hand. Shortly thereafter, Sang-chul's eyes turns red and his body convulses. Joon-woo pushes his neighbor back out of the apartment and into the hallway and locks the door to save his own life. Through the peephole, Joon-woo obverse a hideous murder in the hallway. Blood seeps under the door into his apartment. Joon-woo secures the front door by pushing his refrigerator in front of it.\n\nOh Joon-woo receives messages from his family assuring him that they are safe. He checks his food supply and regrets of not going to the grocery the day before. He dedicates himself to survival. As night has fallen, Joon-woo falls asleep on the couch. The next day, Oh Joon-woo is awakened by a TV discussion of professor Kim Yeon-jeong of the causes of the behavioral changed attributed to a mutated viral infection. The professor states that there seems to be a connection to the right brain which is the source the very aggressive behaviors observed.\n\nThe internet, as Joon-woo soon finds out, is filled with people asking about their loved ones and putting up addresses under the #Alive. Seeking his own rescue, Joon-woo puts up a similar post. He also comes across a disturbing video of a rather stupid young man, who is hanging outside the terrace of a multiple story building with his phone attached to a selfie stick in a bid to get a signal. The young man is excited when gets a signal only to lose it soon after. He then stretches on tiptoes, loses his footing and falls from his perch.\n\nJoon-woo sends out his drone to get a brief glimpse of the terror going on in the apartments around him before his cell phone battery dies. Then he even loses the connection to his streaming video game service. He falls asleep but is awakened by a commotion outside. From his deck, Joon-woo observes a policewoman (Oh Hye-won) being torn to bits by fellow police officers now turned into zombies. Joon-woo shouts at the predators out of sympathy, but the policewoman is overwhelmed. Joon-woo's attempt to scare off the zombies nearly 100 meters away by yelling at them does nothing but to attract the attention of a zombie close to his home. Almost immediately, a zombie pushes his way past the refrigerator and into Joon-woo's apartment. Joon-woo is outside the railing hanging off his lanai when the zombie rushes him and falls several stories to the pavement below. Although Oh Joon-woo is unharmed, it seems that his encounter with the zombie has further reduced his rations. The little food in the fridge has all found its way to the bloody mess on the floor.\n\nAfter two days alone, Joon-woo records a video of his nearly miraculous survival for his subscribers. By Day 7, Joon-woo has invaded his father's liquor cabinet. TV news further details that the virus seems to be only spread by contact with the blood. Avoiding bites and stabs is the best way to stay free of contamination. The infected get a superior sense of strength and sensory capabilities. Many still possess the ability to perform behaviors they had before infection such as opening doors and windows or performing their occupations. Joon-woo eats his last bowl of Ramen soup. Joon-woo spills his water bottle and then discovers there is no running water in his apartment.\n\nBy Day 10, Joon-woo is frustrated by the advisory on the television stating that survivors should simply wait it out at home. He refuses to leave the apartment and end up like the infected. He recalls his mother listened to internet radio shows. His attempt to listen to the radio on his phone is foiled when he cannot find any wired earphones to serve as an antenna. All his earphones are wireless.\n\nBy Day 15, Joon-woo hallucinates that he is reuniting with his family. Waking up from the hallucination, he is left very sad. He gets a call from his mother, but the signal is so bad he barely hears a thing. He then duplicates the stunt the stupid young man on the internet had pulled earlier using a selfie stick to get better reception. He does not fall, but he clearly hears that something is not quite right with his family.\n\nIn his anger, Oh Joon-woo breaks things in his home and goes outside. There, he sees a zombie that is surprisingly slow, and he takes out his anger on the zombie using a golf club. The violence urges others to come by. Not too long after he is nearly swamped in a sea of zombies. Joon-woo manages to get to his apartment alive when zombies exiting the elevator pile up against the zombies pursuing Joon-woo down the corridor. Then Joon-woo quietly walks behind the zombies until he arrives at his front door. Once Jun-woo is behind the locked door, the zombies gather outside.\n\nBy Day 20, Joon-woo decides that it is time to take his own life. As he dangles from the noose he has tied, a laser beam projects into his house from the apartment across the yard. The beam points to the word \"NO\" on the writing on the wall. He struggles with the noose until he is freed. Joon watches the beam then point to different alphabets on the writings on the wall to spell the word, IDIOT. (Someone is finally saying it). The source of the laser beam is a girl on the lanai opposite his. Kim Yoo-bin (Park Shin-hye), seems to have been watching Joon-woo with a pair of binoculars. When Joon-woo, now freed from the noose, sees her, he waves to her excitedly. She waves back and gestures that meet again at seven o'clock.\n\nUnlike Oh Joon-woo, Kim Yoo-bin seems very organized and has prepared her house with a series of booby traps for zombies. Joon-woo wakes up at eleven o'clock, late for the seven o'clock rendezvous time they had previously agreed on. Joon-woo gestures an apology and then projects his name on his phone. She reciprocates. After their brief attempt to communicate Kim Yoo-bin hears a sound and attempts to find the source. They agree to meet at seven o'clock again. One of Kim Yoo-bin's traps has snared a zombie that made its way into her house. She proceeds to axe its head off.\n\nThe next morning, at the agreed upon time, Yoo-bin attempts to pass food over to Joon-woo when she sees that he is hungry. She attaches a rope to a baseball and throws it across hoping it gets into his home. The ball does not make it and it lands in the street. Oh Joon-woo then uses his drone to deliver a rope to Kim Yoo-bin. Using the rope bridge, she passes him a container of snacks and a bottle of water with the encouragement not to eat too fast. An infected firefighter pulls on the first cable, causing Yoo-bin's table to fly across her apartment, knocking her out, and lodge into her balcony railing. The zombie starts climbing the cable. Joon-woo distracts the zombie with his drone ultimately sacrificing it. Shortly thereafter, Yoo-bin wakes up and cuts off the hand of the infected man as her reaches her lanai. The zombie falls to his death. Joon-woo flashes a message to Yoo-bin on his phone to \"Stay Strong\".\n\nViewing his meager supplies and quite desperate, Joon-woo decides to \"go farming\". Leaving his apartment, he finds the key to his neighbor's door on a dead body. Joon-woo cleans out the refrigerator and finds other food, clothing, a headphone with a cord and walkie-talkies inside his neighbor's unit. While searching for other items, an infected sleeping zombie wake ups and attacks Joon-woo. Joon-woo manages to save himself and bring the essentials to his apartment.\n\nAfter feasting on the peanut butter he found and unsuccessfully finding a radio station with his antenna cord, Joon-woo sends a walkie-talkie and some food to Yoo-bin on the zip line. The two communicate through it. With the talkies, they eventually start to communicate. Yoo-bin is not interested in discussing Joon-woo's suicide attempt. Instead, they decide to make noodle soup together. Later Yoo-bin admits she is scared of heights. Joon-woo finds it illogical that she has such a fear and was still able to cut off someone's hand. Yoo-bin says the monsters are no longer human which relieves her of any guilt or fear. She tells Joon-woo that she fell while climbing.\n\nWhile they talk, Jun-woo asks Yoo-bin to bring out basins as he can hear heavy sounds and thinks it's raining. They look out the terraces, but it is not raining. Instead, they see a multitude of zombies running into both apartment complexes simultaneously. They both lie low and try to stay silent until Yoo-bin accidentally knocks over a shelf in her house. Joon-woo calls a neighboring unit on the phone to momentarily distract the zombies in front of Yoo-bin's apartment. Yoo-bin prepares to leave as she knows she would soon be overrun with zombies. She informs Joon-woo that her destination is the 8th floor of his apartment complex which, as she had earlier noticed, was empty. They both agree to meet up there.\n\nYoo-bin jumps out of the terrace of her home, repels down to the street and runs towards the apartment complex across the way swinging her axe to fight off numerous zombies. Joon-woo is very impressed by her bravery and runs out to help her. He knocks a zombie off the top of Yoo-bin with his golf club. They both narrowly miss being swamped by zombies as they enter the elevator to the 8th floor. They meet face to face for the first time.\n\nAs they cautiously exit the elevator, all is peaceful on the 8th floor. This lasts a few moments while they are checking for unlocked doors. Soon they are again chased by zombies. Joon-woo fights them off with a golf club while Yoo-bin finds an unlocked door. A man (Jaon Bae-soo) opens his door and quickly pulls them in before the Joon-woo and Yoo-bin are bitten and eaten. Once inside, they all share their stories of survival.\n\nThe man seems kind and offers them water and food. He says he has enough for them to survive until a rescue team comes around. They are overjoyed but it seems their joy is short lived as they soon discover that the food was laced with drugs. The man zip ties their wrists while they slumber. He locks Yoo-bin in a room with a sky painted on the ceiling.\n\nYoo-bin wakes up under a mobile in a locked room. The man is planning to offer Yoo-bin as a meal to his starving wife (Lee Chae-kyung) now turned zombie. Yoo-bin realizes that she's in danger and cries for help. Joon-woo wakes up and threatens the older man with a gun they previously had recovered outside. The man holds the wife's harness telling Joon-woo keeping his wife alive is something he must do. He offers to let Joon-woo survive of he just abandons Yoo-bin. When Joon-woo threatens to kill the man, he releases the tether holding back his wife. Joon-woo leaps toward the tether but it has mostly slips away under the door. Sounds of an attack are heard and then the room goes silent. The older man opens the door to see what is going on. Yoo-bin manages to save herself by pulling the fabric over the infected wife's head. The older man, submits himself to his wife attack. Yoo-bin shoots them both with the gun.\n\nThe gunfire only draws the attention of more zombies. Seeing the end so close, Joon-woo and Yoo-bin decide to shoot themselves instead of getting bit and become infected. Just before Joon-woo pulls the trigger on his partner, they hear the rescue helicopters. With hope rekindled in them, they struggle hard to make it to the rooftop of the apartment building. The use a push cart to clear a path through the zombies. Then Joon-woo holds off a hoard of zombies in the stair well with a bicycle while Yoo-bin escapes to the roof. Joon-woo eventually pushes the zombies backward giving himself enough time and distance to join Yoo-bin on the roof. The choppers, however, are no longer in sight.\n\nJun-woo screams at the sky, \"There are survivors here! We are still alive!\" The zombies find their way to the rooftop, push open the door and they gradually creep closer and closer to Joon-woo and Yoo-bin. Just when they are about to overwhelmed by the zombies, the military appear in a helicopter and shoot at the zombies while helping the survivors into the chopper. Once aboard and flying to safety, Joon-woo receives a message from his family assuring him of their safety. He looks towards Yoo-bin and they are both glad to be alive. A news report details how valuable posting on social media has been in locating survivors in the urban areas. The reference on Joon-woo 's social media posting changes from #I_MUST_SURVIVE to #ALIVE."

    "'71": "Set in 1971, Gary Hook, a new recruit to the British Army, takes leave of his much younger brother Darren. Hook's platoon is sent to Belfast, Ulster during in the early years of the Troubles. Under the leadership of the inexperienced Second Lieutenant Armitage, his platoon is deployed to a volatile area where Catholic Nationalists and Protestant Loyalists live side by side. The unit provides support for the Royal Ulster Constabulary as it inspects homes for firearms, shocking Hook with their rough treatment of women and children. A crowd gathers to protest and provoke the British troops who, though heavily armed, can only respond by trying to hold the crowd back with non-lethal force.\n\nOne soldier is hit by a rock and drops his rifle to the ground. In the confusion, a young boy seizes it and runs off through the mob. Hook and another soldier, Thompson, pursue him. As the crowd's protest violently escalates, the soldiers and police pull out, leaving the two soldiers behind. Hook and Thompson are severely beaten by a mob, until a sympathetic woman manages to calm things down. However, Thompson is suddenly shot dead at point blank range by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) gunman Paul Haggerty. With the crowd physically attacking him, Hook flees through streets and back alleys, eludes his pursuers, and hides in an outhouse until dark.\n\nA Protestant youngster brings Hook to a local pub that serves as a front for Loyalists. There, Hook glimpses a Loyalist group in a back room, constructing a bomb under the guidance of a member of the Military Reaction Force (MRF), the British Army's covert counter-insurgency unit. Hook steps outside the pub just before an enormous explosion destroys the building, killing or injuring many of those inside, including the young boy who brought him there. Hook flees once more into the dark streets. Unaware that the Loyalist bombers have blown themselves up accidentally, the PIRA and Official Irish Republican Army (OIRA) factions accuse each other of being responsible for the bombing.\n\nTwo Catholics, Eamon and his daughter Brigid, discover Hook as he lies in a street unconscious and injured by shrapnel. They take him to their home in the Divis Flats area before discovering he is a British soldier. Eamon, a former army medic, stitches Hook's wounds.\n\nDespite the PIRA's having recently taken control of the area from the OIRA, Eamon contacts senior OIRA official Boyle for help, expecting a more humane solution than the PIRA faction would allow. Boyle, less radical and violent than the younger PIRA members, has a working relationship with the MRF and tells MRF Captain Browning, leader of the local MRF section, of Hook's whereabouts and asks in return that Browning kill James Quinn, a key leader of the PIRA faction.\n\nMeanwhile, Quinn and his PIRA squad have been tailing Boyle since the pub explosion and saw him visit Eamon's flat without knowing why he was there. Sensing danger, Hook flees the flat, taking an assault knife he finds in a bag. He eludes the PIRA men but, unable to evade Haggerty, Hook stabs and kills him.\n\nQuinn's group captures Hook and takes him to a hideout. Quinn orders Sean, a young teenager, to murder Hook. When Sean hesitates, Quinn prepares to execute Hook himself, only to leave when Browning's group arrives. Sergeant Lewis of Browning's group shoots Sean, to Hook's horror. Lewis then attempts to strangle Hook to prevent him from informing others about the bomb.\n\nAs Lieutenant Armitage and his men enter in support of Browning, Armitage sees Lewis' attempt to kill Hook. Sean raises himself and shoots Lewis dead before being shot again, this time by Armitage. Browning finds Quinn, and rather than arresting him, tells him Boyle wants him dead, then lets him go. As Quinn leaves, Browning tells him he will be in touch soon, and he expects him to be helpful.\n\nHook is returned to his barracks. Later, despite a formal complaint by Armitage, the commanding officer dismisses the incident involving Hook, Lewis, and Sean as a confused situation that merits no further inquiry. In the final scene, Hook returns to England and reunites with Darren."

Chris stops and gives Nina directions to Bud Moore's ranch while he stays back and stalks Black and his men. Chris hides in a thicket and fires his gun to draw the renegades' attention. Sam Black finds Chris and momentarily stuns him with a pistol whip to the head. Chris awakens, gets up, and knocks out Sam. Chris climbs up on a bluff and lassos Shorty who has stayed behind to tend to Sam's gang's horses. He raises Shorty up like a counterweight as Chris repels down and then chases off the horses, save one on which Chris makes his getaway. Chris, however, is still suffering the effects of the blow to his head. He passes out at the edge of a stream. Nina makes her way to Bud Moore's ranch only to discover it is owned by someone else. The new owner, Vic Byrd (Jack Rockwell) is gruff and commandeers Nina as kitchen help for a friendly man named Matt Downing (George Hayes) who runs that part of the ranch operation. He is familiar with Chris Morrell. Meanwhile, in the town of Snake River, Clara Moore is checking on an order of calico when the Snake River Express office is robbed of $6000 by a man in a checkered shirt and black hat. On his escape, the desperado comes across unconscious Chris Morrell and takes his shirt and hat leaving his own on Chris and rides away. A short time later, Clara rides by in her horse and buggy. She finds Chris unconscious and revives him with a damp cloth. She tells the revived Chris that the only thing for her to do is turn him into the sheriff. Chris tries to convince Clara that the clothes he has on are not his. He tells Clara about his little partner, Nina, who he sent to Bud Moore's place. Clara reveals she is Bud Moore's sister, and that Bud was killed in the range wars several months earlier. When he reveals himself to be Chris Morrell, Clara declares that Bud said he was the best friend a man could have. She suggests changing his shirt at her place. At Clara's home, Chris tells Clara the story of Nina's origins of her Indian mother and no-account white father when her brother Jim (Buffalo Bill Jr.) arrives. Chris recognizes him as the man who changed shirts with him but does not tell Clara because it would break her heart and because \"snakes like him usually die of their own poison\". Nina and Matt are feeding the pigs when Nina's real father Tom (Earl Dwire) rides up. Jim, going with his partner Vic Byrd to retrieve the stolen money, find Sam Black s gang's horses that Chris had stampeded. Meanwhile, Sam Black orders a blister-footed Shorty to find his men some horses. He limps off but it isn't long until he meets Jim and Vic riding with the horses and interested in a conversation with Sam Black. Vic Byrd bargains with Sam to cut him in for $10,000 and Chris Morrell s scalp to turn over the girl at his ranch. Matt Downing rides up to find Chris Morrell and takes him back to the Byrd Ranch. Jim and Vic head to the tree stump where the money is hidden. Once they arrive, Jim retrieves the money only to be shot so Vic could claim both shares. Matt and Chris are startled when they hear the gunshots nearby. They ride up just as Vic gallops off with all the money. Jim tells Matt and Chris that Vic is heading to the ranch to hand over Nina to Sam Black. Chris orders Matt to take Jim to a doctor and heads to the ranch to save Nina. The Black gang find Clara and ask for Chris' whereabouts. Not finding Chris at Clara's home, they force Clara to ride along with the gang. Vic returns to the ranch and finds Tom playing with his daughter. Tom refuses to turn Nina over to Vic who stands to collect $10,000 from Sam Black. When Chris Morrell rides up, Nina announces his arrival and Tom shoots Vic. Sam Black and gang ride up and take refuge in the barn with Clara in tow. The two sides exchange pistol fire. Meanwhile in town, Matt has alerted the sheriff who speeds with a posse to the Byrd Ranch. Matt and Chris shoot one renegade off the barn roof but are down to their last bullet. Sam waves a white rag and offers to 'trade the woman for the kid\" Chris responds, \"Not in a million years.\" Chris offers to trade himself for Clara. Sam agrees. As Chris and Clara pass each other in the exchange, Chris encourages Clara to keep going no matter what happens. Tom shoots their final cartridge and Chris pretends to be dead. Seeing this, Sam orders his men to rush the house. Chris trips up the last man, and they begin to wrestle. The sheriff and his posse arrive and begin another gunfight with Sam's gang. Sam Black ducks inside the house, shoots Tom, and grabs Nina. He takes a chair, breaks out a window in the back and throws Nina out and follows himself. They mount Sam's horse and ride away as the gunfight continues. Chris gets to the house and learns that Sam has grabbed Nina and ridden off. He jumps on his horse in hot pursuit. Meanwhile the posse overwhelms Sam's men. Matt and the sheriff find the stolen money on Vic Byrd s body. Sam Black and Nina ride off a cliff and plunge into the water below. Chris stands on his horse and jumps into the water as well. Sam pulls a knife, a fierce fight ensues, but Chris is able to drown him in the river. Later, Nina and Matt open a door where Clara and Chris are cuddling inside. Happily reunited with Nina, Chris returns to Clara's loving arms."

    "...Watch Out, We're Mad": "\"Watch Out, We're Mad\" begins by narrating that classic story in a display of comic art. In the story, two friends enter a car race to win a dune buggy. But the problem arises when it becomes impossible to share the dune buggy. So the competition began between the friends to eat sausages and beer. But before the result, a goon came and set fire to their red dune buggy. In a fit of rage, the two friends get mad and beat the goon off, forcing their leader to buy dune buggies for each of them. But eventually, one of them caught fire again, leaving another dune buggy on which the two friends continued to fight.\n\nThe scene shifts to another story where those two friends' sons, Carezza (Edoardo Pesce) and Sorriso (Alessandro Roja), playfully run away with the red dune buggy of their fathers, but are blocked by a group of bad guys who offer to gamble. Despite Carezza's disapproval, Sorriso agrees but ultimately loses. As a result, the bad boys escape with the dune buggy as per the terms of the gamble. This time the time-line shifts to the present, where Carezza and Sorriso have grown up. Carezza lives with his dog, Geremia. He is a mechanic.\n\nAt a circus, we are introduced to a female ringmaster named Miriam (Alessandra Mastronardi). But immediately, a group of goons named Cobras, who belong to a notorious businessman named Torsillo (Christian De Sica), arrive at the circus (where Carezza was fixing Miriam's car). But Carezza isn't afraid of them, as even with a strong slap of his hand, Scajone (Massimiliano Rossi), the leader of the Cobras, fails to turn Carezza's head. Torsillo has his eye on Miriam's circus grounds, where he wants to establish his Torsillo Tower, but Miriam is a tough player to give it to him. While at Miriam's Carezza had seen the flier for a local race that had a dune buggy as the first prize. Carezza leaves the circus grounds. Then comes the grown-up Sorriso, who is still angry about the disappearance of the old dune buggy and has seen the same flier for the race as Carezza. Sorriso approaches Carezza at his garage. But Carezza refuses to work with Sorriso. They want to settle the case again by naming them in the competition like their predecessors. Torsillo's son, Raniero (Francesco Bruni), who lacks diplomatic intelligence and common sense like his father, is named in the competition as well. Unfortunately, he doesn't even reach the halfway point of the race due to his own failure. On the contrary, Carezza and Sorriso repeat history by reaching the dune buggy together. So both are declared winners.\n\nThe decision of who will be the owner of the dune buggy is still a doubtful decision to them, so they try to pick the actual winner of the dune buggy through the old-fashioned beer and sausage competition, but the Cobras steal their dune buggy (on behalf of Torsillo and Raniero) while Carezza and Sorriso are busy shoving their mouths with sausages. Miriam arrives at the tavern and wants Carezza to help her defend the circus, but Carezza is not interested. Sorriso tries his best to form a love angle with Miriam, but she is not interested. Carezzo and Sorriso suspect Miriam for stealing their dune buggy. but after a lot of heckling (Including a slapping contest with Miriam's cousin Armandino (Michael Schermi)), Miriam tells him that their dune buggy is with Torsillo, but as a cost of that, she demands that when Sorriso approaches Torsillo, he will have to threaten him to take his eyes off the circus grounds. Carezza and Sorriso muster their courage to reach Torsillo and threaten him to return their dune buggy, but not having planned, they can't tell if they can do any harm to Torsillo. Torsillo promises to return the buggy by the next day, if they leave the meeting with his investors. On his return, Sorriso pulls up the model of Torsillo Tower & takes it away with him, saying that Torsillo has to get his eyes off the land of the circus. Torsillo thinks he can answer it differently.\n\nTorsillo arrives at Carezza's place to prank them with a small toy model of the dune buggy. Carezza and Sorriso knew they wouldn't get their car back so easily, so after Torsillo's departure, they beat the Cobra gang, breaking all the bones in their bodies. Raniero wants to return the buggy to the guys, but Torsillo tells Raniero to be mean and never blink in a fight. Raniero is not convinced but decides to be mean, to impress his father. While Carezza and Sorriso are watching Miriam's circus performance, Torsillo's son Raniero arrives with the dune buggy. When Carezza comes running in joy to see his car, Raniero sets fire to the yellow roof of the dune buggy, causing the entire circus to burn. Carezza rescues his dog Geremia, and Sorriso runs to save Miriam. But Miriam learns from her brother that their circus tiger has escaped. Together, Miriam Sorriso and Carezza plan to make Torsillo's end.\n\nThe next day, when Torsillo throws a party with his business clients, Carezza walks in as a musician and catches Scajone's eye. while Torsillo's enlarged and more powerful Cobra gang attacks them, Carezza and Sorriso, along with the circus men, beat the gangsters of the Cobra gang and make their situation worse. When Miriam finally blocks Torsillo's way after a violent riot, he points a gun at Miriam. But she survives when her escaped circus tiger pounces on Torsillo. Carezza and Sorriso get their dune buggies back. But the fight for rights over it continues, so Sorriso and Cariza go back to the restaurant for a beer and sausage competition. But while they are both busy eating, Miriam escapes with the dune buggy again.\n\nWe also saw before Miriam came to disrupt Carezza and Sorriso's sausage competition, right before their dune buggy was stolen in the first place. However, it is quite possible that Miriam stole the dune buggy and left it near Torsillo so that Sorriso and Carezza take their revenge and Miriam gets her land back. It could be a possibility that Miriam is sketching a new plan, but what is that? However, \"Watch Out, We're Mad\" ends here with her plan remaining a secret."

    "009-1: The End of the Beginning": "It's easy for spies to access J Country, now that The West Bloc and the East Bloc countries are at each other's throats. A girl gets access to Stinger, an underworld boss, and gets into his bed as easily. Spider exposes her as an infiltrated agent, and he is well protected, but the girl defeats them all in hand-to-hand fight and using their guns against them. But Spider points a gun to her head. She drops her gun, then drops the white sheet that she had managed to keep wrapping her body, exposing her breasts to him. Spider downs his eyes from her face to her breasts, as she - with a slight movement of her chest muscles, puts several slugs into his stomach. Slider falls down in a pool of gore, just as he recognizes the girl who killed him is the West Bloc agent 009-1.\n\nSlinger's girlfriend, Butterfly, is at the \"morgue\", choosing people to be killed to extract their vital organs for transplants. 009-1 gains access to the place that is protected by fingerprint detection, using Slinger's forefinger, and then she throws Slinger's severed arm at Butterfly's feet, with contempt. 009-1 disposes of a handful of bodyguards in a quick gunfight, then battles Butterfly hand-to-hand, countering the girls' attacks with blade weapons. Before running away, Butterfly calls 009-1, \"Monster!\"\n\n009-1 remembers in flash-back how she had lost her parents, was chosen by the 00 Department to serve the Western Bloc, and was trained as a spy. The Department head, 020, instructs her to rescue Dr. Clyne, the scientist responsible for Project Faust - the mass production of human beings. Dr. Clyne has been captured in her lab by three East Bloc agents, now waiting for ex-filtration from J Country. 009-1 arrives on the premises, already surrounded by an SMA team, and the Officer taunts her, ending by saying that it's true \"what they say about you, that you're not just human, you're a monster\".\n\nUsing her cyborg powers, 009-1 bypasses the net of infra-red rays that protects the compound. Yet, she is attacked by the three East Bloc agents in a ferocious battle hand-to-hand and with knives, but she beats them. Agent Shadow receives a message from headquarters, \"There is no rescue.\" Shadow can't believe her ears, \"Motherland has abandoned us,\" she says, and the three agents fall in despair. 009-1 simply turns her back on them, and leaves.\n\n009-1 unties the ropes binding Dr. Clyne, and tries to bring up the subject that Dr. Clyne is her cyber mother, but the other woman turns her back on her and leaves the room. When they pass through the entrance room, the three agents are about to commit suicide, but 009-1 stops them, arguing that \"Our lives never belong to ourselves.\" East Agent #2 says, \"We get abandoned once we're useless. This is the destiny of spies. You're the same!\" Dr. Clyne picks a gun from the floor and in quick succession, shoots the enemies through their heads, and says \"It's a waste of time.\" Turning to 009-1, she adds, \"Don't show me a face like that, you're just a tool.\" Dr. Clyne gives orders to the SMA team, and in a brief exchange with 009-1, this one understands that the traffic of organs is something Dr. Clyne is comfortable with.\n\n009-1 stays a moment alone with a young man guinea-pig whom she had saved the day before from the \"morgue\". He doesn't remember anything about him, and she names him Chris, \"because your eyes make me think of crystals\", then asks him to sing the lullaby song he had been singing before. Closing her eyes, 009-1 seems to remember (flash-back) her father singing that lullaby to her and her brother when both were children. Sounds of shooting bring 009-1 to the present.\n\nOutside, Miriam - a cyborg in black leather - is disposing of the elements of the SMA team, as they find that their automatic weapons are useless against her immediate body reconstruction powers. 009-1 gets out and sees Miriam just as she finished killing the team leader. They fight using karate and some pro-wrestling moves. In a sort of bear hug, 009-1 unzips her red leather top to expose her breasts, and shoot Miriam in the face. But while 009-1 picks her discarded gun from the floor, Miriam has reconstructed herself, and attacks her again. The appearance of Chris creates a distraction, but then Miriam ends up by shooting Chris - as 009-1 (flash-back) remembers a similar scene when her kid brother was abducted from home. 009-1 is able to perform a medical check on him, and concludes that his life is not at risk.\n\nShe runs to the rooftop in time to see Dr. Clyne's being taken away in a helicopter that shoots a missile at her. 009-1 runs away in a motorbike, and the helicopter gives chase shooting missiles at her. Some hit at a street full of humble people, who run away. A little girl, Koto, falls, and 009-1 instinctively protects her with her body as (flash-back) her mother had done to protect her, being shot dead by soldiers. Koto's mother watches 009-1's wounds being restored on the spot, and mumbles, \"Monster!\" That downs on her, \"I am... a monster.\"\n\nLater, Chris is in 009-1's room, in bed - apparently strong already, and they seem to be romantically attracted, with no common memories but that lullaby song. She tells him that her real name is Mirine. [Mylene in a different transliteration] They make love - without stripping.\n\n020 is displeased that 009-1 has not gone straight to headquarters after her mission, and that she failed to rescue Dr. Clyne to attend to Chris. 020's Secretary tells her that the other agents will take care of the matter, and asks 009-1 to hand out her gun. As she does, the Secretary says with a mocking smile, \"Bye, monster.\"\n\n009-1 KO's two armed guards, knocks down the Assistant with a punch to the face, and (flash-back) using the same words of Agent #2, tells 020 that she is not a tool to be abandoned... She runs away on her motorbike, but at her room she finds Chris with his face in blood, and a bomb explodes. 020 receives a report of this, and seems happy.\n\nIn a rich mansion with a swimming-pool, a magnate - and five young women in bikinis - is playing chess with a set of pieces based on Ancient Egypt. 009-1, disguised as a blonde with a wig and in a bikini, attacks a maid named Sherry, forcing a lesbian scene with her - that some of the girls watching, is interesting. But while fondling and kissing Sherry against a window in a corner, 009-1 is progressing in her work. \"Is the map of area D really here?\" \"Don't worry - The party host, Alan Lau, has it.\" \"How do I get it?\" \"By playing chess with Lau,\" the undercover agent Sherry answers. \"And betting your body for it.\"\n\nSome time later, with all the bodyguards and waitresses watching around them, 009-1 is playing chess against Lau, and he acknowledges that she's a good player. Just as she makes a decisive move to checkmate, and demands her pay. He asks a small computer from a servant, and introduces a sort of cylindrical pen in it. It produces a moving image of its content (on a digital screen in the air) that the West Bloc agent recognizes. But Mr. Lau tells her that that military facility is now obsolete, so he wants to know, \"Why are you so interested in this?\" \"To say the truth, I'm interested in ruins. The game is over, give it to me.\" Instead, he gives back the computer to the servant, and approaches her, to smell her golden hair. \"It smells so good. Smells like money.\" Suddenly, he lets himself fall on a couch, pointing a gun at her - as all the bodyguards also pull their guns on her. He demands that she tells him the truth.\n\nSuddenly the door opens, and Butterfly makes her entrance on the scene, in her usual black lace dress. Using automatic weapons, she kills a number of bodyguards, others with her fan provided with iron fangs. Five bikini girls hide on another couch, and two maids behind a cupboard. Lau still has his gun, but he has not shot yet. He wants to know who the intruder is. \"None of your business,\" Butterfly says. \"I want the blondie [sic] over there.\" Then, addressing 009-1, \"You can never fool my eyes... monster!\" With a look of resignation, the \"blonde\" takes her wig and throws it at the muzzle of Butterfly's hand machine-gun, deviating her line of fire. In a somersault, 009-1 picks a discarded gun from the floor, to shoot back at Butterfly, but she has attacked Lau, and uses his body as a shield. 009-1 shoots at his lower chest and belly, and he falls dying on the couch, yet commenting on her shooting, \"Perfect...\"\n\nBoth rival women throw away their empty guns, and come to grips, whirling around the room and falling on the pool outside. Wrestling in the water is fierce, both women attempting to choke or dunk the other (with underwater camera). They come out of the pool, and Butterfly has the upper-hand, and a gun she picks from the floor from one of the guards. She is shot dead by Sherry, who makes a surprise appearance from inside the house. After they leave, 020's Secretary appears on the scene (apparently she was in the house already) and looks at the body of Butterfly afloat in the water.\n\nSherry takes 009-1 to her place, despite she tells her that Department D is tracking her down. The relationship between Sherry and her teenage brother Kai, seems to awake some emotion in 009-1. After dinner, the two young women talk about Dr. Clyne, and 009-1 says she is still looking for her, because the scientist may know something about Mirine's past. Sherry dreams of leaving Intelligence, and live a normal life with her brother.\n\nTogether, they visit the ruins where Department D is located. Mirine's runs after the sound (or fantasy) of the lullaby song, but when she thinks she has reached her mother on a rocking chair (amidst flash-backs of her youth) she is neutralized with a special weapon by someone. Mirine awakes tied to a gurney, deprived of her red leather outfit but with a metal bra on and still wearing red knee boots. The gurney is large enough to accommodate Miriam, wearing a fetishist black leather outfit, astride Mirine and fondling and kissing her.\n\nA man tells Mirine that \"Miriam was made from the prototype of your mama,\" and indeed (amidst of flash-backs of her youth) Mirine associates the face of her mother with that of the woman who's now kissing her. The man comes forward, and Mirine recognizes Chris, who only had pretended to be dead. He explains his plan to help her get her memories back. As he talks, Miriam has taken Mirine off the gurney, though keeping her in control in a choke hold, and now the girl recognizes Paul in the man she had named Chris when they first met. Now, he proposes that they should unite against those who had wiped off her memories. He had been raised in the East Bloc as an agent, and now he has a plan to make an atomic attack against a West Bloc and an East Bloc targets, so that both blocs annihilate each other in all out war - assuming the first attacker was the other bloc... \"A new world will arise from the ashes of the old.\" \"It's wrong!\" Mirine counters. She wants to know where Dr. Clyne is. He refuses to tell, and Miriam attacks Mirine. In a moment of respite in the fighting, Mirine adds, \"A full-scale war will send many people to hell. Many will lose their love, like us.\" Paul is determined, though. The two women fight again, but Miriam subdues Mirine, as Paul tells further of his plan to unite his and Mirine's body to create a new generation of people. He tells her that the 00 project had failed, because all the orphans that had been operated on had all died, only 009-1 had survived. She tells him that there are eight other agents like her, and he counters that she's wrong - she has been lied to by 020. \"Mirine, you are the only monster in this world.\" Even the experiments with robots and genetic engineering had failed... From the darkness of the room, Dr. Clyne steps forward to confirm Paul's words. It was she who had put Mirine to sleep, and now she considers that mutants like 009-1 are obsolete, and she has developed new tools: living-dead mutants. A dozen zombie-like creatures stagger onto the room, and Sherry is among them. Mirine attacks Dr. Clyne, who loses her ray gun, but she orders the living-dead mutants to attack. Suddenly, the group gets quite alive, and Mirine has to fight against the group, damaging many. Dr. Clyne is not worried, because \"Despite how badly damaged they are, the living-dead will always stand up again.\" Dr. Clyne even laughs about it - the perfection of her work. Mirine listens to Sherry's thoughts [by telepathy], though: \"I wanna get back to Kai.\" Paul mumbles, \"It's ugly,\" presses a button on a remote control, and the living-dead turn their attack from Mirine to Dr. Clyne. Her laughter changes into worry, she fires a pistol onto the group, without avail. Sherry has a choke hold on Mirine, as the other living-dead gore and kill the lady scientist.\n\nMirine still refuses to be part of Paul's incestuous plan, and Paul signals Sherry to kill Mirine. The two women fight. Sherry gets hold of Dr. Clyne's pistol, and shoots Mirine down, after Sherry cries tears of blood (literally). Mirine bends to close Sherry's eyes. \"I've finally got it. The reason why I became a monster [looking up to Paul and Miriam] is to finish this crazy world. So I've nothing to lose.\" Paul uses his remote control again, and a new group of living-dead surges from outside to attack Mirine. She mows them down with the gun, and her bare hands, and they all die in gore fashion. \"It seems that your heart is out of control,\" Paul comments. \"So, [looking at Miriam] at least, I want your body.\" Then, addressing Miriam, he says, \"Mama, follow me.\"\n\nMiriam attacks Mirine, and the two women fight using martial arts. Mirine gets the gun back and shoots at Miriam. Outside, Paul is looking at his watch, finding that Miriam is taking too long to meet him at the helicopter pad. Mirine tumbles out of the house in ruins, and crawls to Paul's feet. After her, comes Miriam, poised and controlled as usual, keeping her kicking and punching attack on Mirine, who fights back. Paul is enjoying the fight, and again calling Miriam \"mama\". Suddenly, a powerful kick sends Miriam against the helicopter's structure, igniting an explosion that blows it - and Miriam - away. \"My sister, why are you against me?\" Paul asks. \"Why?!\" From the helicopter wrecks, Miriam surges, reconstructed, and producing a samurai sword from nowhere. The women fight again, and the quickness of Mirine counters the deadly strikes of the perfect blade. Then, Mirine disengages from the fight, runs at her brother - who had come closer to better watch the fight - and grabs him by the neck, offering her back to Miriam. Miriam runs at her to impale her through, and Mirine sidesteps just in time for the sword to impale Paul through the stomach to his back. \"Mirine... I love you,\" says Paul dying against Miriam's body. Miriam steps back, so that Paul's body falls on the floor, and then with a precise strike, she cuts the joint of Mirine's metal bra, which cups fall to the floor, exposing the girl's breasts. Again, Mirine's arches her back a little, firing a number of bullets straight at Miriam's head, disintegrating it. Miriam's mechanical voice repeats a message implanted in her modified brain long ago, \"Do not fear, nothing to fear\".\n\n\"Paul, as you said, those who started conflicts should be hated. I'll fight against them,\" says Mirine, getting out of the ruins where Department D was housed. [end credits and inserts of movie scenes]\n\nMirine walks to Department D's main building, holding a metallic cylinder with her,and meets 020's Secretary by the door. \"You've really done it, you deserve to be called a monster,\" the Secretary says. Without replying, Mirine walks into the building and places the gas cylinder on top of 020's desk. \"I've fetched Dr. Clyne.\" \"This?\" asks 020. \"A life-saving device keeps her brain cells alive,\" she explains. \"All the data of Project Faust is in this. My mission is to fetch the \"head\" of the West Bloc, isn't it?\" \"I'll report to the commission of investigation, but there are still rules. At least, be prepared for a punishment [returning her her badge and weapon]... 009-1.\" \"Bye.\" She picks the objects, and turns her back on him. \"And...\" he says, \"It's about Sherry's brother that you took back here. He's been accepted by the facility, and taken good care of. \"To be trained as a future spy?\" \"Something's wrong with it?\" \"No. It has nothing to do with me.\"\n\nAlone, 020 calls his superior that 009-1 has turned to be a good agent again, and some day she'll save the world. \"As you planned, Number 0.\""

    "10,000 BC": "In 10,000 BC, a tribe of hunter-gatherers called the Yagahl live in a remote mountain range in the Urals and survive by killing woolly mammoths. D'Leh, a young hunter, has a companion named Evolet, an orphan who was found by the tribe. D'Leh, while hunting mammoths, manages to kill one and wins the \"White Spear\". He also wins Evolet in marriage, but feels he deserves neither since he killed the mammoth by accident.\n\nOne day, D'Leh and several others are away when horse-raiders called the \"Four Legged Demons\" attack the Yaghal camp. The horse raiders enslave Evolet; D'Leh, Tic'Tic, KaRen, and Baku pursue them to save her. They enter a rain-forest where they catch up with the raiding party. During the night D'Leh rescues Evolet, but as they are trying to escape from the pursuing raiders, they are attacked by a large pack of terror birds. Tic'Tic gets wounded and Baku and Ka'Ren and Evolet are re-captured. Continuing, they meet others whose loved ones were taken by the raiders. D'Leh and Tic'Tic befriend Nakudu, leader of the Naku tribe. He tells D'Leh of a prophecy: whoever talks to a Smilodon that they call the \"Spear-Tooth\" will help free their people. D'Leh had earlier saved the Spear-Tooth from drowning in a trap, and it had spared his life. D'Leh realizes the prophecy was about him. Nakudu explains that his loved ones were taken in the \"Great Red Birds\", ships with large red sails, to the \"Mountains of the Gods\", from which no one has ever returned. They then come together with other tribes, who agree to form a coalition to pursue the raiders.\n\nThey find the ships with red sails holding Evolet and Baku. They have no means to follow the ships, so they journey through a vast desert, discovering an advanced civilization like ancient Egypt, ruled by an enigmatic figure known as \"The Almighty\", who is said to be the last survivor of his kind. The Almighty, who is regarded as a living god, possesses many thousands of slaves that he is using to build a huge pyramid complex in his honor. D'Leh finds an escaped servant of the Almighty and notices he is wearing a bracelet worn by D'Leh's father. D'Leh's father left his tribe for food and found the Naku tribe before being stolen by the raiders. In a night attack, the guards of the slaves discover D'Leh behind a pyramid. Tic'Tic dies from injuries from killing the guards before they raise the alarm. Meanwhile, the Almighty's priests discover Evolet bears scars on her hand patterned after the \"Mark of the Hunter\", the constellation Orion. The priests believe it is part of a prophecy that whoever wears the mark of the Hunter is destined to kill The Almighty. D'Leh starts a full-scale rebellion among the slaves. They cause the mammoth herd, used in building the pyramid, to stampede and kill many troops.\n\nThe Almighty offers Evolet to D'Leh in exchange for abandoning his rebellion. The Almighty says that if D'Leh takes his wife, his warriors can return, but the rest must be his slaves forever. D'Leh feigns acceptance of the deal which allows him to throw a spear at The Almighty and kill him, proving that he is not a god. During the ensuing battle, the raider obsessed with Evolet kidnaps her on horseback. Evolet grabs an arrow and stabs the warlord in the side, knocking them both off the horse. D'Leh rushes towards her, but the raider shoots her in the back. D'Leh kills him and returns to Evolet, and she dies in his arms. The scene shifts to the tribe's wise woman as she breathes in deeply and then breathes out her last breath. The scene then returns to D'Leh still holding Evolet's body when she suddenly awakens, restored by the wise woman's sacrifice. They depart for home and bid farewell to the other tribes. They bring back grains which allow them to plant for food & give up their hunter gatherer days"

    "12 Mighty Orphans": "Football Coach Rusty Russell (Luke Wilson) believed that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. He believed in himself and in 12 Mighty Orphans, who, against all odds, went on to play the Football State Championship in 1938. The film fables the exemplary tale of misfits and forgotten children who became the mighty orphans, the classic underdogs. The film shows the Texas High School State Championship, 1938, where the Orphans play against the Sandies. After a devastating half-time, the narrative rolls back to 6 months earlier.\n\nWar Hero Rusty Russell (Luke Wilson) arrives in Fort Worth, Texas, with his wife Juanita (Vinessa Shaw) and young daughter to join The Masonic Home. Rusty takes the job of new math, science teacher, and football coach in the Orphan School. While Juanita is hired to teach English. Warden Frank Wynn (Wayne Knight) welcomes the new teachers and gets them accustomed to the school. Rusty soon learns of the ongoing horror in the school. Warden Frank physically assaults kids to compel them into child labor to fill his own pockets. The orphan boys lack education and are unaware of their own freedom of expression. With the help of the school's physician, E.P. Hall \"Doc Hall,\" (Martin Sheen) Rusty fosters a football team. Rusty believes that the game will bring self-respect and passion to these boys roaming like aimless chickens indulging themselves in an abyss of manual labor.\n\nWhat lays ahead is a series of hurdles in the Orphans' pursuit towards the state championship. Warden Frank Wynn did everything in his power to stop the orphans from playing football. He feared that the game would bring passion in the aimless boys who would prefer to spend time on the field instead of his printing workshop. Warden Frank was a hard nut to crack, but the boys themselves were the first hurdle in Rusty's journey. They were hard-boiled and untrained and only a bunch of hooligans to begin with. Fortunately, Rusty and Doc Hall knew how to melt down the boys' egos and train them appropriately. Looking at their zeal, Rusty applied for their admission in \"the Interscholastic League.\" However, the new rules stated that all players were required to take a basic aptitude test. Rusty took that as a challenge and taught the unschooled boys. To his surprise, only 12 Orphans passed the aptitude test, and thus Rusty was obliged to make a team of only 12 players. To fill the gap in the group, all the players had to play both ways, which was pretty endearing and courageous. Players include Snoggs (Jacob Lofland), Chicken (Sampley Barinaga), Wheatie (Slade Monroe). The boys trained passionately without shoes, football, and proper equipment, and Rusty left no stone upturned to transform them into mighty warriors. He gets the girls wing to stitch uniforms and helmets for his players. Now, it was time to test their mettle in their first football match.\n\nThe Mighty Orphans played their first match against their rival Polytechnic or \"The Poly Parrots\" in 1938. Though they lost the game to the Ploys, the Orphans were just warming up. They took the Texas Football Circuit by a blitz and became the Classic Underdogs in the middle of the Depression. Rusty's orphan team players were slim, short, and none crossed the required weight of 200 pounds. Rusty coined a spread offense technique (with a new position called the quarterback) to make up for their limitations that later gave him \"hall of fame\" recognition in Texas Sports Hall. The Mighty Orphans were on a winning spree and soon came across their nemesis \"Polytechnic\" again in the Regional Semi-Final. The orphans won the game and entered the state championship, but casualties were fatal to their future efforts. One of their key players, Fairbanks (Levi Dylan), procured severe injuries due to which he never played football again.\n\nThe orphan team had to play the state championship with only 11 players. Before the semi-final match, Warden Frank Wynn shared some confidential documents with Polytechnic team captain Luther Scarborough (Lane Garrison). But Luther didn't use this secret weapon until Mighty Orphans won the game against his team. While the orphans were celebrating, UIL accused Orphans team of age violations, mainly lying about their star player Hardy Brown's (Jake Austin Walker) age. They were suspended from the championship, and the Polytechnic team was given their place.\n\nAccording to Hardy's birth certificate submitted to the president of UIL, Rodney Kidd (Scott Haze) (coincidentally, Luther's brother-in-law), Harden Henry Brown was born on September 4th, 1920. As per his age, in 1938, he was deemed ineligible to compete at the high school level. But at the UIL assembly, Hardy told them that the birth certificate belonged to his older brother, who died a week after he was born. Mistakenly, Warden Frank gave the wrong birth certificate to Luther in his pursuit to destroy the Orphan Team. However, even after the revelations, Rodney refused to alter his decision until he got a call from President Roosevelt, who took an active interest in Mighty Orphan's journey. Finally, 12 Mighty Orphans got a chance to play in the state championship, and they traveled to Amarillo to unleash their hard work. In the meantime, Warden Frank was arrested by the sheriff for violating child labor laws, and his illegal printing press was closed by the principal.\n\nIn Amarillo, the narrative jumped on to follow the match after half-past time. Sandies were leading with 7 points, while orphans didn't score any. It was a tough fight against the Sandies, who were incredibly huge and robust for the Orphans. The orphans bled and got injured, yet they didn't give up. They used their \"Snoggs Special\" passing technique against the furious bulls of Sandies. But even with such endeavor, Hardy, who had the last chance to score, failed to touch the goal. Six Golden Sandies piled up on Hardy Brown to stop, and alas, they succeeded. The Mighty Orphans lost the match, though what they won that day couldn't be described in words. It was a belief in themselves that would go on to last their entire lives.\n\nA rolling credit sequence gives away the life of prominent characters of the film after their state championship match. Rusty's legacy as the greatest coach in Texas still lives on. The famed Hardy Brown is still known as one of the toughest men in the game. A single man's vision touched so many lives with a single pursuit, and one couldn't be thankful enough for an inspiring tale of their efforts."

    "12 Rounds": "New Orleans. May 16, nighttime. A team of FBI agents, led by Special Agent George Aiken (Steve Harris) and Ray Santiago (Gonzalo Menendez), monitor a street for an international terrorist, named Miles Jackson (Aidan Gillen). Using facial recognition software, they scan different people in the street. Finally, they catch sight of him. Aiken, playing with a small yellow toy car, rattles off Miles' crimes - murder, bombings, even the decapitation of his own brother for messing up a mission. Aiken and Santiago speak to one of Miles' confederates, Samuel, who is reluctantly cooperating with them in exchange for his brother, Joshua's, release.\n\nMeanwhile, Officer Danny Fisher (John Cena) and his girlfriend, Molly Porter (Ashley Scott), are at their recently-purchased home. Danny's on his way out and looks around for his badge, while surreptitiously sneaking his dog some noodles. After showing him where his badge is, Molly tells him to be safe. He goes out and sees his partner, Officer Hank Carver (Brian White), waiting for him in their squad car. They drive off. Danny and Hank, being best friends, talk about Danny moving in with Molly. Hank expects Danny to pop the question soon, but Danny laughs it off. They get a message from Dispatch to help the FBI out in their operation. Hank whines about them having to jump through hoops for the Feds, while the latter seldom help them out, case in point - Katrina relief.\n\nThe Feds see Miles calls Sam on his cell phone, but can't tap the line as Miles always uses encrypted phones. Sam reports that Miles is on his way; he's bringing the weapons and they'll be making an exchange. Aiken waits eagerly. Miles arrives at the meeting place in a cab and approaches Sam. He starts to talk business with Sam, but Sam says he can't do this and exposes the FBI's plan to arrest Miles. He then shoots Miles in the stomach and has his men drag Miles to the waiting van. He shoots out the FBI's cameras, after telling them to release his brother in exchange for Miles. Sam gets in the back with Miles and they drive off. Turns out Sam and Miles are working together and Miles was wearing Kevlar. Aiken finds out that the safehouse holding Sam's brother was attacked and two agents are dead and Joshua's escaped. Sam pays Miles for springing his brother. However, Miles stabs Sam to death, as he would have left him out to dry if his brother was still inside. They reach the next rendezvous, where Miles' girlfriend, Erica Kessen (Taylor Cole), waits. She's already killed the van driver and passenger. He shows her the briefcase Sam gave him - it's full of diamonds. They get in a car and drive away.\n\nDanny and Hank, on their way to help the FBI, look at Miles' record. They see surveillance images and video - including one of him dancing with Erica. At a traffic light, Danny spots Erica in her car. He tells Hank to follow her car. They pull her over and Hank goes over to check her licence and registration. She flirts a bit with Hank, who flirts right back. Danny stands behind the car and tells her to pop the trunk. Just then, Miles springs out of the trunk and starts shooting at the officers, hitting Hank in the butt. Erica drives off. Danny checks up on Hank and then takes off on foot, in pursuit of the car. He runs through a lot of narrow alleys, through a house, on the road. He loses his gun, after an encounter with a dog. He sees Erica's car coming on the road towards him. He pushes a parked boat into their path and causes them to crash. Picking up Miles' gun, he holds it at him. Erica tries to run, but finds herself in the way of an oncoming SUV. She gets hit hard and dies. Miles is shocked and enraged. He tells Danny he'll remember him. As backup arrives, Danny holds him at bay, while saddened at the girl's death.\n\nOne year later, Danny and Hank, since promoted to detectives, blow off some steam at a pool parlor. Hank flirts with some girls and tells Danny that, in two days, it will be one whole year since they were promoted. Danny still feels bad about Erica's death. He leaves for home. At home, he wakes up in time for Molly to leave for her job as a nurse on the night-shift at University Hospital. He finds the bathroom floor covered with water, thanks to a broken pipe. Molly sits under it, just about giving up . She tells him that she called Phil, the plumber. Phil arrives and, seeing the mess, tells Danny that he should have got the pipe replaced two months earlier as he said he'd take care of. Danny confessed to Molly that he was trying to save money. She seems a bit upset, but he tells her to trust him. She says she does and leaves for work.\n\nJust then, Danny gets a call on his cell phone. It's from Miles Jackson! He tells Danny that he's escaped from prison and is now back for some payback. He says that he's close. Danny grabs his badge and gun and runs outside the house, looking for Miles. Miles tells him that he killed his girlfriend, but Danny retorts that it was an accident. Suddenly, Danny's car and house (with poor Phil inside) explode, throwing Danny to the ground. After he recovers, he hears Miles tell him that it's their \"anniversary\" - the day that Danny got the better of him. Now he wants a rematch. The house, the car and Phil were Round 1. He tells him that he took the one thing that can never be replaced and, in return, will do the same. He challenges Danny to try and stop him. Danny hands his dog over to some neighbors and starts running towards the ferry station, where Molly is.\n\nMolly gets on the ferry. Miles' henchman, Anthony Deluso (Travis Davis), approaches her and asks if he can use her cell phone to call his daughter. She obliges. He keeps the phone busy, preventing Danny from getting through. Miles watches from the other side, as he gets rid of his SIM card and puts a new one into his phone. Danny reaches the station a little too late. He tries to yell out to her, but is drowned out by the ferry. Seeing the ferry name, Thomas Jefferson (I think...), he commandeers a car and speeds off towards the other side. On his way over the bridge, he calls Hank and tells him that Miles Jackson escaped from prison and is trying to take Molly. He needs him to call the Department of Transportation and have the ferry stopped at the station, or he might lose Molly.\n\nReaching the station on the other side, he sprints inside and has the security personnel shut down the station. Hank and backup arrive, but it's too late - there's no sign of Molly. He tries her cell phone. Miles answers. He has Molly tied up in the back of his car. This was Round 2. The game is 12 Rounds. If, at the end of the 12 Rounds, Danny does all that Miles says and lives, he'll let Molly go.\n\nRound 3 - Miles will be calling a cell phone in 15 minutes. Danny has to get to the spot where he and Miles first met and, from there, find the phone. Miles hangs up and disposes of the cell phone. Danny and Hank drive to the spot where they pulled Erica over the year before. They see some graffiti on a wall, with the day's date (05-16-08) on it, along with a latitude and longitude. They find that the place is the firehouse where Danny's brother, Dave, works. Danny calls Dave and tells him to evacuate the firehouse, as there might be a bomb inside. Dave complies and, soon, all the firemen and trucks are cleared out from the firehouse. Danny and Hank arrive on the scene. Danny announces to all the firefighters to pull out their cell phones as Miles might call one of them. When time runs out, Danny hears a cell phone ringing. It's coming from inside a cell phone store. He runs inside and answers it. Miles congratulates him and tells him he's won extra time on the next round. The fire alarm segues into Round 4...\n\nRound 4 - Miles says that a fire has broken out in the New Orleans Savings and Loan. Danny has to get there and extract two security deposit boxes located on the top floor, the numbers of which are in the memory of the cell phone he's holding. He has 20 minutes. Danny almost has a breakdown, but Hank keeps him from losing it. Hank has a lead on the guy who helped Miles kidnap Molly. He'll go look into that, while Danny continues with the \"game\". Just then, the FBI shows up. Special Agents Aiken and Santiago approach Danny and ask him about Miles Jackson. Danny is livid that Miles broke out of prison and the Feds didn't tell him. Aiken coolly tells him to get over it and work with them, if he wants Molly back. Reluctantly, Danny hitches a ride with Aiken and Santiago, while Dave and the other firefighters head off in their firetrucks.\n\nAs they drive, the Feds tell Danny that Miles used a prison riot as cover to escape. Aiken tells him that it's unusual for Miles to show himself out in the open like this. This is a golden opportunity to get him. However, Danny only cares about Molly's safety. At the scene of the fire, Danny gets out and runs in with Dave and the others. Santiago tells Aiken that this is exactly what Miles wants and that they should stop Danny before people get hurt, however Aiken wants to use Danny as a distraction, so they can blindside Miles. Danny and Dave run through the smoke-covered corridors, looking for the security boxes. They find them, however they both have timers counting down, with less than 7 minutes remaining. Miles calls and says that Round 5 has started.\n\nRound 5 - One of the boxes is a bomb, while the other contains a clue to the next round. He has to get to the Nicholls Street Wharf in less than 7 minutes. If he doesn't get there in time, the bomb goes off. Since time is a constraint, Miles advises him to use a firetruck. With 6 minutes left and a long way downstairs, Danny decides to go out the window. Seeing a huge spool of cable, he tells Dave to anchor down one end, while he throws the rest of it out the window. Carrying the two boxes in a bag, he goes down the cable. Finding himself out of cable and some feet to go, he lets go and crashes through some scaffolding, much to the horror of the onlookers. Recovering quickly, he hijacks a firetruck and races through the streets of New Orleans, causing quite a lot of damage along the way. With less than a 20 seconds to go, he reaches the edge of the wharf. Miles calls him and tells him he's too late. Danny waits with bated breath for the bomb to go off. However, a bell goes off from inside one of the boxes. Knowing it's the bomb, Danny grabs it and throws it into the water, where it explodes harmlessly. That signals the start of the next round.\n\nRound 6 - From atop the Hotel Monteleone, Miles watches Danny standing near the firetruck as the cops and Feds approach. Danny demands to talk to Molly, but Miles promises him that he will show her to him. He tells him that the other box contains the clue. The box is handed over to the bomb squad, who saw it open and declare it clear. The Feds give Danny a new cell phone, through which they can track him and the calls. The clue in the box is a room-keycard for the Hotel Monteleone. Cops, Feds and SWAT rush into the hotel. They raid the room and find it empty. To his anguish, Danny finds a couple of Polaroids of a gagged and bound Molly. The Feds look at the security camera footage and see Miles holding a sheet of paper up, which reads \"WE ARE STILL HERE\". They see him talking with a heavyset man, named Willie Dumaine (Peter Navy Tuiasosopo). Danny goes to speak to Willie about Miles. Willie shows him where they went - they took an old elevator to the roof. Danny and Willie get on the elevator. As they ascend, a small charge fixed to the elevator motor goes off, stopping the elevator. Danny sees his cell phone has no signal there. He tries to get the elevator service phone, but finds a small laptop there instead. He opens it and sees a video of Molly tearfully reading off a sheet of paper as Miles stands nearby. She says that, at the conclusion of the message, they have 60 seconds to get off the elevator before it freefalls to the bottom. She says the next clue is inside the lobby. The video ends and a timer starts counting down from 60 seconds. Danny climbs through a service hatch and starts to pull Willie through. It's a gigantic effort considering Willie's girth. He manages to get Willie up onto the top of the elevator. With almost no time left, Danny tells Willie to take his hand as he climbs along the shaft wall. However, Willie's back is blown and he can't get up. The bomb on top explodes, sending the elevator and the unfortunate Willie down to the ground in freefall, as Danny watches in despair. The elevator crash is pops loose a gas line. The hotel and surrounding blocks are evacuated. Danny walks out, despondently. His phone rings. Aiken tells him to wait as they prepare to trace the call. Aiken tells him to keep Miles on for 30 seconds. Miles, from inside a streetcar, speaks to Danny. Danny is enraged and frustrated, but tries to stall. However, Miles figures it out and hangs up before 30 seconds, thereby cutting off the tracker.\n\nRound 7 - Miles calls again and tells him that the clue to the next round is in the hotel lobby. It's a picture of a lonely man. He'll call him in 2 minutes. Danny goes to the lobby and searches. He finds the picture and finds \"CLAIBORNE & TOULOUSE\" written on a Post-It on the back. The phone rings. Santiago tells him not to answer it, but Aiken demands he do it. Danny answers the phone. Miles tells him to be there alone in 10 minutes and he \"may have a 50-50 chance in having the time of [his] life\". As Danny leaves, Aiken admonishes Santiago.\n\nAt Claiborne and Toulouse, Danny waits anxiously. He sees a bus pull up - Bus number 5050. Realizing that's what Miles meant, he gets on. To his bemusement, he finds Molly on board, shaken and scared. He sees she's wearing a bomb underneath her jacket. Sitting nearby is Miles, who tells them to sit. He goes over to Danny and pulls out the wire he's wearing. However, the Feds hear his voice and realize he's on the bus. Aiken orders a strike team to prepare an assault. In the bus, Miles handcuffs Danny to a bar. He shows Danny his PDA, on which he's pressing his thumb. If his thumb goes off the screen, 10 seconds later, a small charge sends a nail into Molly's heart, killing her, and 30 seconds later, the bomb explodes. He gives Danny an envelope, with a phone number on it, as the clue to the next round. Aiken orders a couple of snipers to take position on the overpass, under which the bus will go soon. One will shoot a hole in the window, while the other one will kill Miles. Aiken doesn't care who gets killed, as long as Miles is one of them. As they approach the overpass, Danny notices the snipers and pulls Miles and Molly down to the floor of the bus, just as they open fire. He gets grazed in the shoulder, as the snipers unload on the bus. The bus grinds to a halt and everyone runs outside. Miles ushers Molly out of the bus and blends with the others. Danny, handcuffed and wounded, is helpless to stop them. By the time, the Feds get to the bus, Miles is in the wind. When Danny is freed, he comes out and punches Aiken in the face. He tells them that if Miles had died, everyone on the bus would have been blown up. Hank shows up, while Danny gets his wound treated. Danny is upset that he was so close to Molly and couldn't help her. Hank consoles him, telling him that he has located the man who helped Miles - Anthony Deluso. He has his location and they will go find him. Danny tells him to be careful as he leaves.\n\nRound 8 - Santiago approaches Danny and offers his help. Danny calls the number on the envelope. Miles tells him that there are 5 numbers inside the envelope. Four of them are for cell phones wired to bombs in different city locations. Only one will disarm all 4 of them. If he dials wrong, the bomb attached to the receiving phone will explode. If he doesn't dial within 1 minute, all 4 will explode. Realizing that the numbers are codes, Danny and Santiago start inputting the numbers as text messages. With no time left, Danny dials one randomly. Miles answers and tells him he got it wrong.\n\nRound 9 - He tells them that Streetcar 907's brakes have been disabled and the radio is out. Danny's task is to stop the streetcar before it causes a lot of damage. Danny and Santiago drive off. Santiago tries to call the DoT about it, but is put on hold. Danny says that the best way to stop it would be to shut down its power.\n\nMeanwhile, Hank and his team prepare to raid Deluso's apartment. However Deluso gets wind of it and bails. Hank and another cop follow Deluso through the streets on foot.\n\nIn Streetcar 907, the driver realizes the brakes are shot and the radio is out. He tries to stop the car but it won't. Danny swerves his car in front of the streetcar, trying to slow it down. He tries to climb on top of it and take out the power from the roof, but to no avail. He gets back in the car and drives towards a nearby power transformer. He and Santiago jump out just in time as the car slams into the power transformer, shutting off electricity for the whole neighborhood. The streetcar, now powerless, slows down, but not by much. Danny and Santiago run along it, clearing people out of the way, until it grinds to a halt.\n\nRound 10 & 11 - Miles calls Danny. Danny jokes that it's getting too easy. Miles tells Danny that Round 10 was him and Hank taking Deluso. So Round 11 is where he takes his best friend, Hank. Fearing the worst, Danny tries calling Hank, but it keeps going to voice-mail.\n\nIn a welding factory, Hank walks carefully, gun at the ready, looking for Deluso. He finds himself at gunpoint. Deluso taunts him, telling him that Miles always plans for stuff like this. Suddenly, an anti-personnel mine activates. Hank taunts him back, saying that he doesn't feature in Miles' plans. The mine explodes, killing Hank and Deluso.\n\nDanny gets word from Aiken that the welding factory blew up and Hank was seen entering it. It's a good bet that he didn't make it. Danny is heartbroken. Aiken goes up to him and tells him that, some time ago, Miles stole 3 Stingers from the military. They were tracked to Pakistan, but Aiken lost Miles on the day of the deal. A few days later, one of the stolen Stingers shot down a plane over Islamabad. He shows Danny the yellow toy car he carries around with him. It was the only thing that was intact in the wreckage. He had forgotten that it isn't about Miles, but about the people he's hurt and those he's going to hurt. Aiken volunteers to help Danny find Molly.\n\nRound 12 - Miles calls Danny. He tells him that, in a few minutes, it will be exactly one year since Erica's death. All Danny has to do is find Molly. She has a bomb strapped to her chest and only Danny's fingerprint on the touchphone, wired to it, can disarm it. He tells Danny to pay a visit to Erica, so he can say he's sorry. He hangs up. They realize he means Erica's tombstone. Danny, Santiago and Aiken get into a car and start for the cemetery. Danny's phone rings. It's Chuck Jansen, another detective. He tells Danny that something was not making sense. All the numbers in the envelope were of cell phones rigged to the streetcar. Miles also had a camera in the elevator shaft, where Willie died. He had blown the bomb early. Danny realizes that Willie was meant to die. He asks Aiken what he's missing. Aiken realizes its about money. He tells Santiago to get all the info about Willie Dumaine. Santiago finds that Willie had a second job as a security guard. They think back to the hotel incident. The gas line had come loose, so they evacuated a few city blocks around it. One of those buildings was the Department of Engraving and Printing - the Mint.\n\nMeanwhile, Miles, dressed as a security guard, uses Willie's card to gain entrance to the Mint. He uses a false name to sign in. He follows another security guard as they're led to the safe. The money there is over one hundred million dollars. Having killed all the other guards, Miles dumps the money down into the sewer.\n\nAiken tells Santiago to lock down the Mint, while he and Danny go after Molly. As they drive, Danny wonders how Miles will get the money out of the place. Aiken tells him only emergency vehicles can get through. Danny suddenly thinks back to when he hijacked the firetruck. He turns the car around and heads for the Mint.\n\nMiles emerges from the sewer, near the Hotel Monteleone, where the firetruck (which Danny hijacked) is parked. He uses the hose to siphon out the water and money into the truck.\n\nDanny tells Aiken that Molly's not at the cemetery. She's a nurse and Miles' ticket out. Aiken calls the hospital security.\n\nAt the hospital, Miles uses an explosion as a diversion and heads into the hospital. Inside, he forces Molly to help him wheel the soaking wet money (inside a bodybag) up to the top of the hospital, to the helipad. He kills two hospital guards in the process. They head for the Medevac chopper. He tells her to take them up.\n\nDanny and Aiken race into the hospital. Molly tries to stall, giving them time to reach the chopper. Miles shoots at them, wounding Aiken. Danny leaps and grabs onto the chopper. He and Miles fight inside the chopper, with Molly using the chopper to help Danny out. However, the engine gets hit by gunfire and the chopper starts to lose control. Miles activates the touchphone-bomb. Danny, though wounded, punches Miles' lights out, before he and Molly jump out of the chopper into a terrace pool, just as time runs out. Miles gets blown to bits inside the helicopter. Aiken, happily, throws his yellow toy car away.\n\nDanny and Molly slowly and painfully trudge downstairs, while Danny starts to tell Molly about the house while credits roll~"

Once the building is evacuated, Darrow takes over security control to monitor Shaw's whereabouts and he initiates the total lockdown and disables all the phone communication and networks. Shaw has only 12 rounds left in his gun and makes good use of it.\n\nAll of the people have now evacuated except the Officer Taylor, newly graduated from the academy, has being locked inside despite she is using the card key. Shaw sees Officer Meeks, worked on Burke to find Shaw, then held hostage as Burke appears. Seeing this opportunity, Burke shoots Meeks and Shaw drags his body into the elevator. All throughout, Burke frames Shaw for a homicide he didn't commit. With Shaw is still on the elevator, Burke radios Darrow to shut the elevator, but he managed to escape before they find him.\n\nShaw goes to the locker room but the henchman confronts him and the two have fight. Shaw ultimately kills the henchman by pounding the head with the barbell weight. Then, Shaw meets Taylor and he told her to hide, not telling Taylor what's going on inside the building. Shaw goes to the parking lot which is Darrow alerts the men for his presence. Shaw goes for hide beside the car but as the henchman moving behind him, he fires two rounds at him. After the henchmen fires at Shaw, he makes an escape by driving while finding an exit. Shaw is hit by the bullet to his arm. The henchmen continue firing at the car but they find out that Shaw went to the nearest entrance.\n\nBurke sees Taylor and invited her to walk with him to the security control. Burke then speaks through the PA system with Taylor, asking her brief questions, and then he tells Shaw to show himself at the CCTV camera where he can see any in the monitors in five seconds or else he will going to shoot Taylor. Shaw shows himself to the camera and then he alerts his men that he is on the first floor. Burke then shoots Taylor anyway and the gunshot is heard by Shaw.\n\nAfter he outran the henchmen, he goes to the office to put the bandage in the wounded arms. Shaw tries to escape as Burke and his henchmen see him. The henchmen now surround him, but he gives a chance to escape by firing a Taser to the man he killed; enable the handed gun to fire at Burke and his men. Shaw heads to the server room and messes the wires to disable the CCTV cameras. Shaw then reactivates the network in order to upload the evidence regarding Burke to the police department. However, Darrow notices that the network is activated and he struggles to deactivate it. Unfortunately for Shaw that Darrow successfully deactivated the network just moments before it finishes the upload. Frustrated by this, Shaw goes to the rooftop in order to get the signal and make call to Matthews. Shaw convinces Matthews that he is the innocent and Burke is corrupt at all. The henchman found him and after some fight, Shaw pinned out the grenade, blowing him.\n\nShaw then sees Burke and put a cuff on him. After they got into the elevator, Burke secretly has its own key and manages to unlock the cuff, and tries to subdue Shaw. He goes out of the elevator with Burke still inside. The three henchmen fires at Shaw, hitting the bullet on his hip. Shaw then goes to the office to put some bandage in the wounded hip. After that, Shaw aims his gun to the henchwoman but she tries to subdue him until he fatally shoots her. After Shaw manages to kill another henchman, by stabbing his neck with the knife, Darrow and Burke capture him.\n\nBoth held Shaw capture inside the room and ask him where the evidence is. As Shaw hands it over to Burke, he quickly destroys that. Burke then manages to incapacitate Shaw but as the SWAT Team cuts the power, Shaw gives an opportunity to kill Darrow and try to fight between the two.\n\nAfter being encountered with the SWAT Team, Shaw calls Matthews to meet her at the back of the building. Finally, Matthews make it to meet him, but only to reveal herself that he is working with Burke. He then shoots Matthews to make even think that Shaw kill her. After a several minutes of confronting Shaw, the SWAT Team burst inside and he assumes to them that Shaw kill her. Before Shaw is about to be arrested, he plays a recording of Burkes confession to them. Burke attempt to shoot Shaw but he fires the last round to his leg. Shaw cuffs his hand and walks out to the building."

    "12 Strong": "Mitch Nelson (Chris Hemsworth) (ODA 595's commander), a U.S. Army captain with Green Berets Operational Detachment Alpha (ODA) 595, is moving into a new home with his wife and daughter on September 11, 2001, after receiving an assignment to staff duty under Lieutenant Colonel Bowers (Rob Riggle) (Commander of 3rd Battalion, 5th Special Forces Group). The US know that the attack was sponsored by Al-Qaeda, who has sanctuary in Afghanistan.\n\nAs news of the devastating terrorist attacks that daybreak, Nelson volunteers to lead 595 into Afghanistan. Bowers initially refuses, but veteran soldier CW5 Hal Spencer (Michael Shannon) (a Chief Warrant Officer 5 and ODA 595's assistant team leader), previously scheduled to retire, persuades Bowers to give Nelson command of 595 again (Hal takes back his retirement papers & Stands up for Nelson, who has never been in combat and has only led the team in training for 2 years), as well as volunteering himself for the deployment. After leaving their families, 595 travels to Uzbekistan on October 7, 2001. After being briefed and evaluated by COL Mulholland (William Fichtner), Commander of 5th Special Forces Group, Nelson and 595 are picked to fight alongside Northern Alliance leader Abdul Rashid Dostum (Navid Negahban). Their mission is to help Dostum take over Mazar-I-Sharif and put a serious dent in Taliban's ability to prop Al-Qaeda. Mulholland gives Nelson 6 weeks, but Nelson retorts that in 3 weeks the harsh winter will shut down all mountain passes. So, they have just 3 weeks. Mulholland is impressed with Nelson's smarts and picks his group from the 6 team options available at his command.\n\nBen Milo (Trevante Rhodes), a Sergeant First Class in ODA 595. Sean Coffers (Geoff Stults), member of ODA 595. Vern Michaels (Thad Luckinbill), member of ODA 595. Scott Black (Ben O'Toole), member of ODA 595. Bill Bennett (Kenny Sheard), a Sergeant First Class in ODA 595. Fred Falls (Austin Stowell), a Staff Sergeant in ODA 595. Pat Essex (Austin H\u00e9bert), a Master Sergeant in ODA 595. Charles Jones (Jack Kesy), member of ODA 595. Kevin Jackson (Kenneth Miller), member of ODA 595.\n\nODA 595 is inserted covertly in Afghanistan aboard an MH-47 Chinook flown by 160th SOAR on 19 October 2001 (The Chinook must fly at 25K ft to avoid missiles that can be fired by Taliban forces from mountains that are as high as 10K ft. There is no oxygen on board and the team can go Hypoxic). They land 40 miles south of Mazar-i Sharif, the country's fourth-largest city and a long-time stronghold of the Taliban, where they meet Dostum. Their CIA contact informs them that the Northern Alliance is split into 3 militias who are rivals and don't coordinate with each other. If they meet in battle, they will forget the Taliban and fight each other instead. Dostum is an Uzbek and was fighting Russian since he was 16. He is 55 now and is now fighting the Taliban.\n\nSix of the 12 members, led by Nelson, leave with Dostum to the mountains (as Dostum had only 6 extra horses), while the other six remain in a fortified camp nicknamed \"The Alamo\" under Spencer's command. Dostum is attempting to capture the northern Afghanistan city, while battling Taliban leader Mullah Razzan (Numan Acar), who rules local communities brutally under strict Sharia law (killing women who encourage their girls to study), and has murdered several people, including Dostum's family. Although the warlord is initially skeptical of Nelson's abilities (Nelson and his team are also suspicious of Dostum as the camps he picks for rest are in a GPS and radio dead zone. Nelson fears Dostum might be setting them up to be sold to the Taliban for bounty), Nelson gradually earns Dostum's respect (Nelson gets close to Taliban forces (even face of a firefight) to give exact GPS coordinates to the bombers to drop their loads and cause heavy casualties). In one battle, however, Dostum makes a tactical error (he attacks a heavily fortified Taliban town without US air force support. The bombers were out of fuel and were heading back but Dostum didn't bother to check with Nelson before attacking), costing several casualties. Dostum is not willing to put US army soldiers in harm's way as if even one of them dies, the US forces leave, and they lose the war against Taliban. Meanwhile Mulholland has doubts about the route Nelson is taking (and also because he can't speak to Nelson directly) and decides to introduce a 2nd team to advance on Mazar-I-Sharif.\n\nNelson accuses Dostum of acting carelessly with the lives of his men and of withholding valuable information, while Dostum retorts that he still feels that Nelson, and the U.S. are not willing to pay the potential price (blood) of the conflict and tells Nelson that he needs to use his heart and mind to \"be a warrior\" instead of a soldier. The two eventually reconcile, and, after splitting off a three-man element under SFC Sam Diller (Michael Pe\u00f1a) (ODA 595's intelligence Sergeant First Class) to strike a Taliban supply route and being joined by Hal Spencer's half of ODA 595, continue to work together. Hal has a slipped disc but continues to carry his own weight. They win several victories with Dostum's leadership and manpower and American air-power, making significant progress towards Mazar-i Sharif. When Nelson informs Dostum that another ODA, 555, has been dispatched to support Atta Muhammad, another Northern Alliance leader, who is Dostum's political rival, Dostum is furious, and his men promptly abandon 595.\n\nFollowing Dostum's departure, Nelson plans to continue operating against the Taliban with his Americans and the few Afghan fighters remaining with them. Encountering a large force of Al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters and armored vehicles, ODA 595, re-joined by Diller and his element, uses air support to eliminate many of the fighters and most of the armor, but are discovered and attacked. Spencer is critically injured by a suicide bomber, and the team is about to be overrun under heavy Taliban and Al-Qaeda pressure when Dostum returns with his forces. Carrying out the U.S. Army's first cavalry charge of the 21st century, the American and Northern Alliance forces disperse the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, and Dostum tracks down and kills Razzan. After Spencer is med-evacuated, Nelson and Dostum continue to Mazar-i-Sharif but find Atta Muhammad has beaten them there. Against expectations, Dostum and Muhammad meet peacefully and put aside their differences. Impressed by Nelson and the Americans' efforts, Dostum gives Nelson his prized riding crop and tells him that he will always consider Nelson a brother and fellow fighter, at the same time bidding him remember that Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires. Spencer ultimately survives, and all 12 soldiers of ODA 595 return home after 23 days of almost continuous fighting in Afghanistan.\n\nThe film's penultimate moment shows a photo of the Horse Soldier Statue at the World Trade Center in New York City, based on the soldiers of ODA 595 and their victory in the early stages of the response to the September 11th attacks, dedicated to all United States Special Forces. The film then ends with a photo of the actual members of ODA 595, in combat fatigues, upon whom 12 Strong was based."

    "13 Assassins": "The film is set in 1840s Japan during the final decades of the Tokugawa shogunate. The sadistic younger stepbrother of the current Shogun, Lord Matsudaira Naritsugu of Akashi, sexually assaults and kills at will. Sir Doi Toshitsura (Mikijiro Hira), the Shogun's Justice, realizes the situation will become more dangerous after Naritsugu ascends to a higher political position. After a wronged party of the Mimiya family, publicly commits Harakiri (Harakiri denotes the only way in ancient Japanese way in which slaves demonstrate rejection of their masters. Harakiri means that a slave would rather die by slashing their body rather than continue slaving) as a way of showing disdain for Lord Naritsugu, Sir Doi seeks out a trusted older samurai, Shinzaemon, who served under the former shogun. Sir Doi secretly hires him to assassinate Naritsugu. However, Naritsugu's loyal retainers - led by Hanbei; an old contemporary of Shinzaemon - learn of the plot by spying on Doi's meetings. Naritsugu is so ruthless that he slaughters the entire Mimiya family in cold blood, despite Hanbei pleading with him to leave them alone. But despite the incident, Hanbei is sworn to protect Naritsugu.\n\nShinzaemon gathers 11 more samurai, whom Sir Doi knows can be trusted including Shinzaemon's nephew, Shinroukuro. The 12 plan to ambush Naritsugu on his official journey from Edo back to his lands in Akashi. However just before they leave, Hanbei arrives and warns his old colleague that he will suffer grave consequences if he tries to kill Naritsugu.\n\nThe group, with the legal authority and financial assistance of Sir Doi, buy the help of town Ochiai in order to create a trap. They also enlist the help of a minor lord whose daughter-in-law was sexually assaulted, and son murdered by Naritsugu. With troops, he blocks the official highway forcing Naritsugu to head for the town and the trap. During the assassin's own journey to the town, they are attacked by Ronin paid off by Hanbei to kill the plotters.\n\nThe group decides to head through the mountains but end up getting lost. In the process they encounter a hunter named Kiga Koyata who becomes their guide, and they adopt him as the thirteenth assassin. The town is converted into an elaborate maze of booby traps and camouflaged fortifications. However, when Naritsugu and his retinue arrive their numbers have been swelled with additional troops. The 13 assassins were no longer facing 70 men-at-arms now there were 200. A lengthy battle follows with Naritsugu and his guards trapped inside the village and attacked on all sides by arrows, explosives, knives, and swords - with the exception of Koyata who fights with rocks in slings. Against this carnage, the deranged noble, Naritsugu, is excited by the violence claiming it's the most fun he has ever. He tells Hanbei that when he ascends to the Shogun's counsel, he will bring back the wars of the Sengoku period.\n\nSlowly the assassins are killed but not before they inflict heavy casualties on the Akashi forces. Eventually Naritsugu and Hanbei are cornered by Shizaemon and Shinrokuro. After Shizaemon kills Hanbei, Naritsugu kicks his loyal retainers head away insulting the older samurai. Contemptuously Naritsugu announces that both the people and samurai have only one purpose and that is to serve their lords. But Shizaemon counters by telling Naritsugu that lords can't live without the support of the people, and that if a lord abuses his powers the people will always rise against them. Naritsugu and Shinzaemon both mortally wound each other. As the lord crawls away in mud crying and experiencing fear and pain for the first time, he thanks Shinzaemon for showing him excitement before Shinzaemon chops his head off.\n\nAfter Shinzaemon dies, Shinrokuro wanders through the carnage. He meets the hunter Koyata who has made a miraculous recovery after being stabbed in the neck by Naritsugu. The pair then make their own ways out of the town. An epilogue states that the Shogun and his government covered up what really occurred announcing that Naritsugu died of illness on the journey back to his lands. In 23 years, the Tokugawa Shogunate would be overthrown with the Meiji Restoration."

    "13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi": "In 2012, after deposing the dictator Gadaffi, rival local militant factions have repeatedly raided Gadaffi's armories for weapons. As a result, a deadly civil war has broken out which has made Benghazi the most dangerous place on the planet. In 2012, Benghazi, Libya is named one of the most dangerous places in the world, and countries have pulled their embassies out of the country in fear of an attack by militants. The United States, however, still has a diplomatic compound (not an official embassy) open in the city. Less than a mile away is a not-so-secret CIA outpost called \"The Annex\", which is protected by a team of 6 private military contractors from Global Response Staff made up of former military special operations personnel. New to the detail is Jack \"Da\" Silva (John Krasinski), who arrives in Benghazi and is picked up by Tyrone S. \"Rone\" Woods (James Dale), a member of the team and a personal friend of Silva. Arriving at the Annex, Da Silva is introduced to the rest of the team and the chief (David Costabile), who constantly gives the team strict reminders to never engage the citizens to avoid conflict with local militants in the area. The chief also believes that there is no real threat in Libya as he believes the Libyans are thankful to Americans for supporting their revolution. He is not supportive of the armed non-CIA protective detail guarding his compound, as he feels they are a threat to their security.\n\nThe U.S. Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens (Matt Letscher) arrives in Benghazi to maintain diplomatic connections in the middle of the political and social chaos. Despite warnings, Ambassador Stevens decides to stay at the Special Mission with limited protection from a pair of Diplomatic Security (DS) agents and guards hired from the local February 17th Martyrs Brigade militia, nicknamed \"17-Feb\". On the morning of the eleventh anniversary of the September 11 attacks, Stevens notices suspicious men taking pictures of the compound and notifies his security detail. Back at the Annex, the GRS team communicates with their families and Da Silva finds out that his wife is pregnant.\n\nThat night, a group of Islamist militants from Ansar Al-Sharia assault the compound. Unwilling to work as protective guards for $28 a day, the local 17-Feb guards quickly surrender their posts, allowing the attackers easy access to the Special Mission compound. This first attack happens around 9 pm. Scott Wickland (Davd Giuntoli), a Diplomatic Security agent, takes Stevens and an officer, Sean Smith (Christopher Dingli), into the safe room. Unable to breach the safe room, the attackers set the building on fire hoping to burn the men out.\n\nWickland is able to escape but loses both Stevens and Smith. At the Annex, the GRS team desperately wants to go to the compound to help, but the chief refuses, fearing that the GRS team's departure would leave the Annex vulnerable. meanwhile the Embassy in Tripoli has no military assets to help the team in Benghazi and the African Command in Germany requires 45 mins and an approval from the white House to respond to this crisis. Refusing to listen, the GRS team dispatches to the compound and meets up with the DS agents. Silva and Woods go into the building to try to find Stevens and Smith, but are only able to find Smith, who has died from smoke inhalation. The team retreats back to the Annex. The team from the compound also follows suit, but after Wickland goes the wrong direction, they are followed back to the Annex. The cars enter the Annex at around 12 am.\n\nKnowing an attack by the militants is imminent, the staff of the CIA Annex make several desperate calls for help. The only help they can get is from Glen \"Bub\" Doherty (Toby Stephens), a Global Response Staff officer based in the US Embassy in Tripoli, who forms a team including two Delta operators that flies to Benghazi after several delays. Meanwhile, the GRS team fends off the militants as they try to breach the Annex perimeter late into the night at around 1 am. As the attackers regroup after failed assaults, the GRS team takes time to regroup as well, and the downtime allows them to think about their families while considering the gravity of the situation. After repelling the largest attack wave, the Annex receives word from ISR that help is in route from Croatia in form a strike package of fighter aircraft & helicopter laden with reinforcements. This is around 3 am.\n\nWith the GRS team compromised, and the Annex now vulnerable, the remaining GRS operators watch as a convoy of vehicles rolls toward the Annex at 5 30 am. Fearing the worst, the operators prepare to make a final stand, until it is revealed that the convoy is an element of the Libya Shield Force militia escorting the GRS reinforcements. They also find out that Stevens was found behind the compound but was pronounced dead at the hospital from smoke inhalation. The militants launch a mortar attack at 6 am that wounds one of the DS agents and kills both Woods and Doherty. But the GRS team is able to withstand the onslaught of the militia and push them back. The promised air support never came. At 6 15 am a huge convoy of 50 vehicles rolls towards the annex. As the team preps for the final stand, they realize that this is the rescue team they have been waiting for all along. The entire annex is evacuated, and the CIA team leaves Benghazi by 8 30 am. The GRS team stays behind for their plane. As the remainder of the team wait at the airstrip with the bodies of Stevens, Smith, Woods and Doherty, they reflect on the events that happened and how they will most likely receive no recognition for defending the Annex as they were off the books. They are finally evacuated at 10 30 am. Closing titles reveal that all of the surviving members of the Annex security team received medals in a private ceremony and have since retired from the GRS team and live with their families."

    "13Hrs": "Sarah Tyler (Isabella Calthorpe) is driving along a winding road one night in order to return to her home in England. after a couple of years of staying in the Los Angeles in the United States. When she arrives, she greets her step-father who is working his way through a couple of paperworks. Sarah told her step-father to rest that night while she takes care of her brothers who are at the barn fixing a jeep. Sarah left the house to go to the family's barn nearby while a storm is brewing. She saw her brothers with their friends having a party at the barn. Among those partying were Stephen Moore (Peter Gadiot) and his girlfriend Emily (Gemma Atkinson), Charlie Moore (Gabriel Thomson), Gary Ashby (Tom Felton), and Doug Walker (Joshua Bowman). Also in the barn away from the noise of the party is their youngest brother Luke Moore (Anthony de Liseo) asleep amongst the hay together with their dog Stoner. Sarah woke up Luke and learned that their parents were fighting over bills and a supposed love affair of their mother with another man. She told Luke to go back to sleep and sent Stoner back home. Sarah then joined the party where she asked why she was kept out of the loop for so long. Stephen then told her that her step father accused their mother of having an affair with someone and that she is paying this man huge sums of money. Sarah can't believe that her mother is having an affair. Everyone went back to the house. There was a power outage caused by the storm. Inside, the pack went up the stairs and noticed blood dripping at the top of the stairs. Meanwhile, Gary separates from the group and ended up in the kitchen in order to look for candles. The group upstairs followed the marks of blood on the carpet and they saw that it came from their father's room. When they entered the room, everyone was shocked to see the lifeless body of their father that seemed to have been attacked by some wild animal. The rib cage can clearly be seen with some internal organs missing. Almost at the same time, Gary saw some candles and dropped them. When he reached down to get them, he saw the collar of Stoner and the bloody remains of the dog. The group upstairs suddenly saw a beast like creature which immediately attacked them. Luckily, they were able to close the door before the beast could reach them. The beast keeps on pounding furiously against the closed door when Gary called out to them. The beast immediately heard Gary and went after him and killed him the same way - ripping his internal organs out. The creature then started to go back to the closed door and furiously tried to break it open. Sarah and group then fled to the bathroom of their father's room and closed the door there. When the beast started to pound the door of the bathroom also, Sarah saw a passageway inside the bathroom going to the attic. Everyone went up it and for a moment in time they were saved. In the attic, the group contemplated on what they are going to do. Sarah mentioned that they needed to get help and her mobile phone is in her bag downstairs. Stephen's phone is dead. Sarah remembered Luke was left sleeping at the barn. Sarah then said that there is a phone in their father's room. Emily saw a pathway in the attic that leads to another opening in another room. They devised a plan in order to get to the phone. Sarah would go down through the other pathway and make distract the beast while Charlie goes down to their father's bathroom back into their father's room and use the phone there to call for help. The monster heard Sarah's screams to get it's attention and ran towards her. Meanwhile, Charlie was able to reach the phone and he tried calling the police. Sarah went back to the other opening in the attic when she noticed that the creature had stopped following her. She went outside to look for the creature and realized that it is after Charlie. Charlie was able to contact the police and mentioned about the wild animal in their house before he was attacked and killed by the beast. Sarah saw that Charlie was already being devoured by the beast. It then went after Sarah, who immediately tried to go back up the attic. Unfortunately, the beast was able to get hold and bite her leg before she managed to make her way up to the attic. On the other side of town, McRae was picked up by police officer May. Apparently they were sent to investigate the call made by Charlie about wild animals being loose at their home. McRae is a trained dog catcher and was enlisted by the police department to help in resolving the situation. May thinks that the report is a hoax but went there instead to be sure. Back in the attic, Stephen was hysterical while Doug was treating Sarah's leg lacerations. Stephen crawled in the attic away from Sarah and Doug while Emily followed him. Stephen saw another passageway from the attic which lead to another room containing a shotgun. Once inside the room, Sarah and Doug warned them that the beast is lurking outside the room and told them to get out. Emily and Stephen manage to block the door after a little bit of struggle. While Emily is looking for shotgun cartridges, Stephen leaves her and crawls back up to the attic. Sarah armed with a stake makes her way down where she injures the beast before it attacks Emily. All of them meet up at the attic where an outraged Emily starts screaming and threatening a scared Stephen. She takes the shotgun and says she will kill the beast herself. The beast manages to surprise Emily where she takes a shot at it but unfortunalety falls and ends up shooting herself which results in her death. Meanwhile, McRae with officer May see an abandoned car in the middle of the road and stop to investigate. They come to the conclusion, after finding that the woman did not take her handbag, that the car broke down but the driver seeking for help never made it back so the call they received earlier may not be a hoax. As they leave, a pile of clothes is shown a few feet away from the car. Luke wakes up and goes back to the house unaware of the situation that is going on. He finds Gary's dead body in the hall way. The beast, now aware of his presence, is after him. Sarah eventually falls through the ceiling. As she quickly recovers she helps Luke and all of the remaining survivors make their way to the roof. McRae and officer May arrive at the house but both get killed by the beast. Sarah manages to reach the police vehicle where she takes the handbag and then all of them run towards the barn where Stephen tries to fix the Jeep. Sarah discovers that the handbag belonged to her mother, it is also revealed that Stephen tampered with his mother's car so that he can delay her from seeing her lover. Sarah says that if their mother is dead then Stephen is the one to blame. An upset Stephen knocks her unconscious but Sarah awakens and hits Stephen. A scared Stephen runs out of the barn and he is attacked by the beast. Inside the barn Sarah starts to transforms into a monstrous figure. Luke and Doug run back to the house where the beast comes back. They hide under the table and just as soon as the beast is about to kill them, a beast-like Sarah attacks and fights with the other beast. Luke runs back to the car while Doug tries to shoot at the beast but is eventually bitten and killed by Sarah. In the morning Sarah has returned to her human self. The other beast is revealed to be Sarah's mother. Sarah finds Luke inside the car and they both drive off to go somewhere safe. Just before the credits roll, it is revealed that Gary is still alive."

Oleg is interested in photography and movies, and spouts on to the customs agent.\n\nAcross town Robert Hawkins (Kelsey Grammer) is arguing with his assistant Cassandra (Kim Cattrall) about his news network, stating that tragedy sells more. Cassandra wants to raise ratings, and they decide to film Detective Eddie Fleming (Robert DeNiro) as he does a stakeout. Eddie is a drunk, but a regular media attraction when sober. Eddie preps for his bust, and Robert's film crew follows the action, but misses the key scene.\n\nOleg goes \"shopping\" for a camera, then films Emil as they arrive at Milos's (Vladimir Mashkov) apartment to collect their share of a bank job. Milos tells Emil that Oleg got them caught and an argument ensures. Email wants his money, but Milos does not have it. Emil stabs Milos and strangles his wife, while Oleg films and neighbor Daphne (Vera Farmiga) watches, hidden. Emil hears her leaving but cannot stop her. Emil hides the bodies with a \"Bohemian BBQ\", dousing them in acetone.\n\nFire Marshal Jordy Warsaw (Edward Burns) gets the call for the fire. After subduing a would-be mugger, he arrives at the apartment fire, crossing paths with Eddie. Jordy finds a timer and deduces the fire is a homicide. Daphne tries to flag Jordy down, but the crowd is too big.\n\nEmil has Daphne's wallet, and realizes she is in the country illegally. He finds a card for an escort service and calls the number, asking for a Czech girl. He and oleg start learning American values from shows like Rosie O'Donnell and Robert Hawkin's. The hooker arrives, and Emil tries to get information from her, but she knows nothing, and Emil kills her.\n\nJordy and his partner Bobby (John DiResta) return to the fire station and are rebuked by Fire Chief Marshal Declan Duffy (James Handy) for handing evidence to Eddie. Jordy tries to get a sketch of Daphne, sensing she has a story to tell. He returns to the burned-out apartment and finds Eddie. Eddie gets a call about the dead hooker, and tags along. Eddie deduces that there were two killers, and the murder weapon may match the one used on Milos.\n\nEddie and Jordy visit the escort service and talk to Rose (Charlize Theron). Rose recognizes Daphne from the police sketch, and also reveals that Emil and Oleg were inquiring about her. Eddie and Jordy race to the nail salon where Daphne works. Oleg and Emil are already there (Oleg filming, getting his \"15 minutes of fame\"). Emil gives her a warning, and they leave right before Jordy arrives. The cops see them and give chase, but they escape, beating Detective Jackson (Avery Brooks) and stealing his wallet/gun, and also shooting Bobby. Eddie fires a shot, hitting Emil in the foot, but they escape.\n\nEddie and Jordy interview Daphne, and she reveals that she once shot a cop who was raping her sister. Jordy asks to interview her alone, since she is scared. Daphne tries to get Jordy to let her shower before going to the police station.\n\nEddie meets with his girlfriend Nicolette (Melina Kanakaredes), and tries to propose to her in Greek. Nicolette is a reporter, and gets an urgent call from the network, right in the middle of his proposal.\n\nEmail and Oleg go through Detective Jackson's wallet and find Eddie's home address. At the police station, Jordy's boss complains to him about the shower, but Eddie covers for him, although he laters tells Jordy it was a mistake.\n\nAt home, Eddie is working on his proposal routine when Oleg and Emil show up and knock him out. When he comes to, they have bound him to a chair. Emil lays out his plan: he will plead insanity to the murders, based on the fact that they film their murders, and will later write books about their experience (like they've seen on TV). Eddie fights them, but is stabbed to death.\n\nAt Eddie's wake, Emil calls Robert and tells him he has a film of Eddie's death, and wants to sell it. Robert pays them. Meanwhile, Jordy takes Daphne to her apartment to collect her things, and the light switch starts a booby-trap - fire. Oleg and Email watch from an adjacent building. They leave as the fire department arrives, and Jordy escapes with Daphne.\n\nMeanwhile, the police have learned about the tape of Eddie's death, and try to get it before it's broadcast.

    "1911": "Jackie Chan's 100th movie: Starring Jackie Chan and co-directed by the star and Zhang Li, 1911 tells the story of the founding of the Republic of China when Sun Yat-sens forces overthrew the Qing Dynasty. Sun is played by look-alike Chinese actor Zhao Wen Xuan. Li Bingbing, Joan Chen and Jaycee Chan also star. This is a dramatic movie, of which Jackie Chan hopes will show the United States his ability to act in a drama. Chan plays a high ranking military officer (seems as if he is a general). It is expected that no Kung-Fu will be used, although lots battles with the use of guns in a war type setting with weapons from the time period of 1911, what was accurately used in the Overthrowing of the Qing Dynasty by the hands of Sun Yat-sen's forces. Originally Jackie Chan's 100th film was going to be \"Armor of God 3: Chinese Zodiac\" but due to Shaolin (2011) and this dramatic role which is currently under the post production phase., \"Armor of God 3: Chinese Zodiac\" and its release has been pushed back to what would appear to be 2012, unless Chan is able to release both movies. The film started shooting in September 2010 and will be released in October 2011."

    "1917": "At the height of the First World War in April 1917 in northern France, two young British soldiers, Lance Corporal Will Schofield (George MacKay) and Lance Corporal Tom Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman), are given a mission directly by General Erinmore (Colin Firth) to hand-deliver a message to the 2nd Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment, calling off their planned attack on the German forces. The Germans have feigned retreat to the Hindenburg Line (it is 3 miles deep, artillery, defenses and fortifications never seen before) and are prepared to ambush the battalion of 1,600 men, Blake's brother Lieutenant Joseph Blake (Richard Madden) among them. Erinmore has aerial photos that show the German fortifications which will destroy the advance of the Devonshire Regiment, who aims to attack at dawn the following morning. As all phone lines are cut there is no other way to get the message across.\n\nSchofield wants to wait till dark, but Blake wants to save his brother and leaves immediately. They are 9 miles from their destination. It should take them 6-8 hours to get there at the most. Lieutenant Leslie (Andrew Scott) is in command of the trench from where the duo have to access the No man's land. Leslie doesn't believe Erinmore's analysis and says that the Germans are still manning their trenches. He calls it a trap but shows them the best way across the No Man's Land.\n\nSchofield and Blake cross no man's land to reach the abandoned German trenches, but Schofield injures his left hand along the way (when it snags in the 2nd line of barbed wire). In an underground barracks (the duo finds massive under bunkers in the German trenches with cots for soldiers to sleep), they discover a tripwire set by the Germans, which is promptly triggered by a rat; the explosion almost kills Schofield, but Blake saves him, and the two escape.\n\nThey arrive at an abandoned farmhouse (Schofield fills his water flask with milk he finds in a bucket), where a German plane is shot down in a dogfight with Allied aircraft. Schofield and Blake save the burned pilot from the wreck. Blake persuades Schofield to get water for the pilot. When Schofield's back is turned, the pilot stabs Blake. Schofield shoots the pilot dead and comforts Blake as he dies, promising to complete the mission and to write to Blake's mother. Taking Blake's rings and dog tag, as well as Erinmore's letter, he is picked up by a passing British unit (led by Captain Smith (Mark Strong)) and dropped off near the bombed-out village of Ecoust-Saint-Mein. Smith tells Schofield to have witnesses when he gives the orders to Mackenzie. Smith knows that some men just want a fight and Mackenzie may not call off the attack even after being ordered.\n\nA destroyed canal bridge near Ecoust-Saint-Mein prevents the British lorries from crossing, and Schofield chooses to part with them. He uses what is left of the bridge to cross alone and comes under fire from a sniper. Exchanging shots, Schofield wounds the sniper and advances, whereupon he and the sniper shoot each other simultaneously; the sniper is killed, while Schofield is struck in the helmet and knocked unconscious. He awakens at night and makes his way through the flare-lit ruins of the town.\n\nAfter evading a German soldier, he discovers a French woman hiding with a presumably orphaned infant. She treats his wounds, and he gives her his canned food and milk from the farm. Despite her pleas, Schofield leaves, after hearing the chimes of a nearby clock and realizing that time is running out. Encountering German soldiers who were occupying Ecoust, he strangles one to death and escapes pursuit by jumping into a river. The river carries him while the cherry blossoms fall. He is swept over a waterfall before reaching the riverbank.\n\nSchofield reaches the 2nd Battalion in the morning only to find that the attack has already begun, and that Blake's brother is among the first wave to go over the top. As the company starts to move toward the front, Schofield tries to reach Colonel Mackenzie (Benedict Cumberbatch).\n\nRealizing that the trenches are too crowded for him to make it to Mackenzie in time, Schofield goes \"over the top\" and sprints on the open battlefield parallel to the British trench line, just as the infantry begins its charge. He forces his way in to meet Mackenzie, who reads the message and reluctantly calls off the attack. Schofield looks for Blake's brother, and finds him, who was among the first wave and is bloodied but unharmed. Schofield informs Joseph of his mission and of Tom's death, passing on Tom's rings and dog tag. Joseph is deeply upset about his brother but thanks Schofield for his efforts. Schofield asks for permission to write to their mother about Tom's heroics, to which Joseph agrees. Exhausted, Schofield sits under a nearby tree and looks at photographs of his family; on the back of one of them is the message Come back to us."

    "1942: A Love Story": "The film is set in 1942, when the British Raj was declining. It was a time when many Indians were either working for the British or rallying in underground meetings and protests against them. General Douglas (Brian Glover) is a brutal office in charge of a province who is ganging revolutionaries by their thousands. In this atmosphere, Naren Singh (Anil Kapoor) falls in love with Rajeshwari \"Rajjo\" Pathak (Manisha Koirala). Their romance is shown developing in spite of the political and social unrest at the time. Raghuvir Pathak (Anupam Kher) (Rajjo's father) wants to assassinate Douglas and knows that he is going visit Kasauni for a brief visit, prior to his departure from India. Pathak decides to relocate to Kasauni so he can work on his plan.\n\nNaren's father Diwan Hari Singh (Manohar Singh) is a loyal British employee in Kasauni, & his mother is Gayatri Devi (Sushma Seth), while Raghuvir Pathak is a revolutionary fighting against British rule. Pathak's associates include Ashutosh (Ashish Vidyarthi), Govind and Shubhankar (Jackie Shroff). Govind is an insider as he is a manager of Hari Singh's estate. Munna (Raghuvir Yadav) is the driver. Abid Ali Baig (Pran) is Raghuvir's mentor and a respected revolutionary. Abid is organizing a play in Douglas's honor and gives Raghuvir the material to make a bomb, that will be used to kill him.\n\nMajor Bisht (Danny Dengzongpa) is a strict Police officer in Kasauni and a British loyal and is in charge of Douglas's security in Kasauli. Naren first sees Rajjo when she arrives in Kasauni with her dad Raghuvir. Naren admits his love to Munna and finally finds Rajjo in the same colony where Munna lives. Munna finds that Rajjo loves to read and spends time in the town library, where Naren goes to woo her. Baig recruits Naren, Rajjo and Bisht's daughter Chanda (Chandni) to help with the play being organized in Douglas's honor. Eventually Rajjo falls in love with Naren. Raghuvir and Govind prepare 3 bombs. Raghuvir is staying in Govind's basement. Bisht has info from police HQ that an attack is planned on Douglas. Chanda meanwhile finds out that Naren has the hots for Rajjo and is heartbroken as she secretly loved Naren herself.\n\nAshutosh arrives in Kasauli to help Raghuvir but is shot by Bisht. He survives and reaches Raghuvir. Rajjo realizes that Raghuvir is a revolutionary. Ashutosh dies in Raghuvir's arms. Rajjo tells Naren the truth and asks him to stay away from her. When Naren asks Raghuvir for Rajjo's hand in marriage, Raghuvir becomes livid. Naren declares that he is willing to sacrifice everything for Rajjo and convinces Raghuvir of his love for her. Pathak relents and tells Naren to talk to his father. When Naren does so, Hari is angry that his son has chosen Rajjo, the daughter of a revolutionary, but pretends that he will do anything for Naren's happiness.\n\nHari eventually tricks Naren into revealing Pathak's secret location and leaks the information to the Bisht. Soon, police barge into Pathak's hideaway and try to kill him, only to find him waiting to light a bomb, killing both himself and the men. Rajjo, realizes what has happened (she thinks Naren betrayed her and her father) and runs away. She is taken into refuge by Shubhankar, a compatriot of Pathak who has learned of his death. Under Shubhankar's tutelage, Rajjo follows her father's revolutionary path. Meanwhile, Naren is angry with his father for using him as a pawn in the ambush and killing of Pathak and driving Rajjo away. Hari Singh is rewarded by the British for this act of treachery. Promising to make up with Rajjo and help her cause, Naren pledges to become a protester or a revolutionary.\n\nGovind is tortured to reveal other accomplices, while Abid Ali takes the remaining 2 bombs made by Raghuvir from Govind's basement. Naren sees this. He begs Abid Ali to reunite him with Rajjo, but he refuses. Naren follows Abid and finds his passing a package to a girl, who turns out to be Rajjo. Naren follows her, not knowing that police were following him. Only timely intervention by Shubhankar saves them both. Bisth circles the entire area and forces Naren to identify the revolutionaries. But Naren says that Shubhankar & Rajjo are not one of them. Unfortunately, the bombs are confiscated by Bisht.\n\nDuring his visit Douglas kills Govind and then kills Munna when he tries to protest. Naren is aghast at this brutality. Chanda tells Bisht that she will join the protests against Dougles the next day. Bisht orders the arrest of Abid Ali, but Shubhankar kills the policemen sent for the arrest. Abid Ali, Shubhankar and Rajjo decide to leave town, but Bisht sees them, so Abid Ali sacrifices himself to save the others. Naren sees this and promises Abid Ali that Shubhankar will have a pistol the next day, in front of Douglas.\n\nNaren severs all ties with his father (he steals Hari's pistol) and stands up against British rule, in front of the city. As he tries to hand over the pistol to Shubhankar, Hari reports the theft to Bisht, who arrests Naren. The attack on Douglas is foiled. Naren is convicted and sentenced to hang for attempted murder.\n\nMoved by Naren's actions, Rajjo tells Shubhankar about him. Shubhankar saves Naren from being hanged and the two finish off Hari and many of the British loyalists. They are helped by Major Bisht (Danny Dengzongpa), who has a change of heart after having witnessed the killing of his daughter Chanda (Chandni), a revolutionary, by the gunshots of British loyalists upon General Douglas' orders (Douglas asked troops to open fire on the gathered crowd as Shubhankar proceeded towards his direction to save Naren).\n\nWith the loyalists dead, Shubhankar hangs General Douglas by the same noose that was intended for Naren. Shubhankar, Rajjo and Naren, together with Major Bisht and the citizens are shown at the end of the movie saluting the Indian flag being hoisted by Shubhankar."

    "2 Guns": "Criminals Robert Trench (Denzel Washington) and Michael Stigman (Mark Wahlberg) are questioned by U.S. Customs after a meeting with drug lord Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos) in Mexico. Unknown to Stigman, Trench is an undercover DEA agent and reports to his superior, Jessup (Robert John Burke), that he failed to acquire cocaine from Greco that they could use as evidence to convict him. Against Jessup's orders, Trench decides to remain undercover and assist Stigman in robbing $3 million from Greco, so they can prosecute Greco for money laundering. Trench later meets with his lover, Deb Rees (Paula Patton), who is involved with another man as well, while Stigman, an undercover Naval Intelligence Officer, meets with his commanding officer, Harold Quince (James Marsden), who instructs Stigman to kill Trench so the Navy can use the stolen money to fund covert operations.\n\nTrench and Stigman are surprised to find $43 million (rather than $3 million) in the vault. After the heist, Stigman follows orders to betray Trench and escape with the money. He suspects Trench is a cop and shoots to wound instead of to kill. Learning of this, Quince attempts to have Stigman killed. Stigman escapes after learning the money will be transferred to a Navy base in Corpus Christi. Meanwhile, a man named Earl (Bill Paxton) aggressively interrogates the bank manager about the money Trench and Stigman stole from him.\n\nTrench visits Jessup to tell him what happened, but Earl and his men are there waiting for him. Earl kills Jessup, frames Trench for the murder and lets him go, making a deal that if Trench returns the $43 million, he will be cleared. Trench goes to Stigman's apartment to find out where he took the money, only to have Stigman contact him from a sniper's post across the street. Trench figures out that Stigman is with the military & no longer has the money with him.\n\nAfter escaping a hit squad sent by Quince, Trench and Stigman kidnap Greco and interrogate him in the garage at Deb's house, where they find out Earl, Greco's associate, is a black ops operative, and that Trench and Stigman had been tricked into stealing money from the CIA. Greco also reveals that all the drug cartels were paying protection money to the CIA in exchange for the CIA transferring their drugs from across the border into USA.\n\nThe garage is attacked by another hit squad, led by Quince. Trench gets suspicious as to how Quince was able to trace Trech and Stigman to Deb's house in the first place. The trio ends up being captured by Greco and taken to his farm in Mexico. After torturing them and receiving a visit from Earl, Greco gives the pair 24 hours to steal the money from the Navy and return it to him, or Deb will die. Stigman & Trench attack the Naval base at Corpus Christi as that's where Stigman thought that Quince had mentioned he was taking the money.\n\nAt the base, Trench infiltrates Quince's office, only to discover Quince is Deb's boyfriend, and they had planned to steal the money for themselves. Meanwhile, Stigman asks Admiral Tuway (Fred Ward) for help. Tuway orders Quince's arrest but disavows Stigman to prevent the scandal from tarnishing the Navy's reputation. Quince evades arrest, as does Stigman. Unable to find the money, Trench is too late to prevent Greco from killing Deb. He later realizes that the money is in a motel room that he and Deb frequented and goes to help Stigman, who had returned to Greco's farm alone.\n\nThere, Stigman is surrounded by Greco's men until both Quince and Earl intervene. Trench arrives in a car filled with money, and then blows up the car, scattering the money everywhere, which leads to a massive shootout. During a standoff among Quince, Earl, Trench, and Stigman, Earl reveals that the CIA has 20 other secret banks, and the loss of the $43 million is only a minor setback. Signaling Stigman with a phrase from an earlier conversation, Stigman shoots Earl, and Trench shoots Quince. Trench and Stigman kill Greco and the duo escapes, but not before Trench shoots Stigman in the leg as payback for shooting him in the desert. While planning to continue to take down the CIA's secret banks and sabotage their black ops operations, Trench reveals to Stigman that he did not blow up all the money and had some stashed away."

Soon after, the two-headed shark attacks the boat and breaks the radio antenna, preventing ship co-captain Laura from summoning help. The group notice a deserted atoll near-by, so Laura drives the Sea King closer, before Professor Babish takes the students, consisting of Kate, Paul, Laura, Liza, Cole, Lyndsey, Ethan, Jamie, Ryan, Kirsten, Alex, Kristen, Kirk, Haley, Jeff, Alison, and Dana, over to the atoll on a dinghy.\n\nAnne remains on the Sea King, along with Laura and the ship's crew, Han and Dikilla. Laura enters the water to repair the ship's hull, but is quickly ripped apart by the two-headed shark. Meanwhile, the group searches the atoll for scrap metal to help repair the boat, where Kate tells Kirsten she is afraid of the water. Kirk, Haley and Alison decide to go skinny dipping, only to be attacked and eaten by the two-headed shark. The rest of the group meet up and find two small speedboats before an apparent earthquake hits, causing Professor Babish to fall and badly cut his leg. Jeff and Mike take Professor Babish back to the Sea King on the dinghy and Anne tends to her husband while Jeff and Mike head back to the atoll, and discover Laura's severed hand in the water before being attacked by the two-headed shark. They attempt to swim back to the Sea King, but both are ultimately killed.\n\nKate and Paul manage to fix the two boats they found, while Cole finds a gasoline tank to fuel them. Cole then jumps in one of the boats with Ryan, Jamie and Alex and drives away, prompting Kate, Paul, and Dana to follow in the other. The two boats race each other, unaware of Professor Babish's and Anne's warnings of the two-headed shark. The two-headed shark attacks Cole's boat, causing Ryan to fall into the water, where he is devoured, notifying the other students of the shark. Paul realizes the shark will continue to chase Cole's boat as it has a bigger engine. Cole also realizes this and jumps off the boat, leaving Jamie and Alex to be eaten. Kate, Paul and Dana save Cole and arrive back at the atoll, followed by Professor Babish, Anne, Han, and Dikilla on the dinghy.\n\nThe group creates a plan. They hook up a generator to metal poles and place them in the water to distract the shark while Kate and Cole travel to the Sea King and repair the hull. The plan works until the two-headed shark attacks the poles, knocking Han and Dikilla into the water where they are eaten, before the two-headed shark swims to the Sea King. Kate fixes the Sea King, only for Cole to drive away without her, forcing her to swim back to the atoll. The two-headed shark attacks the Sea King, causing it to sink, resulting in Cole being devoured and the boat sending out a distress signal. As the group panic, anothe earthquake hits and the atoll begins to rapidly sink, causing the group to realize that the supposed earthquakes were actually the atoll collapsing in on itself from the underground. Kristen and Dana become separated from the group and are devoured, as are Professor Babish and Anne. A small tsunami hits and the atoll sinks, leaving the survivors with little land. They take shelter in the still standing chapel, but the shark breaks in and devours Lyndsey, Michelle, Liza, and Ethan.\n\nKate, Paul and Kirsten discover the gasoline tank and lure the shark towards it.

    "2.0": "Vaseegaran (Rajinikanth) (a scientist who created a sophisticated robot in his likeness with a desire to commission it into the Indian Army. He introduced the robot as Chitti) introduces Nila (Amy Jackson), a domestic and feminine humanoid robot created by Vaseegaran, whose name is a contraction of \"Nice, Intelligent, Lovely Assistant\".\n\nThis robot is meant to be a friend, helper, and caretaker. It can drive, perform forensic analysis, jump walls and disable electronic alarms. Vaseegaran introduces new humanoid robot who is his personal assistant, to a group of students. Shortly thereafter, a student's smartphone suddenly starts flying, exhibiting avian characteristics.\n\nBefore long, cell phones all over Chennai begin to fly away, leaving the city in chaos. At an emergency council meeting initiated by the government, Vaseegaran enunciates that it is beyond conventional science to fight what he considers a fifth force and proposes reinstating Chitti (an advanced \"andro-humanoid\" robot. It was designed with a speed capacity of 1 Terahertz (Hz) and a memory capacity of 1 Zettabyte.), which was dismantled in 2010.\n\nBut Dhinendra Bohra (Sudhanshu Pandey) (A scientist and the son of Dr. Bohra, who was once killed by Chitti. After his father's death, Dhina assumes the robot to be Vaseegaran's alter-ego and wishes to take revenge on him. He happens to be the first person to voice against the reinstatement of Chitti in the government meeting. Later, he also becomes jealous of Chitti's resurgence and, sneaking into the AIRD Institute, he frees Pakshi's aura from the containment circuit.), who lost his father to Chitti's anger, opposes, and the council decides to seek help from the military, thereby vetoing Vaseegaran's proposal.\n\nThe growing stream of cell phones leaves havoc in its path, killing a mobile phone wholesaler Jayanth Kumar (Ishari K. Ganesh), a transmission tower owner Manoj Lulla (Kaizaad Kotwal), and the state's telecommunications minister Vaira Moorthy (Kalabhavan Shajohn). In addition, the swarm of cell phones takes the shape of a giant eagle claw to uproot all cell phone towers in a 200 Kms radius around Chennai. To prevent further damage, S. Vijay Kumar (Adil Hussain), the Home Minister, unofficially gives Vaseegaran permission to rebuild Chitti. Chitti traces the mobile phones. Vaseegaran then learns from Chitti that the eagle bird (made by the cell phones) is powered by the aura of a human being, which exudes negative energy. The radiation from the antennae of such signal transmitters and auras of other living organisms are positively charged while those of the dead are negatively charged, allowing the parabolic transmitters to repel the bird. Had it entered the electromagnetic field produced by the transmitters, the radiation from the antennae would neutralize the bird, preventing it from reassembling. Vaseegaran replicates a smaller version of those transmitters to destroy the bird. During neutralization, Vaseegaran learns that the negative aura is from Pakshi Rajan (Akshay Kumar).\n\nPakshi Rajan used to be an ornithologist who owned the now abandoned house where birds would come and live with him. Gradually, high-frequency radiation from the newly set up cell towers starts killing the birds due to the rapid growth of mobile phone industries. Pakshi then visits Jayanth Kumar, Manoj Lulla, and the telecommunications minister in order to request them to stop their unjust and unlawful activities but it is in vain. He also organizes conferences and protests against the exorbitant use of cell phones but receives no support. Ultimately, all his birds die, and a distraught Pakshi Rajan hangs himself to death from a cell tower. His life energy, along with that of numerous dead birds, combine together to form an aura that manipulates mobile phones into any form through electromagnetic radiation.\n\nChitti reactivates the transmitters and neutralizes Pakshi, storing his energy in a containment circuit. Chitti is hailed as a hero and Vaseegaran receives an order for 500 units of Chitti from the Indian army. But jealous of Chitti's resurgence, Dhinendra sneaks into the AIRD Institute and frees Pakshi's aura from the containment circuit. The aura enters Vaseegaran, enabling Pakshi Rajan to possess his body and attack humans who still possess cell phones. Chitti hesitates to kill him, as it would mean killing Vaseegaran too. Taking advantage of this, Pakshi disassembles Chitti. Vaseegaran takes control of his body long enough to instruct Nila to activate protocol 2.0 for Chitti.\n\nNila takes Chitti back to the lab and rebuilds its body, replacing its microchip with the red chip created by Bohra, which results in Chitti's violent configuration, version 2.0, being in control. Nila constrains it from harming anyone but Pakshi Rajan. Chitti then creates more versions of its likeness. Meanwhile, Pakshi takes over a crowded football stadium and exposes Dhinendra to radiation from the nearby cell towers, incinerating and killing him. Chitti, along with its army of robots, arrives and confronts him, resulting in a battle between the two. However, Chitti battery drains, and it rushes to the nearest power station.\n\nDuring this time, micro-bots resembling Chitti, called Kutti version 3.0, arrive mounted on white pigeons and confront Pakshi Rajan, who cannot kill the spectators now as it would mean that the pigeons would also get killed. At one point Pakshi's aura leaves Vaseegaran's body. The micro-bots then lead his aura to the signal transmission site, where Pakshi Rajan is eliminated. Vaseegaran recovers in the hospital and tells Vijay Kumar, who comes to see him, that he feels Pakshi Rajan was a virtuous person who became a victim of the corrupt society. He also suggests that everyone should limit the use of phones and conserve the lives of birds as much as possible. Chitti, now restored to its original version, begins a relationship with Nila, to which Vaseegaran gives his consent.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Sana asks Vaseegaran over the phone about the probability of mobile phones flying again. Immediately, Vaseegaran's mobile flies out of his hand and morphs into Kutti 3.0, saying, \"I am your grandson\"."

    "2010: Moby Dick": "wikipedia:\n\nThe film begins in November 20, 1969, 50 miles off Soviet waters. When the USS Acushnet dives under the ice, a young Ahab (Jay Gillespie) listens for enemy subs when suddenly he detects an unknown target. When the captain listens, he hears nothing, but Ahab insists in the presence of an emptiness. The target dives into a trench, but the captain abandons his search in favor of photographing the target. The target attacks the submarine as Ahab hears a roar. The sub is brought to the icy surface, and the target identifies itself as a gigantic, white, whale-like creature. Ahab survives, but loses his leg to the beast when it hauls the other half of the sub back underwater.\n\nIn the present day, Dr. Michelle Herman (Ren\u00e9e O'Connor) and her assistant Pip (Derrick Scott) test a whale song generator when the USS Pequod surfaces behind them and Lieutenant Commander Starbuck (Adam Grimes), the executive officer, persuades them to come aboard. In the sub, Starbuck tells them about several attacks in which eyewitnesses all report seeing an enormous whale. Although Michelle explains that the whale song generator needs a recorded whale vocalization, Captain Ahab (Barry Bostwick) comes to the deck and gives her the recording he took of Moby Dick back in 1969. Although Michelle disagrees on joining a Navy sub with the intent of killing an animal, she has no choice.\n\nIn San Diego, Captain Boomer (Matt Lagan) (another survivor of the attack of '69) is told by his superiors of suspicious activity revolving around the Pequod. He is assigned to investigate, and thanks to a survivor from a recent attack by the White Whale, he comes to the conclusion that Ahab is on the hunt for Moby Dick.\n\nMeanwhile, the USS Essex is searching for the Pequod off Hawaii. When they go to active sonar, it attracts the attention of the wandering Moby Dick. The Essex engages at what appears to be the sub they were searching for, but realizes too late that their adversary is biological just before the sub is destroyed by a torpedo it shot. Later the Pequod comes to their location with no sign of the whale, but encounter the corpses of Essex crew. Rousing his crew with a speech, Ahab moves on to search for the beast.\n\nA helicopter in search of the Pequod encounters it while the sub is following a 600-foot target. As the helicopter engages them, the sub fires a nuke at the unknown target, but the confused helicopter crew tell them they shot a school of giant squid just before they are swallowed alive by Moby Dick.\n\nThe whale then attacks the S.S. Rachel, a cruise liner, when the Pequod intervenes with Michelle's whalesong generator. This, although, causes the whale to attack them, subsequently destroying a fin on the Pequod. The sub fires a harpoon made from the Acushnet's hull on top of Moby Dick's eye, which forces him to dive deeper, dragging the Pequod with it. As the water pressure begins to damage the hull, the line snaps and Starbuck forces the ship to surface.\n\nMoby Dick surfaces too, and the Pequod, along with the help of Boomer in a helicopter, forces the whale into an atoll. The sub gets trapped in shallow water, and three boats are sent out to face the whale with guns and Ahab's harpoon. Moby Dick destroys two of the boats and forces the survivors onto the island's shores. The whale attacks them again, resulting in the death of Queequeg (Michael Teh). Ahab takes the last boat and fires his harpoon at the whale's other eye. Moby Dick destroys the boat, killing Ahab. The remaining crew of the Pequod, including Starbuck, and Pip, follow Ahab's orders and fire nukes at the island. Moby Dick dodges the nukes and crushes the Pequod just as the island explodes. The film ends with the White Whale surviving to wreak havoc another day, and with Michelle swimming to the surface just as a rescue helicopter arrives. ---Wikipedia"

    "2012": "In 2009, an American geologist named Adrian Helmsley (Ryan Mcdonland) visits astrophysicist Dr. Satnam Tsurutani (Jimi Mistry) in India and learns that neutrinos from a massive solar flare are causing the temperature of the Earth's core to rapidly increase. Arriving at a party in Washington, D.C, Helmsley presents his info to White House Chief of Staff Carl Anheuser who takes him to meet the President.\n\nIn 2010, U.S. President Thomas Wilson and other international leaders begin a secret project to ensure humanity's survival. More than 400,000 people are chosen to board enormous \"arks\" constructed at Cho Ming, Tibet, in the southwest Chinese Himalayas. A Buddhist monk named Nima is evacuated while his brother Tenzin joins the Ark project. Additional funding is raised by selling tickets for EUR1 billion per person. By 2011, valuable items are moved to the arks with the help of art expert and First Daughter Dr. Laura Wilson (Thandie Newton).\n\nIn 2012, Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) is a science fiction writer in Los Angeles who works as a limousine driver for Russian billionaire Yuri Karpov (Zlatko Buric). Jackson's former wife Kate (Amanda Peet), and their children Noah and Lilly, live with Kate's boyfriend, plastic surgeon Gordon Silberman (Thomas McCarthy). Jackson takes Noah and Lilly camping in Yellowstone National Park. When they arrive at the park, they find the park fenced off by the military who arrived. They cross over the fence but are captured by the U.S. Army and taken in to see Helmsley, who recognizes Jackson after he published his recent book, Farewell Atlantis. After they are released from military custody, they meet Charlie Frost (Woody Harrelson), who hosts a radio show from the park (also the person who spotted them enter the restricted area).\n\nLater that night, after the military evacuates from Yellowstone, Jackson watches Charlie's video of Charles Hapgood's theory that polar shifts and the Mesoamerican Long Count Calendar predict that the 2012 phenomenon will occur. Charlie also tells Jackson that those who discovered this and plotted to inform the public were killed in various accidents. After an earthquake hits Los Angeles, the family returns home. Jackson grows suspicious and rents a Cessna 340 to rescue his family. He collects his family and Gordon as the Earth crust displacement begins with a magnitude 10.9 earthquake, and they narrowly escape Los Angeles as California collapses into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nAs millions of people die in earthquakes worldwide, the group flies to Yellowstone to retrieve a map from Charlie, escaping as the Yellowstone Caldera erupts. Charlie stays behind to broadcast the eruption and is killed. Learning that the arks are in China, the group lands in Las Vegas to find a larger plane. They find Yuri, his twin sons Alec and Oleg, girlfriend Tamara and pilot Sasha. Helmsley, Anheuser, and Laura Wilson are aboard Air Force One where they are heading to the arks. President Wilson remains in Washington, D.C. to address the nation one last time. With the Vice President dead and the Speaker of the House missing, Anheuser appoints himself Acting Commander in Chief even though he is not in the presidential line of succession. Back in Las Vegas, the group steals an Antonov An-500 aircraft, and they depart for China as the Yellowstone ash cloud engulfs the city. President Wilson is later killed by a mega tsunami that sends the aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy crashing into the White House.\n\nWhen the group arrive in China, the plane runs out of fuel and crashes in the mountains, killing Sasha, while the others make a narrow escape. They are then spotted by helicopters from the Chinese army. Yuri and his sons, possessing tickets, are taken to the arks, leaving the Curtis family and Gordon behind along with Tamara because Yuri knows she had an affair with Sasha. The remaining group are picked up by Nima and taken to the arks with his grandparents. They stow away on Ark 4, where the United States contingent is aboard, with the help of Tenzin. As a mega tsunami approaches the site, an impact driver becomes lodged in the gears of the ark's hydraulic doors, preventing a boarding gate from closing, which in turn prevents the ship from starting its engines. In the ensuing chaos, Yuri, Gordon and Tamara are killed, and Ark 4 is set adrift. Jackson and Noah dislodge the impact driver and the crew regains control of the ark before it collides with Mount Everest. Jackson rejoins with his family, and he and Kate reconcile.\n\nAs flood waters from the tsunamis slowly recede, the arks travel to the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, where the Drakensberg Mountain range has now emerged. Helmsley starts a relationship with Laura while Jackson and Kate rekindle their relationship."

    "21 Bridges": "A young Andre Davis (Chadwick Boseman) attends the funeral of his father, who was a police officer murdered during one of his shifts. Years later, Davis becomes a successful law enforcer working for the NYPD. Struggling with the legacy of his father, Davis has earned a reputation for hunting down and killing \"cop killers,\" although he claims they were all in self-defense and is uncomfortable with the label.\n\nOne night, two small-time criminals and former war veterans Michael Trujillo (Stephan James) and Ray Jackson (Taylor Kitsch) take a job to ransack a winery and steal several kilograms of cocaine it was keeping. The heist goes wrong when they realize there is more cocaine than they were expecting, and police officers casually arrive at the location. They are forced into a shootout where Ray guns down the officers. Michael chastises Ray for putting them in jeopardy due to the officers' deaths. They run a red light in their escape (which leads to a pic being taken).\n\nDavis is assigned to the case. Narcotics detective Frankie Burns (Sienna Miller) is assigned as Davis' partner. Davis and Burns come into conflict with FBI agents Butchco (Obi Abili) and Dugan (Andy Truschinski), who attempt to take over the case (arguing that the perpetrators have left New York by now). But Andre argues that the perpetrators were only 2 and were confronted with 300 Kgs of cocaine and they only stole 30 Kgs. They clearly were not expecting 300 Kgs, so either it was dumb luck, or it was a set-up. And given they were not expecting it, their handler is in NY and hence they haven't left state yet. With the reluctant approval of the deputy mayor, the FBI, and the officers' precinct head, Captain McKenna (J. K. Simmons), Davis asks for Manhattan to be locked down, although they are given until only 5:00 a.m. to catch the criminals.\n\nNow on the run, Ray and Michael coerce their liaison, Bush (Louis Cancelmi), to persuade their handler to give them a bigger cut in exchange for their identities changed for their escape. They are given more money and their fixer, Adi (Alexander Siddig), gives them new identities and tells them to depart for Miami the next morning. Davis and Burns manage to identify Ray, Michael, and Bush (when Andre tracks down the owner of the car through its pic, which was Bush's ex-girlfriend) in the resulting investigation. Bush is gunned down by Butchco and Dugan when they get there first. After catching Butchco planting his sidearm on Bush's body and briefly scuffling with him, Davis feels more suspicious when a police force led by Lieutenant Kelly (Darren Lipari) quickly manages to locate Adi's apartment. Adi is mortally wounded by the policemen but manages to give Michael two flash drives before Michael and Ray escape.\n\nDavis and Burns manage to catch up to Michael and Ray; after accidentally killing a civilian, Ray is mortally wounded by Davis. Michael then holds Burns at gunpoint and tells Davis about the drives and how suspicious everything is before escaping. Burns chastises Davis for letting Michael escape despite Davis' supposed reputation for killing those who murder cops. Michael manages to hide in a hotel room, where he unlocks the contents of the drive and realizes that McKenna's precinct was involved in trafficking the drugs from the winery and earning profits for it. After another chase where Michael abandons his money, Davis manages to corner him in a subway train and convinces him to surrender, promising to keep him alive. Michael is suddenly shot by Burns, who had also boarded the train and claimed that she thought Michael was still holding Davis at gunpoint. Davis berates her for shooting Michael, who secretly hands over the drives alongside the password to them to Davis before dying. As the police congratulate the two for their efforts, Davis realizes that Burns had contacted Kelly before Adi's apartment was raided.\n\nThe next morning, McKenna arrives at his home to find Davis holding him at gunpoint, having found out the contents in the drives. McKenna reasons that the officers were struggling to survive on a measly pay, which forced them to go into drug trafficking, but that fails to convince Davis to walk away. McKenna, a hiding Butchco, Dugan, and Kelly - who were all on McKenna's payroll - then open fire on Davis. Davis kills all of them, including McKenna, who refuses to surrender. Burns, whom Davis deduced was also allied with McKenna, appears from behind and holds Davis at gunpoint. Davis convinces her to give up after revealing that he had already leaked the information online, and that he doesn't want her daughter to live without her mother should she get a life sentence for killing him. In the aftermath, Davis solemnly drives off on one of New York's bridges in the sunset, with the drives beside him snapped."

Elvis (Shaun Benson), the rival driver, offers the truck driver in the accident to blame the cyclist for the accident. Elvis claims the cyclist is in bad shape. Ben tells the truck driver to use Sean (Aaron Ashmore), a tow truck driver from Jackrabbit towing, who Ben believes will give him an honest deal. Later, Ben stops at dispatch and turns in just one slip because he was detained by police for his 911 call on the accident. Ben and Avery Dankert (Tiio Horn) used what little money they had, Ben's inheritance, to move to Toronto to get away from a toxic family environment. Working as a tow truck driver, specifically in bylaw (towing illegally parked cars) for Jackrabbit Towing Services, and a cook in a diner respectively, they are unable to make ends meets let alone provide the little extras for their son Zach (Jack Fulton), who is continually taunted by classmates as white trash and gets into fights. Ben promises Zach a $300 bicycle for his birthday is he can curtail the violence and be a man of character like Ben's father. Ben and Avery's jobs are meant as a means to an end. Ben wants to open his own garage, and Avery who wants to go to culinary school and open her own restaurant. While she knows how to cook, Avery is unable to get any better job without culinary training, schooling which they can't afford. On the street, Ben runs into Indian named Wayne (Raoul Trujillo) who is a \"chaser\" at an intersection. Wayne describes how much money he makes taking an accident to a dealership outside the city. Wayne claims he is so busy he needs two trucks. Ben visits wife Avery at the restaurant. She complains about the cost of Zach's bike and a lack of money to even buy food. Ben returns to the dispatch office. Ben's unscrupulous boss, Bissey,(John Kapelos) institutes a new policy on the brink of Jackrabbit imminently being awarded the lucrative police contract: all drivers must lease the trucks from him, first and last month's payment due immediately. Bissey is now making drivers lease their trucks from the company or they will be terminated. Feeling like the police contract is what will get them out of their financial bind, Ben, on the recommendation of his best friend from high school Sean who also works as a tow truck driver for Jackrabbit, gets the money from a loan shark, Ray (Aidan Devine), who works in his day job as a police constable. Ray loans Ben $5000 but Ben must repay $750 per week until $6000 is paid. When Ben returns to his job, a woman drives her vehicle off the tow and flies Ben the finger The following week, Ben is late on his first payment to Ray. Ray begins to charge him additional interest. Sean shows Zach the emergency scanners in his truck. Zach calls the chasers pigs because he has been taught the chaser are unscrupulous. Sean offers to help Avery out. He seems to have an interest in Avery and a desire to belittle high school hockey star Ben. When Ben gets his paycheck for the week, he is behind on his truck, so the company has deducted his payment due for his truck lease from his paycheck. The financial windfall from the police contract does not materialize quickly. Ray stops by Avery's diner and tells her to call her husband. Ray demands that Avery tell her husband that Ray really wants his money. Zach goes another week without fighting and is well on his way to earning the promise bicycle. Ben asks his boss for an advance and is soundingly rejected. Ray meets Ben outside the office and slams Ben's wrist in the truck door breaking his wrist. Arriving home, Ben finds Sean there eating potato soup. Ben agrees to loan the couple the money and makes advances on Avery. Ben, in a cast, tells Avery if she takes a dime from Sean, they are done as a couple. Ben, who generally operates on morals, decides to try to break-into the cutthroat but more lucrative world of the chasers - tow truck drivers who monitor the police frequency for accident scenes. Chasers generally have no morals. Ray heists Sean's scanners from his rig and joins the chasers for the night of work. He alerts Wayne he is working on his turf short term. Elvis pulls up shortly after. An emergency call sends all three drivers into a high-speed chase. Ben stops to help a homeless woman who crossed the street in from of him and is beaten to the accident site. One job Ben is able to find is to haul a car containing a transvestite prostitute and his client who has a kink earning $100. Elvis brags to Wayne his new tires on his rig are like a sexual experience. Ray picks up son from the sitters and learns Zach invited Kamal who bullies him to his birthday party the next day in order to be friends. Ben is proud. Avery is angry when Ben picks her up at the diner. She states that Ben is acting crazy trying to keep his promise to his kid. Another emergency call has Ben, Wayne and Elvis again racing to the accident site. Ray's first instinct is to help the accident victim that was on the street. Then realize he needs to sell his service which he does with kindness and integrity which costs Elvis a fare. When Ben gets the car to Kaleb's (Wole Daramola) body shop, Kaleb doesn't pay Ben the kickback he expects. Kaleb suggests taking the woman who owns the car to a physio clinic who also pays points to tow truck drivers. Elvis arrives and beats Ben and takes his $200 plus $20 for his time and gas as Wayne watches. Ben meets with Ray to negotiate for more time. He witnesses Ray severely injure a man who wasn't good for the money he borrowed. Ben comes to realize that not only his own life, but that of Avery and Zach are at risk. Avery meets Sean in his car. Sean has picked up some party supplies and gives Avery money to get Ray off his back. Sean makes moves on Avery that she initially fights off. Sean persists by bringing up the money he will loan her and not request repayment. Ben is at home when Avery arrives and tells her they need to jump on a bus and head out west. Avery says she will not comply. When Ben asks if she will stay for Sean, she admits she could have solved their problems by sleeping with Sean but she could not. Avery suggests she could go home with Zach to her mother's house but Ben would not be welcome. Zach overhears and is troubled. Then sees his father has been in a fight and calls Ben a liar. Now highly motivated, Ben drives some nails in a table leg and hits the road. He travels to where Wayne and Elvis are parked. With the spikes, he punctures Elvis's tires on his rig and sprays an aerosol in Elvis's eyes when Elvis approaches to get revenge. An accident report is broadcast over the scanner and Ben races Wayne to the site. Ben gets the lead in the race when Wayne's truck is suddenly t-boned by a taxi cab. One of the cab passengers runs away. In his truck cab, Wayne is near death. Ben dials 911 on his phone, leaves it on the dashboard, but then takes off to the other accident site. He takes a high prices sports car to Kaleb who pays him a large kickback on repairs. Leaving the body shop, Ben calls Binnie's wife, Rhonda (Sonya C\u00f4t\u00e9). She agrees to sign off on his truck title and he takes her to a place where Binnie is having an affair. Ben meets Ray at dawn and pays off his loan. Ray tells Ben that the passenger of the taxi saw a Jackrabbit truck at the accident. Ben offers Ray a chance to be his partner in a shop and a restaurant. Ben then enters Binnie's office. Binnie tells Ray that he ruined his family and he should get off his lot. Ray says he is staying on with the company as his chaser in his own truck. Outside Ray is roughing up Sean. Ray picks up the bike Zach wants and brings it to Zach's birthday party. Ben sits down by Avery and tells her he paid for the bike. When she asks how, another accident call echoes on the tow trucks scanner."

    "22 Jump Street": "Following their success in the 21 Jump Street program, Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are back on the streets chasing narcotics. However, after failing in the pursuit of a group of drug dealers led by Ghost (Peter Stormare), Deputy Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) puts the duo back on the program to work for Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) - now located across the street at 22 Jump Street. Their assignment is to go undercover as college students and locate the supplier of a drug known as \"WHYPHY\" (WiFi) that killed a student photographed buying it on campus.\n\nAt college, Jenko quickly makes friends with a pair of jocks named Zook (Wyatt Russell) and Rooster (Jimmy Tatro), the latter being a prime suspect of the investigation. Jenko starts attending parties with the jocks who do not take as kindly to Schmidt. Meanwhile, Schmidt gets the attention of an art student, Maya (Amber Stevens), by feigning an interest in slam poetry. The two sleep together, to the disapproval of Maya's roommate Mercedes (Jillian Bell), and it is revealed that Maya is the daughter of the vehemently disapproving Captain Dickson. Despite sleeping together, Maya tells Schmidt not to take it seriously, and he starts to feel left out as Jenko bonds more and more with Zook who encourages him to join the football team.\n\nSchmidt and Jenko visit Mr. Walters (Rob Riggle) and Eric (Dave Franco) in jail for advice on how to look for the WHYPHY supplier. Walters notices a unique tattoo on the arm of the dealer in the photograph and insists that if they find the tattoo, they will have found their man. Whilst hanging out with Zook and Rooster, Jenko notices that Rooster does not have the tattoo but sees it on Zook's arm. Schmidt and Jenko are invited to join the fraternity led by the jocks but Schmidt refuses, furthering the tension between the two. At a counselling session, they realise that perhaps Zook was buying the drugs rather than selling them, and soon after find Ghost and his men on campus. A chase ensues and Ghost again evades the pair. Jenko reveals to Schmidt that he's been offered a football scholarship with Zook and is unsure whether or not he wants to continue to be a police officer. Schmidt decides for him by telling officers on the scene that Jenko had nothing to do with the melee caused by the chase. Immediately afterwards, Schmidt moves out of the dorm and Maya finds out who he really is.\n\nSpring Break arrives and Schmidt prepares to go after Ghost alone. Jenko asks to help so that the two can have one final mission together, and the pair head to the beach where Ghost is likely to be dealing WHYPHY. Inside a bar, they find Mercedes, revealed to be Ghost's daughter, giving instructions to other dealers. The pair, backed up by Dickson, ambush the meeting and give chase as they flee. Mercedes is able to handcuff Dickson and take him hostage, pursued by Schmidt. Meanwhile, Jenko goes after Ghost. After a fist fight with Mercedes, Schmidt is held at gunpoint by her but Maya sneaks up and knocks her out. Schmidt goes to help Jenko who is now on the roof of the college in pursuit of Ghost, who shoots Jenko in the shoulder. Ghost attempts to escape in a helicopter and Jenko jumps across to it but struggles to hold on with his injured arm. Schmidt makes the same jump and the two fall into the sea, but not before Jenko is able to throw a grenade into the helicopter, killing Ghost.\n\nBack on land, Jenko tells Schmidt that he still wants to be a police officer as he believes their differences help their partnership, and the two reconcile in front of a cheering crowd. Dickson approaches them claiming to have a new mission undercover at a med school. During the credits, a series of mock sequels and vignettes are shown depicting the two going undercover in various places."

    "24 Hours to Live": "In South Africa, a convoy of Interpol agents led by Lin (Xu Qing) transport a prisoner, Keith. At a checkpoint, they are ambushed. Most of the agents are killed, but Lin escapes with Keith.\n\nTravis Conrad (Ethan Hawke), a hitman, fishes with his father in law, Frank (Rutger Hauer). They scatter ashes in the ocean, noting the one year anniversary of the deaths they commemorate. After Frank falls asleep, Travis goes to a bar to get cocaine. He assaults two thugs following him who tell him Jim wants to see him. Jim offers Travis $1 million per day to clean up the botched assassination attempt on Keith and Lin. Though he initially refuses, claiming he's retired, the money convinces him. He travels to Hong Kong and meets Lin's son, from whom he steals his cell phone and determines Lin's location. He meets her at the airport and seduces her. The next morning, he gets Keith's location from her phone but chooses not to kill her; she realizes he is an agent and kills him.\n\nTravis' agency, Red Mountain, bring him back to life using an experimental procedure. Once he tells them Keith's location, Jim, his friend and former fellow Marine, informs him that they just revived him to get the location, and the doctor plans to kill him upon her return. Travis obtains a scalpel and cuts his restraints; when the doctor returns he kills a guard and learns from her that he has 24 hours to live. He escapes with her as a hostage and pursues Lin, telling her not to make him regret not killing her.\n\nKeith testifies against Red Mountain, revealing they experimented on over 70 civilians to develop the resurrection procedure and forced him to dispose of the bodies. Just after he testifies, Jim snipes several guards from a clocktower and Red Mountain assault the building. Lin and Keith escape when Travis arrives to help, knowing Red Mountain betrayed him. During the chase, Keith is killed, but he managed to get the camera's memory card before they left. Travis entrusts the card to Lin, but Jim calls to inform them that they have taken her son in exchange for the card. Travis decides to help her retrieve him and collects guns and explosives from a safe house.\n\nThey travel to the village from which the civilians Red Mountain experimented on lived and enlist their help in avenging them. Travis knows prisoner transport protocol; they corner and ambush the convoy and get the boy back. Travis tells Lin to get the testimony to the authorities and decides to spend his last half hour alive delaying Red Mountain from pursuing her. He forces a surviving Red Mountain agent to drive him to base claiming he is the prisoner; when he arrives he kills several guards and drives the car into the building. He detonates the car and assaults the office in which Jim and the Red Mountain leader, Wetzler, are holed up. After killing all the agents in the room, Wetzler tries to goad Travis into killing Jim, who knew that Wetzler ordered his wife and son killed in an attempt to keep him from quitting the company. Though angered, Travis feels remorse for all the killing he's done and lets Jim live. Jim then approaches Wetzler to kill him as police arrive. Though they warn him not to shoot, he shoots Wetzler and is killed himself.\n\nTravis dies and has a vision of his family on a beach. He beckons for his son, but he runs away. Travis begins to hear a woman's voice and awakes in the lab in which he was first resurrected."

    "24: Redemption": "Sangala, Africa (Don't feel bad if you don't know where it is, it's fictional.)\n\nMen drive through the streets of a shantytown with machine guns and young boys in the back of a truck. A man reports to his colonel that he has five boy soldiers. At the training camp, boys no older than 14 practice shooting with automatic weapons. They swig from presumably laced bottles, woozy and pliant. Colonel Dubaku gives the boys a pep talk about exterminating cockroaches (i.e. dissenters) and puts a machete in a stoned boy's hands. He whacks at the \"cockroach\" as the crowd of children cheers.\n\nThe 24 clock ticks.\n\n\"The following takes place between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. Events occur in real time.\"\n\nA stuffed shirt carrying a federal subpoena rides in a car.\n\nTwo young brothers argue as one wants to go into town. The younger says Mr. Benton says they're not supposed to. The older one goes with a friend anyway.\n\nA U.N. truck arrives at the boys school. As the boys follow it the first boy sneaks into someone's room and starts going through someone's things. He finds a scarf he likes.\n\nJack Bauer arrives in the doorway. The scarf is from India, Jack was going to give it to his daughter some day. He got it there last summer. He tells Willie he can keep the scarf, but Jack's gonna need his knife back.\n\nCarl Benton comes to talk to Jack with the stuffed shirt, Frank Trammell, the ambassador's chief political officer. Jack knows who he is, he got his messages. Frank tells him the senate subcommittee has questions about the torture and questioning of prisoners in Jack's custody and tries to serve him. Jack says if they want him, they can come get him. Trammell tells Benton that Jack's been ducking the subpoena for more than a year across three continents. Frank tells Benton it'd be a shame for his funding for the boys school to dry up because of Jack.\n\nJack unloads stuff from the supply truck as a Frenchman generally irritates him.\n\n3:10 The rebels have more guns than soldiers to carry them. An underling promises Dubaku he'll have his \"little soldiers.\" Dubaku gets a satellite phone call from Jonas Hodges, your standard issue \"24\" bad guy in a suit, offering more soldiers if he needs them. Hodges provided the weapons. He wants General Juma to call him later. Hodges, back in D.C., tells a businessman he doesn't want the transactions traceable by anyone and to deal with it. On the trading floor a broker named Chris tries to smooth talk a client. He reaches in his drawer for a pill and pops it. Chris is summoned by his boss and passes Hodges on his way into the office. His boss tells him to burn some records.\n\nBenton talks to Jack, telling him he should look at the subpoena. Jack tells Benton not to worry, he'll be gone by dark. He tells Benton all he has left is his freedom, and he won't let them take that away from him. We learn Jack called him after 10 years, they're old special ops buddies, and Benton has found a way to live with himself, but first he had to stop running. Benton tells him again Jack's welcome to stay. But Jack says they both know it'd be better if he left.\n\nThe Frenchman with the supply truck argues with a man saying that nothing is wrong and that Juma isn't stealing children. Willie mentions that his brother Desmond is in town with James. Benton says he'll go into town to find them. The Frenchman mocks Benton for being worried and says they would have heard if Juma was up to something.\n\nThe boys play soccer in town. The men with machine guns drive up, firing into the air. The boys run but they're surrounded. They're told they're now soldiers in the People's Freedom Army and they'll have the honor of fighting the imperialists to take back their land. One boy wets himself and they laugh at him. As they're distracted James and Desmond make a break for it. The men take off after them into nearby woods. One of the men fires at them, hitting them. The boys fall and lie still as the man chastises the one who fired, saying they're no good to them dead. But they drive off.\n\n3:26 A man and a woman get ready for something in the morning. The man, Roger, gets a call from Chris, saying he thinks he might be in trouble. Roger assumes Chris has been drinking. Chris wants to meet up. He knows it's terrible timing, but he says it's really important. His girlfriend isn't happy Roger's making time for Chris, and tells him not to be late for his mother's inauguration.\n\nAt the White House, Allison Taylor awaits her inauguration. Tom Lennox finds her in the hall and says President Daniels is dealing with an urgent matter. She says he might as well tell her what it is, since it'll be her problem in a matter of hours. There's an impending coup in Sangala. On a conference call, President Daniels talks to Sangala's prime minister. Lennox tells him Taylor wants to weigh in. Daniels greets her, pointedly calling her \"Senator\" Taylor. She wants to know how Juma could raise an army without them knowing about it. She thinks they need a show of force, but Daniels thinks it isn't their fight. He ordered the ambassador to begin evacuating all non-military U.S. nationals. She thinks that sends the wrong message.\n\n3:33 Benton finds the deflated soccer ball. He sees a buzzard picking at something in the trees. It's one of the boys. Ew. He calls for Desmond and sees him slumped by a stream. He's alive.\n\nAt the school, Willie tries to convince Jack to take him and Desmond with him. Willie says there are too many ghosts around, but Jack asks him to stay and help take care of the other boys.\n\nJack walks away.\n\n3:37\n\nThomas runs after him. Benton's on the phone. He tells him about the boys and Juma. They rebels are coming to the school, he wants Jack to hold them off until he gets back. Benton hasn't been able to get through to the embassy for military support.\n\nJack time! He yells at the boys to get in the shelter The Frenchman still doesn't believe anything is wrong and says the U.N. remains neutral. \"Why don't you go hide in the shelter with the other children?\" Jack snarls. Take that, surrender monkey. Jack finds Benton's guns and dynamite as the boys hide under a school room. Trucks of men with automatic weapons drive up. Jack starts lobbing dynamite and distracts them. He takes out a few then runs for cover. It's at least a dozen to one, just how Jack likes it. They have serious hardware, including a bazooka. A man creeps around the corner of a building right into Jack's knife. He takes his automatic weapon. The boys keep quiet, hiding. Jack gets two rebels to follow him into the nearby woods and it's hand to hand combat time. Jack's doing pretty well until a third guy shows up and whacks him with a gun butt. But the man in charge says to hold off on killing him until he tells them where the children are. Benton drives nearby with a wounded Desmond in the vehicle.\n\nHe checks out the scene and finds the rebels stringing Jack up.\n\n3:49\n\nA helicopter takes off from the embassy as people try to gain entry. But Trammell's only letting in U.S citizens. A woman with a baby pleads with him, but even when she offers to do anything he wants, he coldly says he can't. Carl Benton calls for him, telling him he needs help. But Trammell can't spare any Marines because they're helping with the evacuation. Trammell says if Benton wants to get the 14 boys out, they have to get to him at the embassy. The last chopper leaves in an hour.\n\nThe rebels beat on Jack, who, of course, isn't talking. The head guy removes a machete from the fire and singes Jack's ear. The children hear him scream.\n\nJack looks up to see Benton flashing a mirror at him in the distance. The next time the man threatens him, Jack begs, un-Jack-like, to spare him and says he'll show him where the kids are. He describes an underground shelter right where Benton is waiting. Jack faux-sobs. Two men investigate and Benton takes care of them. Jack grabs his torturer by the neck using his legs, and snaps it, killing him. Benton comes to untie him. He has sponsorship papers for the kids and needs to get them to the embassy, Benton tells him. They get the kids and load them onto the bus. The Frenchman U.N. guy refuses to provide an escort and goes off on his own.\n\nJack has one of the rebel's walkie talkies. He says he's going with Carl, who assures Jack that he won't have to go anywhere near the embassy.\n\n4:00 The secret service searches Chris at Roger's house. A couple months ago his boss, Nickles, called Chris into his office and wanted him to manage a special project, for which he got paid a ton. But he had to keep his mouth shut. He thought he was \"only\" helping his boss embezzle money from his own firm. But he recognized one of the account prefixes. The account holder was on the terrorist watch list. He tells Roger about the creepy guy that morning. Roger tells him he should go to the FBI, but Chris wants to take it to Roger's mom. Chris says he saved some records Nickles told him to destroy. They're on his hard drive at home. Roger says he's not doing anything until he sees the records from himself. Chris tells him to check his e-mail in an hour.\n\nGeneral Juma arrives at the base camp. They have Howitzers positioned to hit any target in the city.\n\nDubaku gets a call from someone. They've caught the Frenchman, who says that Dubaku's brother is dead and he has info on where the boys are. Listening to the walkie, Benton hears that the rebels are right in front of them on the road. He turns off the road and the patrol drives by. Desmond is developing a fever.\n\n4:12 Daniels hands over protocols to Taylor. She's ready to go, but Daniels offers her a drink. She declines but he has one anyway. He toasts her administration and when she says simply \"thank you,\" he corrects her, \"thank you, Mr. President.\" In the hallway, she complains to her husband that Daniels ordered an evacuation without consulting her. She thinks there might be a reason he made the order that he's hiding.\n\nDubaku wants revenge for his brother's death, but Juma wants him to focus on the coup. Dubaku says he just needs an hour.\n\n4:22 Chris arrives home. He starts to copy the data from his computer. He contemplates popping a pill but thinks better of it. He hears a noise in his apartment and goes to investigate. When he returns to his computer, he finds a man there. There's a gun on the desk now. The man asks if the files are everything. He's there to recover them. Another man comes up behind him and whacks him with a newspaper. The first man says Chris is going to tell them everything he knows and they'll know if he's lying. Duct tape is involved.\n\nIn the car, Roger's girlfriend harasses him to tell her what Chris's visit was all about. But he says he gave his word to keep it private. Edward, the driver and secret service agent who frisked Chris, announces they've arrived.\n\nEdwards gets a call. The man in Chris apartment tells him they managed to recover the files but they're working to determine their exposure now. The second man injects Chris with something.\n\n4:31 Jack, Benton and the boys cross a field and Benton tells Jack to follow the river to get out of there while they follow a safe road into town. They say good-bye and Jack walks off, again. Just then there's a noise in the distance. They're standing in an open field, exposed, when a helicopter comes around the corner. They run for the trees as the helicopter, with Dubaku inside, fires on them. He orders the pilot to land. The kids hurry through the woods. Willie stops, realizing he dropped the scarf Jack gave him. He runs to get it from the brush where it fell. Benton watches Willie and sees his foot step between two land mines. Benton rushes to keep him from triggering one, pushing him aside. In the process, Benton ends up standing directly on top of it, arming it. Jack inspects it, but Benton knows the make and model. It can't be disabled. Benton tells Jack there isn't enough time. He asks Jack to take the kids to the embassy. He gives Jack their sponsorship papers. He says he'll try to buy them some time. Benton tells the kids to go with Jack, nobly saying he'll be right behind them. Jack and Benton exchange knowing man nods.\n\n4:38 Dubaku and his men look for the children in the woods. Benton covers up the land mine and raises his rifle over his head. The four or five men and Dubaku approach him, guns drawn. When Benton won't tell Dubaku where Jack is, Dubaku shoots him in the arm. Then the other arm. Benton struggles to stay balanced on the land mine. He mutters where they are and Dubaku steps closer to hear. Benton looks at Dubaku and tells him to go to hell.\n\nJack hears a large blast in the distance and pauses for a minute, having lost another friend.\n\n4:46 In the city, Jack and Thomas guide the kids to the embassy. Jack tells Thomas he's going to give him the papers. When Willie figures out that Benton is dead he runs off, crying. Jack runs after him, telling him Mr. Benton died to make sure he'd be safe. He tells him he's sorry as he gives him a hug. They hurry, rushing to make the chopper. Jack notices something amiss in the street and tells Thomas to hide with the boys behind a truck. He homes in on a man walking suspiciously through the crowd, as the man opens his coat to reveal a weapon, Jack shoots him dead. Men begin firing from the rooftops and a street full of people hit the deck. The coup is on.\n\nJack turns to find the young drugged boy who killed the \"cockroach\" in the opening aiming an automatic weapon at him. Jack tries to talk to him, telling him he can come with them out of the country if he puts his gun down. He promises no one will hurt him. The boy throws down his gun and runs away. Benton's boys hold hands, then weave through the crowd.\n\nAt the inauguration, Roger checks his phone, looking for the files from Chris. His mother arrives. As Taylor greets her son, Edward and Hodges confer off to the side. Edwards tells Hodges they don't need to worry about Roger, that he has no evidence and he'll think his strung-out friend told him something crazy. Hodges tells Edward to keep an eye on Roger.\n\n4:52 Chaos reigns at the embassy as desperate citizens try to find sanctuary. Jack pushes his way to the front of the crowd, telling the guard that Trammell is expecting him. The boys wait in the crush of people, Desmond fading fast. Trammell arrives and Jack, through the gate, tells him Benton is dead, but he has their paperwork. Trammell tells him there's a problem: they need the legal guardianship of a U.S. citizen. If Jack surrenders himself, Trammell will waive the requirement. Trammell says whatever happens to them will be on Jack. \"I don't have a choice you son of a bitch, open the gate,\" Jack growls. . Trammell makes Jack go in first, keeping the boys on the other side. Once through, Jack is immediately handcuffed while the guard blocks the boys at the gate. As Jack screams for the boys to be let in, Trammell finally relents. They boys are safe inside as Jack is led away by guards.\n\nAllison Taylor takes the oath of office Hundreds of desperate people are left on the other side of the embassy gates. Taylor gives her speech over scenes of boys testing automatic weapons in Sangala, the two goons covering Chris's body in concrete and Jack being flown away on the helicopter. Taylor speaks of apathy, greed and fear threatening freedom.\n\nThe helicopter takes off at the embassy as the screaming citizens are finally let inside, only to see the last form of transport depart. Willie reassuringly puts his hand on Jack's shoulder.\n\n5:00\n\nScenes from Season 7: Jack testifies at the senate subcommittee, being grilled about torture and saying he doesn't regret his decisions. Taylor making an impassioned plea to stop Juma; a woman briefing Jack that the man behind the threat is someone he knows: Tony Almeida, who is not dead. Then explosions, gun fights, car chases, threats to air traffic control, Chloe saying she's a stay at home mom. Dubaku, apparently not dead, threatening the president. Taylor refusing to bow to threats from Dubaku, a leak at the FBI. Finally, Jack grabbing Tony by the throat: \"So help me god, I will kill you and you will stay dead this time.\""

    "3 Days to Kill": "The film opens at the CIA Headquarters in Langley, VA. Agent Vivi DeLay (Amber Heard) meets with the CIA director and another man to discuss their target, Wolfgang Braun, aka \"The Wolf\" (Richard Sammel). The man is attempting to sell arms to terrorists along with his associate, The Albino (Tomas Lemarquis). The men assign Vivi to take both of them down. She asks them which agent they have on the ground. His name is Ethan Renner.\n\nWe meet Ethan (Kevin Costner) in a hotel in Paris where he and another agent, Yasmin (Mai Anh Le), are set to take down The Albino, set to make a deal with Serbians. Ethan has already killed the buyers, and he makes a quick and swift exchange with The Albino as he swaps briefcases containing secret codes. He goes to hand them over to other agents in a van, when his phone rings to remind him it's his daughter Zooey's (Hailee Steinfeld) birthday. He runs to make a call on a payphone and uses his watch as collateral with a nearby vendor to get change. He calls Zooey but gets her voice mail. In the hotel, Yasmin's identity is compromised when The Albino recognizes her. He drags her to an elevator and waits til it comes down so it decapitates her. His cohorts shoot at the agents in the van, leading to a gunfight from the lobby to outside the hotel. Ethan runs after The Albino and kills his men before chasing the villain. Ethan starts getting weak and groggy until he catches up to The Albino. He falls to the ground before shooting The Albino in the foot. He limps away as Ethan loses consciousness.\n\nEthan wakes up in the hospital to a doctor who tells him that he has cancer and it's spread to his lungs. He gives Ethan about 3-5 months to live.\n\nEthan returns to his apartment to find that there's a family living there. The patriarch, Jules (Eriq Ebouaney), warmly welcomes Ethan back, telling him they are refugees seeking a new place to live. He goes to complain about it, but is told that if he forces the family out, he can get arrested. Ethan goes back and takes out his gun in front of Jules, but then relents and says he can stay until his eldest daughter gives birth to her child.\n\nEthan calls his ex-wife Tina (Connie Nielsen) as she's meeting up with friends. She is hesitant to meet with him until he says it's urgent that they get together. They go together to sign his will and he tells her that he is dying and he doesn't want Zooey to know. He wants to meet up with her, and Tina tells him only on the condition that he is officially done working for \"them\". Ethan says yes.\n\nThe two of them go meet Zooey at her school. Her reunion with her father is awkward and she seems less than interested in talking to him. A handsome older boy comes over to Zooey, and she introduces him as Hugh (Jonas Bloquet). He is polite to Ethan when she introduces them, though he is understandably on the fence about it. Hugh leaves and Ethan presents Zooey with a purple bike, thinking that is still her favorite color. She opts to take the metro with her friends, leaving Ethan to ride the bike himself.\n\nEthan stops at a stand and is met by Vivi. She drops Zooey's name and shows him his watch that he left by the hotel. She gets him to ride with her, telling him to work for her. He refuses until she says she has an experimental drug that can save his life. Ethan reconsiders, and Vivi tells him the job is to find The Wolf and kill him.\n\nVivi takes Ethan to a hotel to find a man that can give them the whereabouts of The Albino's accountant. She tells Ethan there's only one guy in there, but after he busts into the room of their target, he finds five guys. He and Vivi end up killing all of them when nobody gives them any info. In the elevator, Ethan tells her he will only continue the assignment if he is given 50 grand and a $1 million life insurance policy. She complies and gives him a shot of the drug.\n\nWe see The Albino meeting up with a man. He gives this man a photo of Ethan to keep on him.\n\nEthan goes to Zooey and Tina's apartment and hears Zooey scream. Thinking she's in danger, he breaks the doorknob and busts in, only to find that she is upset over a bad hairdo. Tina is mad at Ethan since he earlier promised to cook dinner, yet he is th ree hours late. She is heading to London the next day on business and decides to call a sitter to look after Zooey, but Ethan insists that she let him take care of her.\n\nLater, Ethan starts to feel dizzy and he faints. He calls Vivi and tells her he's hallucinating. She tells him to drink vodka to ease himself. He does just that.\n\nTina leaves the next day, and Zooey comes in wearing a wig with a shade of red. She sees Vivi calling Ethan's phone, so he tells her it's his boss. She puts \"I Don't Care\" by Icona Pop as Ethan's ringtone for whenever she calls. Ethan once again tries to get Zooey to ride the bike to school, but she walks and drops the wig.\n\nEthan meets with Vivi again. She gives him the check she promised him and reminds him to keep his heart rate low. She has Ethan go look for a car salesman named Mitat Yilmaz (Marc Andreoni). Ethan goes to the dealership, insults Mitat's employees and knocks them out, then waits in Mitat's office until he returns. Ethan threatens Mitat's family and takes him back to the apartment, until he gets a call from Zooey's school, urging him to go speak to the principal. He takes Mitat with him and stuffs him in the trunk.\n\nEthan and Zooey meet with the principal. He learns that Zooey hit another classmate. He asks, \"Open palm or clenched fist?\" As they leave, Zooey tells Ethan it was because the girl she hit was teasing a girl from Pakistan. Ethan says he's not mad and tells her it's an effective way to get rid of a bully. Mitat starts making a fuss in the trunk, forcing Ethan to go punch him and tell him to shut up. Zooey leaves him, agitated by his behavior and his constant coughing. However, she later calls him back to apologize and asks him to meet her at her favorite spot, a little theme park where her favorite ride is the Flying Chairs. Although Ethan initially goes to continue his search for the accountant, he leaves to meet with Zooey. They go on the ride and have hot chocolate after. She tells him she has to go and study with her lab partner.\n\nEthan goes to a store and is attacked by a man wielding a shotgun. He blasts Ethan, but he rises unharmed (he was most likely wearing a vest), and the two of them fight. The man nearly kills Ethan by stabbing him in the neck, but the man is shot and he dies. Ethan then notices the man was holding a photo of Ethan himself.\n\nEthan goes home to see on Zooey's computer a message from a friend saying she'll meet her at the Tattoo Gallery. Concerned, Ethan rushes to this place and finds a car with Zooey's bag. He breaks into it and finds a flyer from a place called Spider. He goes to Mitat's house and asks the man's twin daughters what Spider is. They tell him it's a soiree house. Ethan goes to Spider, a night club, and sees Zooey drinking with friends. He starts getting dizzy again, and has a swig of vodka to ease up. He follows Zooey near the bathroom and sees three guys harassing her. Ethan is held back by a friend of the boys, but he gets into papa wolf mode and kicks all their asses before getting Zooey out of there.\n\nZooey wakes up the next morning with no memory of the previous night. She's still wearing her dress, and she is about to go to school until Ethan tells her not to go like that. He insists on her riding the bike to school, but she angrily reminds him that he never taught her how to ride. He spends the morning teaching her, earning applause from onlookers. Zooey later tearfully asks him why he's been away for a long time. She thinks he has another family with another daughter, but he assures her that is not the case. As they continue to hang out, Zooey admits that she hit the girl at school because she was hitting on Hugh. They end up meeting Hugh as he is going to take Zooey to school.\n\nEthan locates the accountant, Guido (Bruno Ricci), as he is escorted through the streets. Ethan shoots a tear gas grenade at the car and takes Guido before blowing the van up. He takes Guido to his apartment to exchange the briefcase with codes he had earlier with codes set to trigger explosives that The Wolf and The Albino are in possession of. Zooey calls to tell Ethan that she is going to cook dinner for Hugh, and she wants to make a vegetarian dish. Ethan puts Guido on the phone to tell Zooey about a spaghetti sauce recipe that his mother used.\n\nThat evening, Ethan comes home to find that Jules's daughter is going into labor. She gives birth to a healthy baby girl, and she decides to name it after Ethan due to him allowing them to stay in his home. Jules says they are to leave as promised, but Ethan insists they can stay as long as they want. Jules says the family prefers a smaller home to stay closer to each other.\n\nEthan goes back to Zooey's home and learns that Hugh asked her to prom, but she says she can't dance. Ethan decides to help her out, just as Tina comes home. She watches them dance, bringing tears to her eyes. They have dinner as a family, and Tina tells Ethan later that he ought to tell Zooey about his condition sooner or later. They end up sleeping together.\n\nThe next morning, Vivi calls Ethan to tell him The Albino is staying at the Grand Hotel. Ethan heads there and spots The Wolf. The villains get in a car driven by Mitat. Ethan chases after them, slamming into the car until he pushes them all over a footbridge. The Wolf and The Albino flee, and Ethan spares Mitat so he can return to his family. Ethan chases the villains into the subway, where he starts to get a nosebleed and he begins to feel dizzy. Before he can shoot The Wolf, The Albino drags a barely conscious Ethan toward the train tracks. He waits for the train to come even as The Wolf yells at him to kill Ethan. Ethan regains enough motion to push The Albino in front of the train just as it passes. He passes out and The Wolf flees. He wakes up to see Vivi brought him to her place. She reminds him of The Wolf's escape, but tells him the results of his treatment turned out positive with the drug.\n\nEthan, Zooey, and Tina go to meet with Hugh and his family. His father introduces Ethan to his business partner...The Wolf. They recognize each other and uneasily shake hands. Hugh's parents escort them all into a club. Tina eventually realizes that Ethan is working an assignment. She thinks he's been lying to her but he assures her that he hasn't. The Wolf's men shoot at Ethan, and he runs after them. He kills the goons before cornering The Wolf in an elevator. He shoots the wires on the elevator, causing it to fall and crash to the bottom. Meanwhile, Hugh and Zooey find a private room where they dance and share their first kiss.\n\nThe Wolf crawls out of the elevator, and Ethan finds him. He starts to feel weak again, unable to shoot him. He drops the gun, which The Wolf reaches for until Vivi comes in and pushes it to Ethan to finish the job. Thinking about Tina and Zooey, he refuses and drops the gun. Vivi grabs it and shoots The Wolf herself.\n\nSometime later, Ethan is still staying with Zooey in a house near a beach. He's setting up a Christmas tree (after thinking he wouldn't live to see Christmas), and we hear him talking to Tina, saying there have been bad days, but they are still trying to keep their relationship well. Tina arrives in person, and Ethan acknowledges to her that he hasn't always been there for her and Zooey like he should have been. Zooey comes up to invite her mom in so Ethan can make them hot chocolate. Ethan goes into another room while Tina and Zooey sit together. She asks her mom if Ethan is going to stick around now. Meanwhile, Ethan finds a box with a large syringe and a note from Vivi wishing him a Merry Christmas. She has given him the drug so he can continue to live some more as well as spend time with his family. In the distance, Vivi stands watching the family in their home."

    "3 from Hell": "The film opens with news reports covering the events at the end of the prior film. The reports also reveal that Baby, Otis, and Captain Spaulding miraculously survived being shot and that they will be tried for their crimes. The trial is widely covered and becomes very popular, with many people protesting that the trio are innocent or were only fighting against the system. All three are found guilty and are sentenced to life in prison. Captain Spaulding is executed by lethal injection in prison, however Otis is reunited with his half-brother Winslow Foxworth \"Foxy\" Coltrane. The two manage to escape from jail during some outside prison work and in the process kill Rondo, who was on the same work crew but did not recognize Otis. Meanwhile Baby unsuccessfully seeks parole, as her mental state has greatly deteriorated since incarceration.\n\nOnce free Otis and Foxy begin planning to free Baby from prison. To accomplish this they take the family and friends of Warden Virgil Dallas Harper hostage, demanding that he help Baby sneak out of prison or they will murder everyone. Harper follows their commands and sneaks Baby out of prison by disguising her as a guard, however Otis and Foxy still kill everyone. Now united, the three are undecided as to what to do next but eventually decide to flee to Mexico, a decision that is made more pressing due to the unstable actions of Baby.\n\nOtis, Baby, and Foxy manage to successfully travel to a small town in Mexico that is celebrating the Day of the Dead and hole up in the town's only hotel. They briefly worry about being recognized but dismiss these concerns, unaware that the hotel's owner has recognized them and has alerted Rondo's son Aquarius to their location. The owner keeps them occupied by the celebration and local prostitutes, so as to keep them from moving to another area. The following morning Baby bonds with a local worker, Sebastian, who notices Aquarius's arrival. He warns Baby of the danger before running to warn Otis, just as Aquarius's men break into the whorehouse. Otis and Sebastian manage to hold them off until Foxy arrives and rescues them, after which Otis separates from them to find and kill the hotel owner. During this time Baby manages to kill several of Aquarius's men using a bow and arrow set she took from Harper's house. Eventually Foxy and Baby are captured by Aquarius, who uses them to draw Otis out into the open.\n\nOtis and one of Aquarius's men have a knife fight while Sebastian, who had been shot and left for dead during Foxy and Baby's capture, sneaks up and silently frees Otis's kin. This enrages Aquarius, distracting his man in the knife fight and allowing Otis to gain the upper hand. He, Baby, and Foxy manage to overpower Aquarius, however Sebastian is shot and killed in the process. The film ends with the trio immolating Aquarius before walking off into the town."

    "3-Headed Shark Attack": "A 3-headed shark attacks an atoll where a group of teenagers are partying, killing all of them except one, Mark, who was on a buoy while the rest of the teens were at the beach. The shark then proceeds to attack the Persephone, an underwater research facility studying the Pacific Garbage Patch. The resulting damage causes the facility to explode, killing everybody inside. However, marine biologists Ted Nelson and Laura Thomas escape, as well as a group of activists touring the lab consisting of Greg, Ryan Bennett, Omar and Alison, and college graduate Maggie Peterson, who was applying for a job at the facility, and is also Greg's ex-girlfriend. The island the facility is based on begins to flood, and the group is forced to swim out to the activists' boat as a result, although Laura and Omar are eaten in the process. The others reach the boat, although the shark follows them as they drive. Ryan manages to contact fisherman Max Burns over the radio, and asks for help. Burns is hesitant to believe them, although he reluctantly agrees to help them.\n\nThe shark begins to head toward a party boat carrying teenagers. The group attempts to warn them, although they're too late, as the shark consistently rams into the boat, knocking numerous people into the water where they're eaten. The group manages to board the boat in order to help injured passengers, and Maggie, and Nelson are enlisted as help by passengers Stanley, and Rosemarie Grant to help find Rosemarie's boyfriend Howard, who had disappeared into the abandoned dining area during the chaos. Maggie, Stanley and Nelson find him, and make their way top deck, although, in the process, the shark jumps onto the back of the boat, and eats Nelson. The group realizes they can no longer stay due to the ship sinking, and board the activists' boat with Stanley, Rosemarie, and Howard in tow. However, Ryan stays behind, and attempts to kill the shark by jumping onto its back with an ax. He manages to clip onto the back of the shark, and it soon kills him in retaliation. Running low on fuel, the group is forced to stop at the atoll that the shark attacked earlier. Meanwhile, Burns, and his two men attempt to kill the shark, although Burns' men are killed in the process. Burns manage to decapitate the shark's middle head, seemingly killing it. Burns finds the rest of the group, although the shark recovers, grows three more heads in place of the middle head, and eats Burns.\n\nTraumatized by Burns' death, the group runs inland, where they meet Mark. Maggie theorizes that the shark is attracted to pollution, and that the heads are becoming more aggressive with each other. The group finds two motorboats, and begin to drive away from the island, although the shark attacks one of them carrying Alison, Rosemarie, Howard and Mark, and kills all of them. Meanwhile, Maggie, Stanley and Greg manage to attract the shark's attention by throwing bags of garbage into the water, although Stanley's hand is bitten off. Losing faith, Stanley sacrifices himself by allowing the shark heads to fight over him, resulting in three of the shark's heads getting bitten off, and the shark itself dies of blood loss. Maggie and Greg rekindle their relationship as a helicopter arrives to rescue them."

    "30 Minutes or Less": "The film opens with a beat-up old blue Mustang flying through the air, as its driver launches it at high-speed through a neighborhood in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) works for Vito's Pizza, which has a strict 30-minutes-or-less delivery policy... which means either Nick makes it to the customer's door in half an hour or he has to pay for the pizza himself. There's a timer in the shape of a tiny, stereotypical Italian chef ticking away on his dashboard as Nick races through Grand Rapids, his stereo blaring, past kids playing in parks and other people trying to go about their days with this madman driving on the roads. Nick makes it to his destination, two towns away from Vito's Pizza, in 34 minutes... four minutes late. Two stoned teenagers answer the door, proud of themselves for gaming the system and getting another pizza free. Nick confronts them, telling them the pie's going to come out of his own pocket, but they don't care. \"That's why we order your crappy pizza\", they say, \"because you can't ever get here in time\". Nick decides to scam the scammers by telling them he can get them beer if they give him the money their mom gave them for the pizza. The kids have no idea what they are doing, but think it would be cool to have beer, and Nick tells asks them, \"You like O'Doules, right?\". Clueless, the kids say, \"Hell yah, we're totally down with that shit\".\n\nNick is dejected with his life and heads home, where he drinks real beer (not O'Doules) on his porch waiting for his friend Chet (Aziz Ansari) to get home from a date. Chet's actually sitting in a parked car outside, where his date is performing oral sex on him from the passenger seat. She finishes what she's doing and then quickly moves to kiss him, in a gross-out scene where Chet \"tastes himself\", as Nick (who has been watching) puts it later. \"Do you want some beer to wash the taste of yourself out of your mouth?\", Nick asks Chet when he finally walks over. Nick is a big movie fan and has DVDs of the Lethal Weapon series for Chet and him to watch, but Chet says he's tired and has to work tomorrow. Nick tells him to just call-in sick, \"like the real teachers do\", because Chet's a substitute teacher. \"You know they made me a real teacher a few months ago. You gave me a laser pointer as a congratulations gift,\" Chet scolds Nick, telling him that he's an adult with a career now and can't stay up all night watching old action movies and drinking beer with his pizza delivering friend.\n\nThe next day, Dwayne (Danny McBride) and his dimwit sidekick Travis (Nick Swardson) are target-shooting watermelons in an old scrap yard. Dwayne purports to be a major player and educates Travis about all the \"pussy\" he has gotten, knows about, and obsesses over in general. Travis hangs on every word. Though both are numb skulls, Dwayne is the leader and Travis is the even dimmer follower. The two use crossbows, detonators, and other weapons to blow up the watermelons, with Travis being a kind of idiot savant when it comes to explosives.\n\nDwayne and Travis have been friends since childhood, and though in their mid to late 30s they still behave like immature teenagers. Back at Dwayne's father's house, the two watch \"Friday the 13th: 3D\" where Dwayne starts heckling Jason Vorhees on the screen, as if characters in the film can hear him. Travis follows Dwayne's lead, like always, and the two jump up from their seats pretending they are anal-raping Jason and \"teaching him what good pussy\" is, whatever that means. As they're carrying on with these pantomimes, Dwayne's father \"The Major\" (Fred Ward) walks in, berating Dwayne and his friend for acting so stupid and sexual together. The Major is a retired United States Marine with little tolerance for his ne'er do well son's antics. The Major repeatedly calls his son a \"faggot\" and alludes to something more than friendship between Dwayne and Travis, since the two of them spend so much time together and The Major evidently catches them in weird situations like this quite a bit. It's revealed The Major won a $10 million lottery prize in 1998, which funds an opulent lifestyle for him... and supports unemployed Dwayne. The Major's house is filled with all sorts of high tech gadgets, along with a driveway full of expensive trucks with hyper-patriotic American flag/eagle airbrushed detailing. Dwayne is jealous of his father's money and wants to get control of what's left from the lottery winnings before The Major spends it all on more trucks.\n\nMeanwhile, Nick appears to be on another Vito's pizza run but instead is heading to visit Kate (Dilshad Vadsaria), who works at some sort of event planning/catering company. Kate is Chet's twin sister. Nick has harbored a romantic interest in her for some time. While they are talking, Kate tells Nick that a classmate of theirs from high school, Tom Smalls, has just come out on Facebook as gay.\n\n(Since the actor Jesse Eisenberg was in \"The Social Network\" movie portraying Facebook's founder, this is one of a few in-jokes in the film).\n\nKate tells Nick she has been offered a job with the Four Seasons hotel chain, to take a management training position in the special events department of an Atlanta hotel. Nick clearly does not want Kate to move to Atlanta, so he tells her bad things he's heard about \"Hot-lanta\" from various rap songs. He tells Kate he will make her a mixed CD of these raps to prove it to her.\n\nAcross town, in a sleazy strip club, Dwayne's bought a lap dance from a stripper named Juicy (Bianca Kajlich), who soon realizes that Dwayne's father has a few million dollars. Juicy talks Dwayne into hiring an \"assassin\" she knows from Detroit who will kill his father so Dwayne can inherit his money... and presumably give Juicy a large cut. Juicy bares her large breasts to him, telling Dwayne he can be king and have her as his \"scepter polisher\". The tiny hamster inside Dwayne's head starts to spin in its wheel.\n\nAt Chet's apartment, Nick tells his friend he does not want Kate to move to Atlanta. Chet tells Nick to leave his sister alone, and that she's an adult pursuing her career, unlike Nick who is just a pizza delivery boy in his late 20s. Chet reminds Nick that he ate a Lunchables for dinner the night before, so he can't discourage anyone from being an adult when he's never tried it himself. The two friends then engage in a pissing contest trying to one up each other by revealing bad things they did to each other. Nick did sexual things with a girl Chet liked. Chet told everyone in town that Nick's mother had sex with a life guard at the community pool (which then caused Nick's parents to divorce after Nick's dad was cuckolded and his mother was branded the town slut). Nick tells Chet he had sex with his twin sister Kate after prom, but Chet argues that Nick said he'd slept with some other girl... Nick says he only changed the girl's name, but that everything else he told him about the sex was true. Chet is horrified. Nick pushes it by asking, since the two are twins, if Chet felt it when Nick was having sex with Kate. The two friends then wrestle around on the floor for dominance, upset with each other. Chet puts Nick into a sleeper hold, upset with him for deflowering his twin sister.\n\nBack at The Major's mansion, Dwayne and Travis are cleaning the pool for $10 an hour. Dwayne believes he sleeps late and has no job because his dreams are too big to allow him to do anything else. He has many delusions of grandeur, including schemes for various businesses that will make him rich, if only he had the seed money to get them going (such as a Chinese restaurant or an abortion clinic). He also wants to open a tanning salon that would really be a front for a brothel, where various code words would be used by men looking for prostitutes. There would be regular tanning as well, but a \"Deluxe Tan\" would mean a man wanted oral sex after his irradiation. Travis, of course, thinks Dwayne is a genius. The Major, however, thinks his son's an idiot and pops in to check on his pool cleaning work. Dwayne resents his father and tells Travis of the plan to hire an assassin to kill him... something Travis is disturbingly very quick to agree to. Dwayne tells Travis that it will cost $100,000 to hire the assassin and that they need to start thinking like millionaires...since once he gets that $100,000 and hires someone to kill his father, he will inherit the millions and will \"own the whole town\".\n\nDwayne and Travis hole up in Travis' garage where they continue to plot ways to get the $100,000 for the assassin. Dwayne entertains the fantasy of finding a woman who he can have sex with on camera, and then force to have sex with all sorts of other men on camera, so they can blackmail her husband and force him to rob a bank for them. But the two decide they don't know any married women who are \"slutty enough\" for that. Dwayne wants to use hypnotism to force a man to rob a bank for them, but Travis reminds Dwayne how adroit he is manufacturing explosives, so the two decide to find someone, strap a bomb to him, and force him to rob a bank if he wants to live. While they are trying to decide what sort of guy they could lure into this trap, a commercial for Vito's Pizza airs and Dwayne decides to use a pizza delivery guy as his patsy. Dwayne says that Fate's fat cock has slapped him in the face.\n\nAt the scrap yard from earlier in the film, which is super creepy at night. Nick was supposed to be off work, but Vito (Brett Gelman) made him take one last pizza run. Nick makes it to the scrap yard 15 minutes late and is worried he will have to pay for another late order. When he knocks on a derelict trailer to deliver the pie, Dwayne answers in a creepy gorilla mask. Nick's nervous, and tries backing away but Travis (in a very Planet of the Apes chimpanzee mask) knocks him over the head until he passes out. Nick's screaming RAPE! the whole time. When he comes to, it's daylight and Dwayne and Travis have strapped a bomb to his chest. Nick tries calling for help, but the scrap yard is very isolated and Dwayne tells him he'd have a better chance of someone hearing him in outer space. The bomb's made with C-4 explosives wired to a remote detonator that is activated with a cellphone. There's a lock on the front with a 6-digit combination, which Dwayne says he'll give Nick when Nick delivers him $100,000. The bomb has a large yellow smiley face on the front.\n\nNick tells them he can sell his car and get maybe $1,000, but that he does not have any idea how he can get $100,000. Dwayne tells him to just rob a bank. And that he has 10 hours until the bomb explodes so he better move quickly. To demonstrate the bomb, Dwayne detonates a similar vest that Travis rigged to a teddy bear. After it explodes, he tells Nick, \"I liked that bear, and I don't even know you, so you better hurry\". Nick's told the pair will be watching him and if he goes to the police they will dial the code and make him explode like the bear. Nick burns rubber peeling out of the scrap yard, off to rob a bank and do whatever they say.\n\nNick heads to the school where Chet works and interrupts his teaching. Chet's scolding a boy who has been texting in class, by reading the boy's text about liking a girl named Lisa. \"This Lisa? Over here? She's too good for you. Stop texting in my class,\" he tells the boy, just as Nick barges in. Outside in the hallway Nick shows Chet the bomb and Chet says, \"So two dudes kidnap you and strap a bomb to your chest and the first place you think to go is an elementary school filled with children?\". Nick begs Chet to help him and Chet ultimately agrees, because he says he does not want this to affect his future relationships...like one day he would be with his wife and kids and he'd be sorry he \"let that guy I knew blow up\" when he could have helped. Chet makes Nick promise him that if he helps him with this that he will leave his sister alone and not talk to Kate again. The two leave the school to figure out a way to get the bomb vest off Nick.\n\nMeanwhile, Juicy the stripper meets with her \"assassin\" from Detroit, a Mexican named Changa who calls himself \"Sugarmilk\" (Michael Pena) and is covered with tattoos. Changa agrees to kill The Major and Juicy tells him arrangements have been made to get him his $100,000 for the hit. Juicy and Changa have a romantic relationship and have sex in his car apparently.\n\nBack at Chet's apartment. Chet's been looking up ways to disarm the bomb on Wikipedia, with little luck. Various movies like Hurt Locker and Point Break are referenced, as the two friends try thinking about anything they've ever seen on film that could help them either disarm the bomb or rob a bank to get the $100,000. Ultimately, they decide to rob the bank and Nick tells Chet they should hit the bank that's near the Olive Garden in a shopping center. They proceed to a Family Dollar store to get bank robbing supplies.\n\nDwayne and Travis are watching them, and sit outside in a car listening to a mixed tape while Nick and Chet buy their supplies. Dwayne keeps talking about his tanning salon/brothel idea and the two talk about various specials they would offer, like a \"Tanny Glover\", which would be the code word for sex with a black female prostitute after buying a tan. Dwayne tells Travis that he will be working the front desk at the tanning salon, but Travis does not think it's an important enough job, though Dwayne reassures him it's important because Travis would be the one keeping track of the code words and what various people want in terms of prostitutes. There's actually a vacant storefront next to the Family Dollar store that Dwayne thinks would be perfect for the salon/brothel.\n\nThe woman working checkout in Family Dollar asks Nick and Chet if they are buying rape kits, since they're purchasing fake guns and ski masks along with other odd items. Chet's also getting a hamburger sliders kit, so he tells the checkout woman she's crazy, and that they just love sliders and skiing. The woman tells them they better get some condoms too if they are going to be raping anyone. After they leave the store, Chet's spray-painting the toy guns black so they look more real, and Nick tells him not to spray that paint inside his car. \"This car looks like a Mustang that got AIDS and died of cancer\", Chet says, and the two have a fight over how pathetic Nick's car is. They then decide to steal the red Dotson owned by Chet's parents' neighbors, the Fishers, because they need a fast getaway vehicle. They drive over to the Fishers house and are looking for the keys to the car in the garage when Mr. Fisher walks in on them. The two know the Fishers' son Dylan works at a travel agency, is \"a douche\", and has \"bad bangs\". They tell Mr. Fisher that if he doesn't cooperate, they will come after Dylan. Wearing their masks and brandishing their fake guns, they rob him of his keys and steal the car, with Chet politely saying \"Thank you\" and \"Goodbye Mr. Fisher\" afterwards...which is something Chet does throughout the various crimes the two will commit all day.\n\nChet is worried he was recognized because there are only four Indian families in Grand Rapids and he realizes his brown skin and hands were visible through the robbers' disguise. Nick claims he wants to make a quick stop and quit his pizza delivery job before they rob the bank, and Chet argues with him in the car that they don't have time to be running errands like this, and if they did have time like that they should stop for breakfast or maybe lunch because Chet is hungry. Nick gets his way and they drive to Vito's Pizza where Nick slips inside, quits, and then races out the back door. Nick actually runs down the street to where Kate works while Chet thinks he's still inside Vito's. Nick takes Kate onto the roof of her building and tells her that he's never forgotten the night they had sex and that he has feelings for her, then he rushes away. Nick doesn't realize it, but Travis was following him the whole time, and was pretending to be a maintenance man working on the banister in the stairwell when Nick ran by him. Travis reports back to Dwayne on his cellphone that Nick came to visit this girl (important later).\n\nNick races back to the car and finds Chet inside eating hamburgers and drinking 5-Hour-Energy drinks. The two decide to pretend to be Hispanic criminals when they burst into the bank to rob it. Nick will be \"Cruz\" and Chet will be \"Luiz\" when they're inside the bank. When they burst in, the bank is filled with very nice Midwestern people who are surprisingly helpful during the holdup. Nick and Chet get them all onto the floor and work with a bank employee named Sandra to get $100,000 into a bag. Sandra had to go into the vault to get the money, which broke a rule Nick and Chet learned from the movie Point Break, which said to never worry about the vault and instead just focus on whatever money was in the teller drawers. Sandra slips a blue dye bomb back into the money, per bank policy. In all the commotion, a security guard's gun accidentally goes off and shoots a man in the leg. Nick feels bad about this and decides to peel off some money and give it to the man. When he does so, the blue dye explodes in the man's face. Nick and Chet are upset with Sandra, and tell her to get a new pack of money out of the vault... this time with no blue dye in it. Sandra retrieves a new bag... but what Nick and Chet don't realize is that the blue dye packs are in ALL the money (important later). The bank's alarm goes off and Nick and Chet flee the bank, stopped outside by a cop who pulls a gun on them. Chet opens his coat to show his bomb, telling the cop, \"Looks like you brought a gun to a bomb fight\". The cop takes one look at the bomb and runs away crying. Nick and Chet escape in the Dotson and engage in a high speed police chase set to the 80s song \"The Heat is On\". Nick uses his pizza delivery driving skills to evade the cop cars, zooming in and out of traffic, and getting a cop car or two totaled at intersections when Nick guns it through red lights. Nick attempts to do a 180 turn to throw the cops off, but spins too much and ends up doing a full 360, defeating his purpose. Finally, Nick and Chet are wrecked when a cop car smashes into them. They escape the scene of the crash on foot, with Chet wounded by car shrapnel, and the two calmly walk onto a bus to get away. Dwayne and Travis arrive at the scene and join passersby who are videotaping the wreckage for YouTube, pleased that Nick has actually pulled off the robbery.\n\nWalking down a suburban street to reclaim Nick's Mustang, Nick and Chet recount their bank robbery adventure the way two male friends would retell some exploit in a bar or what they did in a big game, with each embellishing things they said or did. Neither of them show any concern at all for all the crimes they just committed. The next step is for Nick to call Dwayne and arrange a pickup of the money -- where Nick essentially buys the 6-digit code that will unlock the bomb on his chest.\n\nDwayne's waiting for the call at a cheap Mexican restaurant called Taco Boy. Dwayne calls Juicy on his cell and tells her the money is coming, and arranges for Juicy and Changa to meet Nick at an abandoned bridge somewhere in just a few minutes. Dwayne revels in more fantasies about owning his tanning salon/brothel, as Travis starts to feel bad about what they have done, now that he realizes Dwayne wants to kill Nick by detonating the bomb after they've got the money. Travis believed Nick would go free once this was all over. When Dwayne gets up to use the bathroom, Travis disables the bomb via remote by switching the cell phone numbers...so if Dwayne tries to deactivate the bomb, he will call the wrong number and nothing will happen.\n\nNick's waiting at the bridge when Changa and Juicy show up. Chet's hiding somewhere off screen. Nick gives Changa the money and asks for the code to deactivate the bomb but Changa doesn't have it... since Dwayne had no intention of deactivating the bomb. A fight ensues, with Chet joining in to smack Changa upside the head, before Chet and Juicy tussle. Nick and Chet leave, with Chet calling them \"bad people\". Changa is furious and tells Dwayne that he is now going to assassinate Dwayne, since he does not have the $100,000 anymore because Nick and Chet took it back after they fought with Changa and Juicy. Dwayne is terrified that the assassin is now coming after him. Nick realizes that Dwayne had no intention of giving him the code, and when he talks to Dwayne on the phone the power shifts between them since Nick also realizes that Dwayne can't push the button to kill him since Dwayne would destroy all the money too. \"At least I will die a rich man,\" Nick says.\n\nTravis is giving Dwayne a haircut while all of this is going down, with Dwayne now insisting that the FBI, CIA, and NASA are going to be coming for him. He wants to just blow Nick up anyway, and dials the number on the phone only to have Moviefone answer. Travis then explains he switched the number at Taco Boy because he couldn't believe Dwayne would kill Nick. Travis then tells Dwayne about Kate, and how she is a way to get the money back from Nick without killing anyone. All they have to do is kidnap her. Dwayne and Travis then rush to do this, while avoiding Changa who wants to kill Dwayne.\n\nThe Major is in his mansion watching the 'Real Housewives of Atlanta', and enjoying himself, when Changa breaks in to assassinate Dwayne. The Major picks up a pen gun and moves stealthily through his house, using his Marines training. We see the giant $10 million lottery check that The Major won in 1998 framed and hanging on a wall as The Major moves through is home, ultimately shooting Changa in the neck... before Changa gets on top of him and shoots him in the stomach. The Major tells Changa he is not afraid of death and \"will ride you all the way to Hell, because I know the way\" as the two men fight. The Major would not tell Changa where Dwayne was, though he was not surprised that Dwayne had tried to hire Changa to kill The Major. The Major still protected his son, even after his son betrayed him. Changa leaves The Major wounded and bleeding from his stomach onto the floor and heads to the bathroom to pour alcohol over his wound, telling himself in the mirror that he's a pimp and needs to be tough. Changa then searches the house for clues to where Dwayne may be and ends up finding a crudely drawn map (like a small child made it) of the scrap yard that Dwayne and Travis use for their antics.\n\nBack at the scrap yard, Dwayne and Travis are heading there with kidnapped Kate, while Nick and Chet are driving there to deliver the money and rescue her. Nick produces the cash and Dwayne gives him the code...696969, which Dwayne reveals to be his favorite sexual position. There's now just 4 minutes and 9 seconds before the bomb explodes. Dwayne's wearing his gorilla mask again and Travis is dressed up as the chimp, but this time he's also wearing a flamethrower on his back that makes him look like a Ghostbuster on the Planet of the Apes.\n\nNick gains the upper hand by claiming he has a sniper hidden somewhere who will shoot Dwayne and Travis. They don't believe him, but a red dot appears on Dwayne's forehead, which Travis says \"looks like that dot on her people's heads\", making a racist joke at the expense of Kate, who is Indian like her brother Chet. It's shown the sniper is actually Chet, using the laser pointer that Nick bought him when he was made a real teacher and not just a substitute (remember the throwaway line delivered about this earlier in the film). Chet moves the laser pointer lower so that it appears the sniper is going to shoot Dwayne in the chest if he does not release Kate.\n\nChanga arrives and declares himself to be \"the Satanic Hispanic\" and punches Nick in the face in retribution for the attack Chet made on him earlier in the day. Then Changa turns his attention to Dwayne and fires his gun at him. Travis fires up the flamethrower next and scorches Changa, burning him to a crisp. Changa gets one last shot off, however, and punctures the tank on Travis' back, making the flamethrower explode. In this melee, Chet grabs Kate as Nick ducks away to grab the money and place the bomb vest into Dwayne's car after resetting the timer to explode.\n\nChanga dies. Travis lives. Dwayne gets in the car to chase down Nick, Chet, and Kate and get the $100,000 back. Since Nick knows the bomb is about to explode, he maneuvers his Mustang to avoid the blast. Dwayne's car catches fire and flips off the road with him still inside.\n\nAs they drive away, Nick, Chet, and Kate then start thinking about what they could do with all that stolen bank money. When Kate starts flipping through the stacks of bills, the blue dye explodes in their faces and all over the car.\n\nTHE END\n\nAs the credits roll, there is a quick commercial for \"Major Tan\"... the tanning salon/brothel that it appears Dwayne, Travis, and The Major opened next to the Family Dollar Store. A bevy of bikini clad prostitutes vamp it up in the commercial, as Dwayne lets viewers know it's both a tanning salon and a place for men to get oral sex from a variety of women... including a \"Menage a Tan\" where two women would service one man.\n\n(Apparently, this bit was part of the original ending of the film...which was supposed to include an epilogue showing what happened to all the various characters. The Major is now in a wheelchair because of his bullet wound and Dwayne and Travis appear unscathed by everything that happened. After this commercial ends, the film is completely over and it fades to black.)"

    "300": "Spartan customs are harsh. The Spartans inspect each infant born to ensure it is whole - if it is deformed, the baby is abandoned to die. They raise their boys in the school of hard knocks, the agoge - in combat training, a small boy's loss of his weapon earns a bloody lip from the hand of his own father. At age 7, each young boy is torn from his mother and makes his own way in the wilderness, to return a man. Even the King endures this rite of passage. At age 15, young King-to-be Leonidas (Tyler Neitzel) lures a wolf into a narrow passage so that he can kill it. He returns home to be crowned King.\n\nYears later, messengers visit King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) requesting Sparta's submission to King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro). Insulted by their attitude, King Leonidas kicks the messengers into a well. Acknowledging the threat of Xerxes's invasion force, he visits the Ephors (priests) to obtain their favour before sending the Spartan army in battle. He proposes to repel the numerically superior enemy by using the terrain of the Hot Gates of Thermopylae, funneling the Persians into a narrow pass between the rocks and the sea, where their immense numbers will \"count for nothing.\" The Ephors, wary of the plan, consult the Oracle (Kelly Craig). In her drugged trance she decrees that Sparta must not go to war, lest they interrupt the sacred Carneian festival. Leonidas departs in anger, and the priests receive their bribe of Xerxes' gold from the Spartan traitor, Theron (Dominic West), for their negative response.\n\nLeonidas is reluctant to defy the corrupt clergy outright, but his wife (Lena Headey) encourages him to think outside the box. Leonidas elects to take 300 of his best soldiers as his \"bodyguard\" on a leisurely walk to the strategic Hot Gates location. His wife says goodbye, telling him to come back \"with his shield or on it\", and gives him a necklace.\n\nOn the road they meet some allies, who are shocked that the Spartans are sending such a small force. Leonidas asks the professions of the allied army, who are craftsmen and artisans. He points out that he has brought more soldiers than they. Joined by Arcadians and other Greeks, they arrive at Thermopylae. In sight of the approaching Persian army, they construct a wall to contain the Persians' advance. Strong storms destroy some of Xerxes fleet, but it is only a small percentage of the massive army they will face.\n\nA horribly disfigured man, Ephialtes (Andrew Tiernan), comes to see Leonidas to warn him of a disused goat path at the rear of his position. Ephialtes claims that his parents fled Sparta at his birth to save his life. He hopes to redeem them by fighting for Leonidas. Leonidas explains that each Spartan warrior is a key part of the phalanx, and asks Ephialtes to show that he can lift his shield high enough to properly defend his fellow warriors. When it becomes evident that he cannot, Leonidas gently tells him to care for the fallen instead. Ephialtes' fondest hopes are crushed.\n\nA Persian emissary arrives, and finds that the corpses of the previous scouting party now make up part of the large rock wall. The Persian states that their arrows will blot out the sun, and the Spartans agree they will simply fight in the shade. The emissary's party is killed.\n\nPrior to the battle the Persians demand that the Spartans drop their arms and surrender. Leonidas refuses and challenges the Persians to come and take their weapons from them. With their tightly-knit phalanx formation, the Spartans funnel the Persians into the narrow terrain, repeatedly rebuffing them and inflicting heavy casualties.\n\nXerxes, impressed with Spartan fighting skill, personally approaches Leonidas to persuade him to surrender. He promises Leonidas wealth and power in exchange for his loyalty. Leonidas declines, promising instead to make the \"God King\" bleed, and turns to rejoin his army.\n\nDismayed at the refusal, Xerxes sends his masked personal guard, \"The Immortals\", which name the Spartans also prove false. The battles continue, with the Spartans prevailing over soldiers and animals drawn from the vast reaches of the Persian empire: from Mongolian barbarians and Eastern chemists to African rhinoceroses and Indian war elephants. However, some of the brave Spartan warriors are killed, and it becomes clear that more will follow.\n\nEphialtes goes to Xerxes, and agrees to show the goat path to the Persians in exchange for a uniform, along with promises of women and wealth. Xerxes will grant Ephialtes his wish if he will kneel before the god king.\n\nBack in Sparta, Queen Gorgo has been trying to convince the council to send help to Leonidas. A friendly councilman arranges for her to speak, but explains that she will need Theron on her side. Theron agrees to help her if she will sleep with him - so she does.\n\nAt the Hot Gates, the Spartans learn they have been betrayed, and know their fight is doomed. The Arcadians retreat in the face of certain death. The Spartans refuse to follow. Leonidas orders a reluctant Dilios to return to Sparta and tell of their inevitable deaths.\n\nIn Sparta, Queen Gorgo makes her appeal to the council. Instead of supporting her as promised, Theron betrays her, accusing her of adultery. Enraged, Gorgo snatches a sword and stabs Theron, rupturing a bag of gold hidden in his robe. As the coins stamped with Persian markings spill onto the ground, the Council realizes Theron's treachery and agree to unite against Persia.\n\nAt the Hot Gates, as the Persians surround the Spartans, who have created a dome out of their shields. Leonidas stands along in front of the dome. Xerxes's general demands their surrender, declaring that Leonidas may keep his title as King of Sparta and become Warlord of all Greece, answerable only to Xerxes. Ephialtes urges this as well, to which Leonidas remarks, \"May you live forever,\" an insult from a culture valuing death and valor in battle. Leonidas drops his shield and removes his helmet, seemingly bowing in submission. Stelios then bursts out of the dome and leaps over his king and kills the general. A furious Xerxes orders his troops to attack. As Persian archers shoot the remaining Spartans, Leonidas rises and hurls his spear at Xerxes, ripping open his cheek, thus making \"the God-King bleed.\" Xerxes, visibly shaken by this reminder of his own mortality, watches as the remaining Spartans perish beneath the combined might of his army. Leonidas himself marks his final moments by telling his wife aloud that he loves her. A rain of arrows falls upon him and the screen goes black. Back in Sparta, Dilios gives the necklace to Queen Gorgo and tells her of her husband's fate.\n\nConcluding his tale before an audience of attentive Spartans, Dilios declares that the 120,000-strong Persian army that narrowly defeated 300 Spartans now faces 10,000 Spartans commanding 30,000 Greeks. Praising Leonidas's sacrifice, Dilios leads the assembled Greek army into a fierce charge against the Persian army, igniting the Battle of Plataea."

    "3000 Miles to Graceland": "The film opens outside of Las Vegas, in the scorching Nevada desert. Michael (Kurt Russell) stops at the Last Resort Hotel and Cafe, where he gets a room. As he is going back to his car, a little kid named Jesse (David Kaye) takes two of the custom skullhead valve caps off of Michael's car. Michael chases him, but Jesse kicks him in the shin. Jesse then runs into the arms of his young mother Cybil (Courteney Cox Arquette), who makes Jesse give back the caps. Michael is immediately attracted to her, and asks her to breakfast. He then has sex with her. Later, a car with four men dressed like Elvis pull up, Murphy (Kevin Costner), Hanson (Christian Slater), Gus (David Arquette), and Franklin (Bokeem Woodbine). Murphy picks up Michael from the motel, and the five of them venture out to an airplane hangar, where they meet yet another con, Jack (Howie Long), a helicopter pilot. Inside the hangar are five suit and guitar cases. Michael goes back to the motel, where he knocks on Cybil's door looking for his missing wallet, which her son took. She reaches into a crawlspace in the ceiling and finds Michael's wallet, and gives it back to him. He is about to leave, but Cybil yet again lures him back into bed.\n\nThe next day, Michael drives back to Las Vegas. He joins the other four men, who are all dressed up as Elvis. It's International Elvis Week in Las Vegas, so everybody there is dressed as The King. Michael and Murphy's plan is to rob the Riviera Casino in broad daylight, dressed as Elvis, so no one can identify them. As the five are walking towards the money cages in the back, a previous acquaintance of Murphy's recognizes him and greets him. Murphy ends up knocking him out in order to keep his anonymity. As they get closer to the back, Michael breaks off, and gets into an elevator. The rest of them burst into the room, with machine guns, and grab the money. The security cameras watch all of this, and notify the hotel security and Vegas PD. The plan is not to walk out into the streets, but rather get to the roof, and be picked up by Jack in the helicopter. Murphy and the other three are almost at the elevators, where Michael is waiting, but Murphy sets off panic when he blows away a security guard. A huge gunfight occurs within the casino, with the security being mostly cut down to size. Michael opens the elevator door, and sees a security guy with his back to him. Michael is about to shoot him, but knocks him out instead. As the men enter the elevator, a Las Vegas police officer starts shooting into the elevator, hitting Franklin in the chest. Murphy sticks his gun through the crack in the doors and shoots the officer in the head. They make it to the roof, but Jack isn't there yet. They hold off the cops and security on the roof, until Jack arrives. Murphy tries to save Franklin, but Franklin finally dies from his wounds. Murphy then throws Franklin's dead body out of the helicopter.\n\nThe group now go back to Michael's hotel, where Jesse is hiding and watching everything. Hanson counts the money, which comes out to $3.2 million. The four split up the money. Hanson also decides to split up Franklin's cut, but Murphy refuses, saying Franklin's cut should go to him. Hanson gets upset with Murphy and points his gun at him, but doesn't shoot him. After he puts his gun away and sits back down Murphy shoots Hanson under the table hitting him in the leg, then shoots him again in the chest killing him. Gus, Michael, and Murphy now have to dispose of the body, so Michael hides the money in the crawlspace, and the three drive out to the middle of the desert to bury Hanson. While there, Murphy shoots Gus and Michael as well. Murphy is driving back, in Michael's car, when several coyotes wander out onto the road, causing Murphy to hit one and swerve off the road into a ditch, where he is knocked unconscious. The news spreads about the robbery, making headlines, and sparking the interest of two federal marshals, Quigley (Thomas Haden Church) and Damitry (Kevin Pollak). They learn that Murphy is the mastermind, thanks to the man that Murphy knocked out in the casino. They also learn that Murphy thinks he's the son of Elvis. Michael, left for dead suddenly awakes, and hitchhikes back to his hotel room. He takes two bullets out of his bulletproof vest. He reaches into the crawlspace to get the money, but it's missing. Michael storms into Cybil's place and grabs Jesse. Cybil threatens to call the police, but Michael suddenly finds the money, causing Cybil to hang up. Michael decides to pay Cybil off with $100,000 for silence, but Cybil wants to go with him. Suddenly, the police knock at the door, responding to Cybil's emergency call. The police believe that Cybil dial 911 by accident and Michael leaves the hotel with Cybil and Jesse.\n\nThe next morning, Murphy drives back to the hotel, but does not find the money. Michael explains to Cybil that the money is marked, but Murphy worked out a deal with a real estate man in Twin Falls, Idaho named J. Peterson (Jon Lovitz), who would exchange the money with them for 70 cents to the dollar, so they're on their way to meet him. However, Murphy is following them. Along the way, he kills almost everyone he meets. Meanwhile, Michael, Cybil and Jesse are eating at a restaurant, but Cybil cleverly sneaks away, and steals Michael's wallet and car. So now, Michael is stuck with Jesse, with no car or money. Jesse, however, is a clever thief, and steals money through pickpocketing and even steals a truck for Michael. Cybil calls J. Peterson and says the password, \"Cleanliness is next to godliness.\" Peterson decides to wait for her, but Murphy suddenly appears, saying the same thing. Peterson explains that Cybil called first, so he must wait for her.\n\nFinally, Cybil arrives, and finds only Murphy, who she assumes is Peterson. Then, Michael and Jesse arrive, and find the place empty, except for Peterson's dead body in the bathroom, next to a dead woman. Jesse starts to cry, thinking it's his mother, but it's really Peterson's secretary. Murphy is driving Michael's car, so Michael calls the cops and reports his car stolen. Murphy is then arrested, but Michael is also arrested when it is learned that the truck he is driving is stolen as well. Murphy and Michael are put in neighboring jail cells, where Murphy explains how he thought Michael was dead. Michael asks where the girl is, but Murphy is very obscure about his answer. Suddenly, Michael makes bail, thanks to Jesse, who hired a lawyer, under the agreement that Jesse make him his partner. Michael is set free, however, with his one phone call, Murphy calls Jack and arranges to get out as well. Michael and Jesse get to Michael's car, and opens the trunk, and finds Cybil, tied up but still alive. Murphy is now out, and is hitchhiking. He is picked up by a college football fan, with team attire and face-paint. When they come to a roadblock, Murphy kills the fan, and puts on his clothes. He pretends to be a fan in front of the cops, and they let him go. Murphy sees Cybil and Jesse pass by in a car. He runs them off the road, and grabs Jesse, to hold as collateral so that Cybil will go get Michael and the money. Cybil finally finds Michael and he decides to go find Jesse.\n\nMurphy has met back up with Jack, who has enlisted the help of a one-man army by the name of Hamilton (Ice-T). Michael appears with the money, and puts a gun to Jack's head, and offers to exchange for Jesse. Murphy and Michael swap, but it is revealed that the bag with the money is actually filled with newspaper and a scorpion that stings Murphy's arm as he reaches into the bag. Suddenly, a SWAT team, led by Quigley and Damitry, surround the place. Murphy puts his hands up, but quickly grabs a shotgun and shoots Michael. Another huge gunfight ensues, with Jack and Murphy shooting their fair amount of cops. When some cops are about to shoot Murphy, Jack jumps in the way and is shot. As the police are surrounding him, Hamilton appears and shoots many cops. Quigley, however, shoots Hamilton. Murphy is now alone, getting weaker from the scorpion sting and the marshals realize that he's not giving up. Murphy is finally put down, after a barrage of bullets tear into him. Michael is rushed by ambulance to the nearest hospital. However, the ambulance is stolen by Cybil and Jesse. Michael, once again, wore a bulletproof vest, and is only injured in the shoulder. The last scene shows Michael, Cybil, and Jesse on Michael's boat, sailing away. The name on the side of the boat reads Graceland. Implying Michael was the other illegitimate son of Elvis, as 2 of the 75 alleged illegitimates were real."

    "300: Rise of an Empire": "Note: this film is actually a prequel as well as a sequel to the original '300' film (with the events happening before, concurrently, and after the events of the previous film).\n\nIn the opening scene, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) narrates about King Darius (Igal Naor) leading his army of Persians into Greece in the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC during the first Persian invasion of Greece. The Athenian general Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) led his own army against them at the shores. The Greeks brutally and effortlessly take down the invading Persians one by one, paving the way for Themistocles to take aim at Darius, who is watching the massacre of his men from his ship offshore. Themistocles raises a bow and arrow, ready to commit the act that would make him known as a legend. He releases the bow just in time for Darius's son, Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) to watch. He runs to his father's side but is too late to save him as the arrow pierces him. Xerxes holds his father in his arms and locks eyes with Themistocles. The latter walks away, with Gorgo stating that he knew in his heart that he made a mistake not to kill Xerxes when he had the chance.\n\nDarius is returned to his kingdom to lie in his deathbed. He and Xerxes are joined by Artemisia (Eva Green), Darius's commanding naval officer, said to be as vicious as she is beautiful. She holds Darius's hand. In his dying moments, he tells Xerxes that it is best to leave the Greeks alone, for only the gods can defeat them. Artemisia pulls the arrow out of his chest to end his suffering. For a week, Xerxes sits and mourns the death of his father. On the eighth day, Artemisia holds Xerxes and tells him that his father's last words were not a warning, but a challenge. If only the gods can defeat the Greeks, then, she tells him, he is to become the god king.\n\nArtemisia has Xerxes sent into the desert wearing chains until he walks into a cave with a pool of bright gold liquid. Xerxes steps in, with, as Gorgo states, a dark desire for power and revenge. Xerxes emerges with a golden tinge and fiery red eyes, also hairless and a foot taller. Meanwhile, Artemisia kills off all of the former allies of the man that Xerxes used to be. He returns to Persia and stands before the citizens, with Artemisia right behind him. He declares, \"For glory's sake...WAR!\" The Persians cheer this on loudly.\n\nTen years later (in 480 BC), Xerxes makes plans to lead his army on land through Thermopylae while Artemisia is prepared to ready her navy at sea. The second Persian invasion of Greece begins.\n\nIn Athens, Themistocles meets with the council to discuss his own naval strategy for taking on the invading Persians. Although the Athenians want to desperately bring the Persians down, they are not keen on sending their men to sacrifice themselves in battle. Themistocles insists that it is in the best interests of Greece that they fight for the sake of freedom, and so he demands that he be brought the best ships to go into battle. He also tells the council he will seek help from the Spartans.\n\nThemistocles travels to Sparta to request help from King Leonidas and his army. He walks in on a training session where a group of Spartans beat down on one man as he tries to fight back. The man gets bloodied up good.. Themistocles encounters Dilios (David Wenham), who tells him that Leonidas has already begun to lead his men on foot, adding that he already dealt with the emissary sent from Persia. Queen Gorgo speaks with Themistocles to tell him that the Spartans do not share the same ideal of a free nation in the same way that he does.\n\nMeanwhile, a prisoner is brought before Artemisia on her ship. He chastises two of her guards for being Greeks working under a woman with Greek blood but a devotion to an enemy nation. Artemisia grabs her sword and says she may be Greek, but her heart is Persian. She decapitates the man and throws his head off the ship. She sees a soldier on the ship that she is unfamiliar with. \"Well, then, allow me to introduce myself\", he boasts, before killing off several Persians. He is Scyllias (Callan Mulvey), an Athenian soldier sent to spy on the Persians. He jumps into the sea and avoids being hit by the arrows of the Persians.\n\nScyllias, along with his son Calisto (Jack O'Connell), reports back to Themistocles and his lieutenant Aekylos (Hans Matheson). Scyllias tells them that the Persians are being led at sea by Artemisia. It is believed that she is the sole survivor of an attack on her town.\n\nThrough a flashback, we learn of her background story. As a child, a helpless and terrified Artemisia watched tearfully as her mother and father were slaughtered right before her eyes. A soldier from the invading side, walks to Artemisia and kicks her square in the face. Over the years, the soldiers raped and abused the girl until they left her on the side of the streets for dead. She is found by the Persian emissary (Peter Mensah; the same one that Leonidas kicked into the bottomless pit in the previous '300' film) and is looked after by him. She planned to return to Greece when she was ready to watch it burn. Over time, the emissary trains Artemisia in combat. She proves to be quick and dangerous, and as an adult, she carries many severed heads of Darius's enemies and brings them to him, earning her the position of his general. Even with this knowledge in mind, Themistocles prepares his strategy for the battle. Aekylos points out that their small navy against the much larger Persian navy outnumbers them and that the mission is suicide. \"Such is the plan,\" Themistocles replies.\n\nIn the present, Themistocles, confident in his men, leads them all out to the Aegean Sea, where Artemisia is leading her navy. Her general Artaphernes (Ben Turner) tells her that General Bandari (Ashraf Barhom) has prepared his strategy to lead the ships against the Greeks (thus beginning the naval Battle of Artemisium). Themistocles stirs up confidence by encouraging the men to fight with those standing by their side. The Athenians ram their ships into the Persian ships, charging at them with full force and fury. This leads to another bloody fight with many Persians dying at the hands of the Athenians. Scyllias and Calisto fight side-by-side, with Calisto hurling his spears at the Persians.\n\nArtemisia, displeased with the results, has Bandari chained and thrown into the sea where he sinks to his watery grave. The generals think she is disappointed with the loss of her men, but she admits to being disappointed in them specifically. She ponders the thought of having somebody standing by her side.\n\nThe next day, the Athenians cause the Persians to sail their ships through a crevice, causing the leading ship to get stuck and have the other ships crash into it. From atop the cliffs, the Athenians jump in and continue to slaughter the Persians. The second general to lead them, Kashani (Christopher Scieueref) is killed by Themistocles. Scyllias sees Calisto jumping into the fight, but clearly not wanting to see his son get hurt. Artemisia watches from her ship, admiring Themistocles's tactics and command.\n\nArtaphernes rides a boat to the shores where the Athenians have set up camp to bring Themistocles onto Artemisia's barge. She commends his skill during the battle when she takes him into her private chambers. She asks him if there happens to be somebody back in Athens for whom he fights. Themistocles states that he has had no time for a family or children. Artemisia offers him a chance to join her so that he will not have to live with conflict or responsibility. The two of them then start having rough, passionate, and violent sex (which her guards can clearly hear). When Artemisia echoes her offer, Themistocles simply states no, and Artemisia angrily throws him off of her, hissing to him that he is no god, but merely a man. Themistocles returns to the camp, warning his men that Artemisia is prepared to bring hell to them.\n\nOn the next day of battle, the Persian ships release tar into the ocean, along with several guards swimming out to the Athenians with explosives strapped to their backs. The Athenians fight off the guards until Artemisia fires her arrows. The Persians hurl flaming arrows to ignite the tar. Artemisia fires more arrows, striking three into Scyllias as Calisto watches. On one of the Persian ships, a large Persian hurls torches to continue igniting the fires. He is struck with an arrow, and he drops the torch on himself, setting himself ablaze. He falls off the ship into the spilling tar, sending a wave of fire onto an Athenian ship, but also back onto the Persian ship, causing it to explode. Artemisia sends another flaming arrow to hit the back of a Persian with an explosive on his back, just as he climbs onto Themistocles's ship. He orders everyone to abandon ship and he lunges toward the Persian. Before he can strike him, the explosive goes off and destroys the ship, taking Themistocles down with it. Artemisia watches proudly as her enemy sinks. In the ocean, Themistocles sinks among the bodies of his fallen comrades. He sees two serpent-like creatures swim to them and devour them before one lunges at him.\n\nThemistocles is snapped out of this dream by Calisto. He realizes this event may have been brought upon him to subdue his ego or to remind him of the mistake of not killing Xerxes. Themistocles walks over to Scyllias's side as he is dying. He urges his friend to continue the fight and tells him something else before finally passing. Themistocles mourns his friend. Calisto asks Themistocles what his father's last words were, but Themistocles says he will tell him in time.\n\nMeanwhile on land, Xerxes and his army have just killed off Leonidas and his 300 Spartans after the brutal three-day Battle of Thermopylae (a brief flashback to the previous film). The birds pick at the eyes of the dead Spartans while the Persians continue marching onward victoriously towards Athens. The news of the defeat reaches Themistocles through a messenger. He returns to Sparta to confront Ephialtes (Andrew Tiernan), the deformed hunchback that betrayed the Spartans and sold them out to Xerxes. Seemingly remorseful for his actions, he does not cower when Themistocles lowers his sword to him, saying that there is little beauty in him, and even less in what he's done. Ephialtes adds that Xerxes is leading his army to Athens, preparing to destroy it. Themistocles leaves him alive so that he may carry the message back to the Persians saying that the Greeks will fight to the death.\n\nThemistocles goes to speak to Queen Gorgo. Dilios, now half-blind, warns him to not expect a warm welcome. Gorgo is still in mourning of her husband. Although Themistocles urges her to aid in the continuing battle, she refuses to send anymore husbands, fathers, and sons out to be sacrificed any further. He hands her the sword of Leonidas, saying it belongs with her. Gorgo tears up at the sight of it.\n\nThe Persian army takes Athens. Xerxes holds the head of Leonidas boastfully over the city as his men lay waste to the people and burn everything down. He continues to brag about his victory and states that Themistocles was nothing but a coward. Ephialtes returns to Xerxes and Artemisia to report that the Greeks are continuing to take their battle back into the sea, led again by Themistocles. Hearing his name and realizing he's not dead, Artemisia vows to end the Athenians once and for all. She leaves to prepare her command.\n\nThemistocles acknowledges that his men may be weary of continuing the fight, knowing they too would refuse to see anymore bloodshed. He encourages them to act for themselves and leave now if they wish so that they may maintain their freedom, but also encourages them to stay and fight. \"Let it be shown that we chose to die on our feet, rather than to live on our knees!\" The Athenians cheer.\n\nThe limited number of Athenian ships face the huge Persian fleet at the sea in their final battle. Themistocles tells Calisto his father's final words, which was to say that he has earned himself a place at the table (he's ready to fight). Once again, both Themistocles and Artemisia are set to lead their men into battle. The climatic naval Battle of Salamis begins. Their ships collide, and the Athenians charge against the Persians, fighting quickly and mercilessly. Not ready to stand idly by, Artemisia wields her two swords and fights against the Greeks, killing off as many as she can on her own.\n\nThemistocles rides his horse through the battle until he reaches Artemisia's ship. He reminds her of her earlier offer, stating that he still says no. Angered, she begins to fight him in a duel. He fights with great fury, and she quips that \"he fights harder than he fucks\". They continue to fight until they hold both their swords at each other's necks. Themistocles continues to refuse the idea of joining Artemisia, and he tells her that it is time for her to surrender.\n\nWe see Gorgo leading her army of Spartans, having been telling them the story from the beginning, leading into her own rousing speech as they come closer to surrounding the Persian fleet. In addition, armies from other allied nations join in the fight. Themistocles points this out to Artemisia as he still has her with his sword to her throat. He urges her to surrender. She chooses not to, and she grabs her sword to kill, but Themistocles quickly drives his sword into her stomach. Artemisia drops to her knees. In her final moments, she watches as the allied forces surround her navy. Xerxes, watching from the cliff side, turns his back on her. Artemisia finally collapses, dead, just as Gorgo and Dilios step onto her ship to stand by Themistocles.\n\nThe film ends with the Spartans and Athenians banding together to defeat the Persians once and for all. It was later recorded in history that the naval Battle of Salamis was one of the most decisive battles of the ancient world and the allied Athenian-Spartan victory forced the Persians to retreat from Greece for good."

    "3:15 the Moment of Truth": "The Cobras are the toughest gang around, led by Jeff Hanna (Adam Baldwin) and Cinco (Danny De La Paz). The film opens with the Cobras attacking a rival gang for hanging out on their turf. The rival gang flees and the Cobras turn their attention to a wounded member and proceed to beat him. Jeff tries to intervene but Cinco kills the member. Disgusted, Jeff leaves the gang. Cinco shouts after Jeff, calling him a traitor.\n\nOne year later at Lincoln High. Jeff has cleaned up his act (with the help of the faculty clearing his record) and now plays basketball and dates fellow student Sherry Hallivand (Deborah Foreman). The Cobras practically rule the school, intimidating the students whilst selling drugs to them. Each morning, the Cobras take money from the students then put drugs in their lockers during third period.\n\nThat particular morning, Principal Horner (Rene Auberjonois) has had enough of being unable to control the students and calls Detective Moran (Ed Lauter) to organize a drug bust. During third period, the Cobras begin to distribute drugs when the police arrive and chase them around the school. Several of the gang members get away while others are arrested. Cinco and another member are cornered in the mens' locker room where Jeff happens to be. Cinco tries to hand off the drugs to Jeff but he refuses and Cinco is immediately arrested. Cinco says the drugs are Jeff's and is dragged out, swearing revenge.\n\nRumors begin flying around school, ranging from Jeff narcing on the Cobras to Jeff attacking Cinco. Jeff is unfazed, believing this whole mess to be stupid and simply wants to live his life. In jail, Cinco is furious that Jeff turned him, now his pride is ruined.\n\nAfter basketball practice, Jeff spends the night at Sherry's house. Sherry begs Jeff not to get involved with the Cobras again. Jeff assures her he's not fighting anyone.\n\nThe next day, Jeff is hailed as a hero amongst some students and as a pariah amongst others, particularly the Corbettes, the girlfriends of the Cobras. A few of the Cobras have been released from jail, much to Horner's dismay. Moran explains that the Cobras won't be given a heavy sentence and will soon be released. Horner wants them out of the school, in order to set example. Jeff is called down to the office. The two men try to convince Jeff to testify against Cinco but Jeff refuses. Horner reminds Jeff he cleaned up his record so he could play basketball, so Jeff owes him. Jeff angrily says he doesn't want to be involved and storms out. Horner is determined to get the Cobras out of the school, even if it means they kill Jeff.\n\nIn the hallway, Ponch (Jeb Ellis-Brown), one of the Cobras, calls Jeff a narc and shoots him with a water pistol. Jeff pulls Sherry out of class and tells her that he has a bad feeling about what's going to happen and that he feels unlucky. Sherry assures him he's not. Later, Sherry is intimitated by the Corbettes but is saved by Lora (Wendy Barry), Cinco's girlfriend and Jeff's ex. Lora tells Sherry that she needs to meet with Jeff at a local club to tell him something important about Cinco.\n\nJim (John Scott Clough) and Chris (Scott McGinnis), Jeff's best friends, tell Jeff that the Cobras are planning something. Chris thinks they should attack first but Jim is reluctant. Jeff assures them that the Cobras are all talk.Later in the gym, Jeff is harassed by Smiley (Jesse Aarogon) and two other members. Despite their taunts, Jeff doesn't fight back.\n\nAt lunch, Chris still argues that they should fight back. Norman (Joseph Brutsman), a student who was bullied by the Cobras earlier, agrees. Sherry becomes disgusted and walks away. When Whitey (Bradford Bancroft) harasses her, she slaps him and he grabs her. Suddenly, Jeff leaps onto him and begins to beat him up until Coach Draper (Wayne Crawford) separates them. Sherry runs off and when Jeff catches up to her, she tells him about Lora and that he enjoys this gang stuff. Jeff tries to convince her he never lied to her but she is adament and tells him she never wants to see him again.\n\nIn the bathroom, Jeff confronts Ponch and tells him to give Cinco a message: Is he ready to go to war? In the gym, Coach Draper tells Jeff that Horner has told the D.A. to expect a murder charge and Jeff might be the victim. Despite Draper's assurances, Jeff says he's alone in this matter.\n\nAt the club, Jeff meets up with Lora. Lora offers sex but Jeff refuses. Cinco has gotten Jeff's message and he's going to kill him, along with Sherry. Jeff is disgusted that Cinco wants revenge over something petty. When Lora heads back to the club, she is cornered by the Corbettes who proceed to violently beat her. Jeff calls Sherry and warns her that the Cobras are targeting her and she should stay home from school tomorrow. Sherry ignores his warning and reminds Jeff about his promise.\n\nThe next day, Cinco and the rest of the gang are released from jail. The school announces a half day, saying the grounds will be closed around 3. Jeff is horrified to see that Sherry has come to school. Meanwhile, Chris is antagonized by Smiley who tells him that Cinco wants the fight at school and Jeff will find out the time later. Jeff begs Horner to get Sherry off the grounds but Horner argues that Sherry will be safe in class. His opinion changes however when he recieves a call that Lora has been beaten up and in the hospital. He sends another student to fetch Sherry.\n\nSherry is ambushed in the hallways by the Corbettes and is dragged to the bathroom where she is beaten. Jeff arrives and saves her. As he consoles her, he sees '3:15' spraypainted on the mirror. Sherry is rushed to the hospital and Jeff realizes he has no choice but to face Cinco. Jim and Chris promise to stand by him. Coach Draper tries to convince Horner to remove Jeff from school but Horner ignores him. At the hospital, Jeff reconciles with Sherry.\n\nJeff and the Cobras prepare for the fight. Unbeknownst to Jeff, Cinco has a gun on him. Jeff arrives at the school and discovers Jim and Chris have bailed on him. He tries to get the other cliques to join in but no luck. Seeing he's alone, Jeff goes inside the school while the Cobras break in. Sherry steals her mother's car keys and leaves the hospital. Chooch (Panchito G\u00f3mez) attacks Jeff in the weight room but Jeff easily overpowers him.\n\nThe Cobras corner Jeff in the locker room and incapacitate him. Cinco angrily tells Jeff he betrayed him and now he's going to pay. Suddenly Norman arrives, armed with a baseball bat. When Cinco tries to intimidate him, Norman hits him. Cinco retaliates by shooting him. Jeff quickly disarms the other members as Cinco and Ponch escape into the school. Norman is wounded but still alive. Jeff promises to return with help.\n\nCinco hands Ponch a switchblade and orders him to kill Jeff. Ponch refuses (just like Jeff did last year) and is promptly killed by Cinco. Jeff and Cinco reach a stand off that ends with Cinco shooting Jeff. The cops arrive and Cinco yells from the window that he's won. Jeff slowly crawls up the stairs as Cinco stands over him, gun ready.\n\nSherry appears and pushes Cinco down the stairs. The two former friends wrestle for the gun. Jeff unleashes everything onto Cinco and gets the gun but tosses it aside. When Cinco tries to attack again, he knocks him out. Jeff sighs that it's finally over.\n\nJeff, Sherry and Norman exit the school where Norman is promptly taken to the hospital. Horner pulls Jeff aside and tells him he's glad he won and asks if they can bury the hatchet. Jeff slugs him in response. The film ends with an exhausted Jeff embracing Sherry."

    "4.3.2.1": "The story focuses mainly upon 4 friends, Jo (Emma Roberts), Shannon (Ophelia Lovibond), Kerrys (Shanika-Warren Markland) and Cassandra (Tamsin Egerton). They all meet one other at a Diner, where they also see Dillon (Adam Deacon) and Smoothy (Bashy) getting chased by the police while drug-dealing. As Dillon is running past, he drops a stolen diamond (out of 15) in Cassandra's bag. He is unaware that Shannon has a big crush on Dillon as he always ignores her. The four then walk out and go home.\n\nFirstly, the story focuses upon Shannon: as she walks into her home, she sees that her mother has left for good and her dad is sitting in the living room all alone. She loses her temper, gets a packet of \"Pringles\", two cans of spray-paint and runs away. She then runs over to Joanne's home, who has to rush to work, telling her she does not have time to talk. Later on, she is called over to Jo's work place by Jo; where she is told to leave. When she refuses, Dillon kisses Jo upsetting Shannon, so she grabs a Pringles box from the shop and runs. She is taken in by a woman who saved her from getting raped, but Shannon seems to find that the woman is looking for the Pringles box. This is later confirmed when she finds out that she is searching for \"15 diamonds\". One is already in Cassandra's bag, whilst the rest are in the Pringles can which had fallen out of Shannon's bag earlier. She escapes by knocking the woman out with the bathroom door. She finds the diamonds by going back to the bench where she was almost attacked. Her story ends with her holding the diamonds above a bridge, suggesting she is about to jump and commit suicide.\n\nSecondly, the story moves onto Cassandra, who visits New York to meet up with a man called \"Brett\" she has met on the internet. The meeting ends with her having sex with him. She suddenly feels light headed and falls asleep, and in the morning uses an epipen to pull herself together. She discovers all her possessions gone except for her handbag containing a diamond. She also finds the letter that Shannon has been looking for, which was written by her mother. She later goes to \"Brett's\" house to later find that \"Brett\" is a stalker who hacks into Cassandra's computer taking videos of her. When the fake Brett comes, she knocks him out but later escapes chasing her down the street where she is rescued by a black woman who does not take kindly to racist stereotypical views. She gets her cousins to beat and tattoo the fake Brett with the words chosen by Cassandra. She forces her way into an audition for a new tutor and gets it before then leaving for London.\n\nThirdly the story of Kerrys is explored. Kerrys and her girlfriend break into Cassandra's beachhouse and stay there. Her brother upon discovering them inside, locks them in the panic room and throws a party. While, Dillon and Smoothy visit his house, they ask him to keep the diamonds (now only 14 left) at his house. When the two girls escape from the panic room, they lock her brother in there and run away.\n\nFourthly, Jo, who works at a 24-hour supermarket with Angelo (Jacob Anderson) finds that her new manager (\"Tee\" Noel Clarke) is in town. Tee has been working with Dillon and Smoothy to deliver the diamonds, but one is missing. Tee asks Dillon and Smoothy to come over to the supermarket; Dillon and Smoothy open the safe with the key (which Tee had given to them earlier), they remove the money and drop off the diamonds (which are 14, but Tee thinks there is 15). Dillon and Smoothy come to get the money, when they find Tee has betrayed them, and they rob the store and leave Tee with the 14 diamonds. Tee, however has hidden them in a Pringles box, which is then seen in flashback to show that the box is the very same one that Shannon has. Whilst Tee is about to be shot by the same woman who rescued Shannon earlier, Jo rescues him, but when he tries to run, Angelo attacks him. He is arrested by the police for illegal selling.\n\nCassandra returns with the last diamond and the letter; the three (Cassandra, Jo, and Kerrys) then go to meet Shannon. They put the 14 diamonds together and give it into the police and fly to New York. Whilst on the plane it is revealed that the same mysterious woman who had rescued Shannon is on the plane."

    "48 Hrs.": "Convicted robber Albert Ganz is working as part of a road gang in California, when a big Native American man named Billy Bear drives up in a pickup truck and asks for water to cool off his truck's overheating radiator. Ganz provokes Billy into a fight and when the guards try to break up the fight, Billy slips a gun to Ganz, and both shoot two out of the three guards. Billy is one of Ganz's partners in a gang of thieves and the fight was staged to help Ganz escape. Two days later, Ganz and Billy kill Henry Wong, who was one of their partners, leaving his corpse on a park bench.\n\nLater that same day, alcoholic San Francisco cop Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) joins two of his friends and co-workers -- Detective Algren and Detective VanZant -- at the Walden Hotel to check out a man named G.P. Polson, who is in Room 27. Jack waits downstairs while Algren and VanZant head to Room 27, where it turns out that G.P. Polson is Ganz using a fake name. Ganz immediately kills VanZant, and shoots Algren, while Billy attends to some other business in the room next door to room 27. Jack hears the shots and rushes upstairs, where Algren tells him to go downstairs and find Ganz and Billy. Jack confronts Ganz and Billy downstairs. When Algren makes it downstairs, Ganz takes Jack's gun and uses it to kill Algren, and then Ganz and Billy escape with Jack's gun.\n\nAt the station, Jack is issued a new gun, a Colt .45, and fellow cop Ben Kehoe tells Jack about Ganz's former partner Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy), who is in prison with 6 months to go on a three year sentence for armed robbery. Jack tells his loud and shouting boss, Haden, that he wants to work alone in the search for Ganz, and then visits Reggie at the prison.\n\nThough their first meeting goes badly, with Jack treating Reggie in a fairly racist manner, Jack gets the convict a 48-hour leave from the prison so he can help Jack find Ganz and Billy. Reggie leads Jack to an apartment that Ganz's only other partner, Luther, lives in.\n\nJack and Reggie don't know that a few days ago, Ganz and Billy kidnapped Luther's girlfriend Rosalie. When Jack steps inside Luther's apartment and starts looking around, Luther runs upstairs to the apartment and fires a shot at Jack. Jack chases Luther to Jack's car, where where he left Reggie handcuffed to the steering wheel. Reggie opens the car door on Luther, knocking him down and taking his gun. Jack forces Reggie to give up the pistol and begins interrogating Luther. After getting nothing out of Luther, Jack puts Luther in jail. That night, Reggie leads Jack to Torchy's, a redneck hangout where Billy used to be a bartender.\n\nWith Jack watching and loaning his badge to him, Reggie harasses the customers until the bartender finally tells Reggie where to find Ganz's girlfriend Sally and Billy's girlfriend Casey. The apartment is on top of the Win Sun jewelry store in the Chinatown section of San Francisco. Jack and Reggie visit Casey and Sally, but get nothing out of them, nearly being beaten by them when they're mistaken for intruders.\n\nBack at the car, Jack, who knows Ganz is after something, demands that Reggie tell him what Ganz is after. Because Reggie has refused to tell Jack, Jack starts a fight with Reggie. After the fight, Reggie tells Jack that Ganz and Billy are after $500,000 hidden in the trunk of Reggie's car, which is in a parking garage. Reggie and his partners -- Ganz, Billy, Luther, and Henry -- had robbed a drug dealer of the $500,000 during a bad deal, and Ganz turned and betrayed Reggie.\n\nJack and Reggie drive to the parking garage, parking across the street to watch the entrance. The next morning, Jack and Reggie see Luther, who has been released from jail, going into the parking garage. A few minutes later, Luther emerges with Reggie's car. It seems that Ganz has promised that Rosalie will be safe if Luther gets the money for Ganz. Jack and Reggie chase Luther to a subway station, where Ganz and Billy are waiting. Though Reggie and Jack find them there, Luther still escapes with the money Billy kills another cop with Jack's gun.\n\nThat night, Jack is at his desk at the police station, and Reggie is at Vroman's, a place where people go to dance. When Jack calls Reggie, who answers on a payphone, Reggie tells Jack where he is, and Jack races to Vroman's to talk to Reggie, who is with a woman named Candy.\n\nJack gives Reggie $20 so Reggie can go to the hotel across the street and have sex with Candy. Just as Reggie and Candy get out the front door of Vroman's, Reggie sees Luther board a bus driven by Billy. Reggie races back inside, and tells Jack. Jack and Reggie get in Jack's car, and in the bus, Luther gives Ganz the money, and then Ganz shoots Luther dead.\n\nJack and Reggie then pull up beside the bus and a gunfight breaks out on the street. After Billy forces Jack to crash into a showroom at a car dealership, Haden chews Jack and Reggie out. Jack defends their actions and Reggie, saying he has more heart than most cops do. Later, Jack calls Kehoe, who hasn't heard anything on where Ganz may be.\n\nJack thinks Ganz and Billy may be at Casey and Sally's apartment, so Jack and Reggie head back to the apartment, where Reggie finds Billy, and he shoots Billy dead. Ganz emerges from a room, and opens fire. Reggie and Jack chase Ganz out of the apartment and into a maze of alleys, where Ganz grabs Reggie and puts a gun to Reggie's head.\n\nJack steps into the alley, and fires a shot that kills Ganz, and then when Ganz starts charging towards Jack, Jack fires six more shots, killing Ganz. Later, Jack lets Reggie have sex with Candy at her apartment. Jack shows Reggie his money in his car and tells him, it'll be there waiting for him when he comes out. He then drives away, presumably to take Reggie back to prison."

    "6 Days": "News reports discuss the growth in international terrorism because a willingness to negotiate with terrorists and offer concessions that give terrorist organizations perceived legitimacy. American Special Forces recently made a disastrous attempt to free 52 hostages in Iran. Meanwhile in the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher continues to push controversial economic and social reforms during her first year in office. A banker's holiday approaches in London.\n\nDay 1. On April 30, 1980, six Iranian Arabs from the Democratic Revolutionary Front for the Liberation of Arabistan storm the Iranian Embassy located at 16 Princes Gate, Kensington in London and hold at least 26 hostages inside. The terrorists chain the gates shut. BBC reporter Katie Adie (Abbie Cornish) is stopped by police going to the Iranian Embassy to check on her colleagues who went to the embassy to get visas that day. She witnessed Salim (Ben Turner), the leader of the terrorists inside, stand on a balcony and demand everyone step back and his desire to talk with a negotiator.\n\nAt that time Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin (Jamie Bell) is training with other SAS agents on rescuing hostages when his group leader Roy (Emun Elliott) is paged. The 22 Special Air Service Regiment prepares for action. They are transported to London from Hereford immediately.\n\nMax Vernon (Mark Strong) is the Chief Inspector Metropolitan Police Negotiators Unit. Vernon enters the Montessori Nursery School, seven doors away from the Iranian Embassy. A woman (Marjan Gorgani) is translating the demands from the terrorists. Salim demands the release of 91 Arab prisoners in Iran, or else they will kill a hostage at noon the following day. Deputy Police Commissioner John Dellow (Martin Shaw) and Tom Lovett (Matt Sutherland) greet Vernon. They disclose that PC Trevor Lock (Toby Leach) is among the hostages and perhaps still armed. They show him the standard field telephone used for communication which allows them to listen in on the terrorists within the Embassy if the telephone is not hung up.\n\nThe BBC broadcasts the story of the terrorists on the evening news. They pinpoint the location and decry guns in British streets. Katie Adie is the field reporter on the scene. She eats dinner with her camera man Bill (Martin Hancock) in a car. He tells Katie the terrorists called the BBC to air their demands. Katie wonders what Margaret Thatcher will be willing to concede to the terrorists.\n\nHigh command meets late that night in Cabinet Office Briefing Room A on Whitehall Street with Secretary William Whitelaw (Tim Pigott-Smith) presiding. Whitelaw insists that British law will be followed. Whitelaw learns that the Iranians refuse to release anyone from jail and that Colonel Mike Rose (Robert Portal) of the SAS has quickly drawn up an assault plan that will likely be bloody. Early in the morning, the SAS squad arrives and seeks to avoid the press by going undercover as cleaners. They enter the Royal College of General Practitioners which is located directly next to the embassy.\n\nOn Day 2, Max Vernon readies himself and kisses his wife Betty (Mia Blake) as he leaves home before daylight for a day of negotiations. A radio reports discusses that the police remain in charge of the situation but few details have been disclosed to the general public. The newspaper reports that the Iranians have blamed the West for the situation. The negotiators are frustrated that the terrorists called the BBC and the press is aware of the terrorists demands. There is the belief they cannot be successful negotiating through the press. The SAS team prepares to storm the building just before noon despite a lack of intelligence about the situation they face. The terrorists call the negotiator's desk. The negotiators try to tell the terrorists that Teheran is considering their demands but learn that the terrorists have already called Teheran. The Iranians have told the hostages they are welcomed as martyrs to the great Islamic State of Iran. The SAS establish a mobile command post directly behind the embassy with Major Hector Gullan (Colin Moy) in charge. Gullan has his team at the door fifteen minutes from breaching the embassy.\n\nMax Vernon negotiates with Salim by phone, saying that Max will help him by any means to avoid violence. Max explains that his government has no ability to force the Iranian government to do what is does not want to do. A gunshot is heard. Salim releases one hostage due to illness. The hostage warns the police not to enter the building as the terrorists are \"armed to the teeth.\" The SAS is told to stand down.\n\nMax delivers food to the terrorist at the front door of the embassy. His family is able to watch his actions on television. With Vernon's calm negotiation skills on display, Salim reluctantly agrees to extend the deadline by 48 hours, demanding safe passage to Heathrow Airport on busses accompanied by ambassadors from the Arab League. Reporters say that the polices' soft approach will hopefully lead to a non-violent conclusion.\n\nMeanwhile, the SAS learn that many of the rooms in the embassy have been wired with explosives. Each terrorist possesses at least one fragmenting grenade. Bricks are removed, holes are drilled and microphone listening devices are introduced stealthily into the embassy. The SAS learns that at least some hostages are being held on the second floor. The team strategizes different methods of assault. Rusty Firmin suggests that the start their operation on the roof, enter the building through the top floor windows, secure the hostages inside the stronghold, and fight their way down from there. The team realizes this is the best plan they have.\n\nOn Day 3. Vernon and his assistant review photos of the hostages when Salim calls and reiterates their demands. Gullan devises a new plan where the hostages and terrorists are provided a bus and transported to Heathrow. There the SAS team plans to rescue the hostages from the bus. The team is taken off site to rehearse the assault and discovers great risks to their own personal safety. News reporter Katie Adie notices the team being trucked off the site and reports to the public that the military is in place working alongside the police. While the media reports on the lack of police contact with hostages and speculates on the effectiveness of the negotiation methods employed, the SAS team continues to drill on the bus assault to gain control in less than six seconds.\n\nThen it is decided that no bus will be provided for the terrorists and they will not be transported to Heathrow Airport comparing the failed attempt of the Germans at the Munich Olympics hostage situation. Colonel Rose points out that the SAS team has never operated on English soil and that the job asked of them to perform a rescue in a stronghold is fraught with risk.\n\nMeanwhile the Arab League has agreed to help with negotiations but the Prime Minister insists that the United Kingdom will not be seen as a soft target for terrorists. British law will be upheld and the terrorists will never leave the country. Max believes they must offer the terrorists something tangible in hopes the terrorists feel they have achieved something and give up.\n\nMembers of the SAS team climb onto the roof of the embassy to further plan their assault. They see the\n\nhostages through the skylight. The passage allows for a perfect opportunity for a distraction charge that Roy will deliver. Roy promotes Rusty to be the leader of the team and gives him the mission codes.\n\nRose describes a plan to the political leadership where the SAS team enters through the skylight under the cover of darkness and neutralizes the terrorists as they sleep. The politicians are aghast that the SAS will be labeled an assassination squad. Though Whitelaw agrees to take the plan to the Prime Minister, he believes it will ultimately be up to the negotiators to break the deadlock or else the SAS will have to storm the building.\n\nOn Day 4, outside BBC report Katie Adie debates with press writer Jimmy (Tim Downie) whether the army will attack the building. Inside, a dispute arises amongst the terrorists. Faisal (Aymen Hamdouchi) wants the prove their resolve. Salim agrees that they will kill a hostage if their demands are not met that day.\n\nMax learns that the Arab League refuses to be part of the negotiation if the terrorists are not allowed safe passage out of the UK, something the British government will never allow. Roy gets Firmin's promotion to team leadership approve by Gullan. Salim calls again, demanding to speak with the ambassadors. Max stalls for time saying it is difficult to organize their participation. Salim demands the army stop prowling on their roof and walls. The sounds outside disappear. Salim then demands to speak to the BBC, and Max reluctantly agrees, but urges Salim to release another hostage. Salim tells Max how his people are tortured and oppressed by the Persians. Afterwards, Salim releases another hostage. The hostage tells Gullan that the terrorists are making plans to kill all the hostages if their demands are not met.\n\nMeanwhile the press portrays hope for a peaceful ending. The political leadership approve the immediate implementation of the SAS deliberate action plan as soon as there is proof of murder.\n\nOn Day 5, the SAS practices their assault on the embassy on a mock-up of the floorplan constructed in a barracks. The caretaker (Ajay Vasisht) of the embassy building is invited to the site and points out their errors in the floorplan reproduction. The Prime Minister and the Arab League remain at loggerheads limiting the League's participation. The Iraqis offer to help but British intelligence learns Sami Mohammed Ali, an Iraqi operative, likely smuggled the weapons into the United Kingdom in diplomatic bags. One day prior to the attack, Ali fled the country.\n\nSalim calls Vernon again. Vernon assures Salim that his demands will be read out in full on the BBC at 6:00 p.m. that evening. Salim says failure to follow through will lead to one hostage being killed every half hour. Inside, Trevor Lock tells the BBC reporter Sim Harris (Sam Snedden) who also being held that he feels like an animal being readied for slaughter and is considering his options in using his weapon.\n\nAs 6:00 p.m. approaches, the SAS team moves into place. The local BBC News only delivers a headline regarding the terrorists' demand for an airplane to leave the country. The phone rings and Max hesitantly answers it. To his surprise, Salim thanks him for his efforts and offers to release two hostages. Only then does Max learn that the BBC World Service has broadcast the terrorists' statement in full, giving the reason for their actions as the oppression by the Iranian government in Arabistan.\n\nKatie Abie reports that two hostages were released. The SAS team stands down. Back in their quarters, Firmin suggests that the SAS team missed their chance to free the hostages but implies the challenge still lies ahead of them.\n\nOn Day 6, Faisal Jaseem berates an Iranian hostage of his leader's responsibility for murdering. his people. Faisal threatens to make an example of him. Katie Adie reports that Radio Teheran is reporting that an assault is imminent though British spokesmen say negotiations are ongoing. PC Trevor Lock is separated from the other hostages. Firmin spends his time studying the faces of the terrorists and the hostages learning who should not be shot. He compares his own background to that of Faisal stating he believes if Faisal is backed into a corner, he will fight his way out with nothing to lose. Lock places a call to Vernon and tells him that a hostage is tied up downstairs and believes the terrorists will kill him if their demands are not met.\n\nSalim grabs the phone and demands a bus and the ambassadors to take them to the airport immediately. Faisal has tired of all the talking and blames the Iranian leader Khomeini for killing his countrymen. The hostage says that he welcomes his own death if it leads to Faisal's death. Despite Salim's pleas, Faisal shoots the hostage in the head three times. The SAS team get word from Hector Gullan that shots have been fired in the embassy. Max asks Salim if a hostage was killed. Salim responds that they have 30 minutes to meet the terrorists demands or more hostages will be killed and tells Max they can collect the body. Firmin suggests that the negotiators have Salim on the telephone to give the assault team the maximum amount of time to breech the building.\n\nWith that, Home Secretary Whitelaw authorizes the SAS operation and control of the operation is signed over to the regiment. The Prime Minister instructs Colonel Rose that no blockage or smokescreen should be created to block the television cameras so that the world and British people can see how the British government deals with terrorists. Vernon is instructed to do anything to stall or distract the terrorists from the assault.\n\nVernon calls Salim to discuss buses with Salim while Roy lowers the distraction charge down the light tube. Salim knows Vernon is lying. The press sees movement of SAS team on the roof and around the building. Roy reports the distraction charge is in place. Salim tells Vernon that the bus must have curtains and that Max must drive the bus. He then hands off the phone to Lock. Lock tells max he finds it unbelievable that the government is giving in to the demands of the hostages. Max tells Lock he has his demands from the government.\n\nMeanwhile, SAS agents have lowered themselves on ropes to enter the upper story through the windows and race ladders to their placement on the ground. An agent puts his foot through a window causing Salim to become suspicious and leave the telephone. The distraction charge is exploded. The press and police race for cover.\n\nFirmin's team places explosives on the front balcony to gain entrance. Firmin has to improvise when one agent gets hung up in the ropes and a selected placement of an explosive would kill the man. The SAS enter the building. Sim Harris is among the first hostages to escape. The team begins working their way through the building clearing stairwells and rooms. Four female hostages are found and sent down the stairs. A blocked door requires Firmin to find an alternate entry into a room. He returns to the balcony and enters through an exterior window. He encounters a terrorist who shoots at him. Trevor Lock is found wrestling with Salim over his gun when agents break into the room and exterminate Salim. The SAS team comes upon a room full of hostages and kill three of the terrorists. While the hostages are being hustled outside, Firmin recognizes Faisal hiding among them and shoots him in the stomach before Faisal can detonate a grenade. Outside the Embassy, the hostages are detained and searched, revealing the sixth and last terrorist trying to hide among them, and he is arrested.\n\nDuring the assault, led by Firmin, Salim and four of the other terrorists are killed, at the cost of one of the hostages and none of the SAS men. Firmin's gun and the grenade he claimed from Faisal are bragged as evidence for the inquiry. A visibly shaken Vernon telephones his wife to reassure her that he is safe. The SAS team rides back to Hereford, hearing the Prime Minister's effusive praise of them and the Metropolitan Police on the radio."

Neodymium are micro magnets which One can control using electronic devices and turn into a weapon. One realized that the Governments don't help people who need it, and his billions were not going to be enough. So, he decided to solve the root of the problem by himself.\n\nNow known as \"One\" (Ryan Reynolds), he recruits five other people to abandon their pasts and join his cause as \"Ghosts\": Two (Melanie Laurent) (Camille), a spy; Three (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) (Javier), a hit-man (he was a Colombian assassin working for the drug mafia); Four (Ben Hardy) (Billy), a Parkour runner and thief (One met him after he had stolen a really expensive diamond set & was betrayed by his partners after the robbery and left for dead); Five (Adria Arjona) (Amelia), a doctor; and Six (Dave Franco), a driver. One stores all their past records inside the hulk of an abandoned plane in the California desert, which is also their base of operations.\n\nOne establishes a set of ground rules such as not sharing names. Leave the laggards behind.\n\nOn their first mission in Florence, Italy, the team kills the lawyer of Turgistan's four generals before they are chased across the city by the Mafia and the police. The lawyer was covering for the ruler and his 4 generals by denying that any atrocities took place on their watch. Six (the driver) is killed just as they manage to get away. The getaway leaves a trail of mayhem and destruction through the entire city. The team works together as a single unit to get out of numerous tight situations, even though each member on their team has their own stress and pressure points.\n\nDays later, One recruits former Delta Force sniper Blaine and renames him \"Seven\" (Corey Hawkins). Blaine had correctly spotted a terrorist van disguised as a UN vehicle in Afghanistan (The UN was spelled backwards on top of the van) but failed to report it on time which led to the death of his entire squad when it blew up. One tells Seven that this is his chance to do some good in the world by fighting some world class evil people. As the rest, Blaine fakes his own death to turn into a Ghost.\n\nOne plans a mission to stage a coup to topple the government of Turgistan dictator Rovach Alimov (Lior Raz) and install his imprisoned brother Murat (Peyman Maadi) as the country's new leader during the Day of the Dead. As an ad distributor in Turgistan, Rovach's war on his people created a million refugees, many of whom sought shelter in camps on the Turgistan border. One was visiting one of the refugee camps as part of a PR tour. He just wanted to cut the check, click a few PR photos and be on his way. One had seen first-hand Rovach bomb his own population with phosphorous bombs, which burnt their bodies from the inside. One only managed to survive as he got to a mask in time. In minutes, a refugee camp with 80,000 people was reduced to a rubble. From that day on, One cared to bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\nThrough the mission in Italy, the team gets their hands on the lawyer's phone, which they unlock through his eyeball, and gain access to all secure communications and travel plans of Rovach's generals. They learn that Rovach is sending them to Las Vegas for an arms deal.\n\nThe team assassinates Rovach's generals in Las Vegas, but the generals have already made the deal for 2 tons of Sarin gas. One gets the information on where Rovach has hidden his brother Murt (who was delivered to him by the CIA, specifically by Two). Rovach had hidden Murat in Hong Kong. Murat tells Rovach that the throne belongs to the people, and his atrocities will only make Murat more popular with the people.\n\nThe team successfully extract Murat from the Ni Hai tower in Hong Kong. When Four is cornered by hit-men during Murat's release, Seven insists to save him (as he does not want one more death on his hands that he can avoid). Seven forces One to abandon his rule of leaving the laggards behind. Seven comes from Delta forces, who never leave one of theirs behind in a war zone.\n\nFollowing an argument between One and Seven, the Ghosts break their code of anonymity and reveal each other's names. One also learns that Two and Three are having sex with each other.\n\nIn Turgistan, One sets his plan in motion by hacking the state-run television station during Rovach's address to give Murat a voice to the people. Murat's impromptu speech inspires the citizens to revolt while strategic explosions in the city force Rovach to evacuate to his private yacht and Murat occupies the palace. The Ghosts storm through the yacht and One activates a magnetic pulse to incapacitate the guards. When the yacht is immobilized in the middle of the ocean, Rovach flees in helicopter, only to discover it to be commandeered by the Murat and the Ghosts, who drop him near the border to feed him to the refugees.\n\nIn the aftermath of the revolution, Murat becomes Turgistan's new president and the Ghosts part ways until they are once again needed. One travels to New York City and sees his illegitimate son, whom he will pass his fortunes should he die in the next mission."

    "6-Headed Shark Attack": "In a marriage boot camp on an island, William Nix (Brandon Auret) is counseling a group of couples through various physical challenges to make them more cooperative with each other. William's wife Suzanne (Caitlin Harty) arrives on a boat so he can sign some divorce papers, leaving the couples to swim to a small dock in the water as part of a challenge. Meanwhile, William's assistants Brad and Rebecca are eaten by a 6-headed shark while swimming in the water. William goes back onto the island to meet up with the couples, leaving Suzanne on her boat with her captain. On his way, William discovers Brad's severed foot, and goes to warn the couples.\n\nThe couples, consisting of Mary and James, Daphne and Duke, Jake and Sarah, and Kip and Angie, swim out to the dock, only to discover the severed foot. William arrives immediately after, and the group uses the dock to get to a the Sweet Waters, a boat that Brad and Rebecca came in on. They fail send out the mayday signal, and William, and Duke swim back onto the island in order to find Rebecca, not knowing that she's dead. William and Duke are soon attacked by the shark, although Duke seemingly kills it. However, the shark soon revives and eats Duke. When Williams swims back to the boat it runs aground, preventing it from going anywhere.\n\nWith no other options left, the survivors swim back to the island, only to discover that a storm's approaching the island. Knowing that the storm will flood the island, the survivors swims to an abandoned research facility on a series of floating docks next to the island, only to discover blood all over the walls in a room with a small fishing hole in the middle of it, indicating an attack took place there. William attempts to contact help with a radio in the facility, although to no avail. The shark soon enters through the hole and eats Sarah, and Jake. William has the others escape while he stays behind to fight the shark.\n\nWith the others safe at shore, William manages to contact Suzanne through the radio, and explains their situation to her. She agrees to rescue them at a nearby lighthouse on the island. As William begins to swim back to the island, the shark begins walking on the island using four of its heads as leverage, and kills and eats both Kip and Angie. William arrives with a machete and decapitates one of the shark's heads, causing it to back off, although it later grows back the decapitated head. The remaining four survivors, William, Mary, James and Daphne, reach the lighthouse. A delirious Daphne walks off onto the shoreline alone, where the shark eats her.\n\nThe shark attacks Suzanne's boat, and eats the captain. Suzanne attempts to swim to shore but she too gets eaten, devastating William. William, Mary, and James then make an attempt to kill the shark by setting up several air tanks on the beach, with James shooting them from the top of the lighthouse when the shark arrives. The shark soon arrives, and James shoots, and kills one of the heads, only for one of the other heads to rip off the dead head, and use it as a projectile to kill James. The shark retreats back into the water while William and Mary find that the Sweet Waters is now free from the rocks.\n\nWilliam and Mary set up the air tanks on the Sweet Waters, hoping to blow it up, and kill the shark. However, although William manages to kill one of the shark heads, the plan fails, and he and Mary are forced to swim back onto the island with the boat sinking. The shark, which has all six of its heads back, follows them, although William lures it next to some of the tanks left on the shore line, and shoots them with a flare gun, killing the shark. William and Mary, the only survivors of the massacre, begin walking to safety as the decapitated shark heads attempt to bite each other."

    "65": "65 million years ago, on the planet Somaris, pilot Mills (Adam Driver) convinces his wife Alya (Nika King) that he should take on a two-year space expedition to earn the money needed to treat their daughter Nevine's (Chloe Coleman) illness. Mills will earn thrice his normal salary for this expedition. During the journey, his spaceship, the Zoic, is hit by a mass of asteroids and crash-lands on an alien planet, which unbeknownst to him, is actually Earth. All the passengers were in a Cryogenic induced sleep and Mills was the only being awake as the pilot of the ship.\n\nWith his ship damaged beyond repair, he finds that his passengers have been killed and contemplates suicide until he finds a lone survivor, a young girl named Koa (Ariana Greenblatt). Mills sends a distress beacon for rescue and decides to take care of Koa. However, they have difficulty communicating due to differing languages and a broken translator. Mills surveys the area surrounding the ship and finds skeletons of dinosaurs and steam jet geysers.\n\nMills later discovers a functioning escape shuttle from the Zoic has landed on top of a mountain, 15 kilometers away. To encourage Koa to follow him, Mills lies about her family being atop the mountain, when in reality they perished in the crash. The pair quickly realize the planet is home to dangerous and aggressive alien creatures, which turn out to be Earth's dinosaurs. As Mills protects Koa, they begin to bond. Mills has a device that tells them what is safe to eat. Mills finds some poison berries that he stops Koa from eating.\n\nKoa watches several video messages sent by Nevine. The two are attacked by an unidentified monster, which Mills manages to wound before hiding in a cave. An insect gets into Koa's mouth and starts to suffocate her, but Mills finds it in time and extracts the insect. They are pushed deeper into the cave by a T-Rex who attacks them from outside the cave. Mills manages to injure the creature with his gun. Mills hands a few bombs to Koa, just in case she finds herself alone.\n\nThey enter a narrow shaft to escape the cave. After a rockfall inside the narrow shaft separates them, Mills is trapped inside the cave, while Koa falls outside the cave system into the open jungle. Koa finds a large dinosaur tooth lying in the jungle, which is also very sharp. She laces the tooth with a paste from the poison berries. Mills is attacked by an Oviraptor and Koa is attacked by a raptor-like creature which she traps in a fallen tree log; she uses bombs Mills had given her to kill the dinosaur.\n\nMills kills the Oviraptor with his gun and escapes the cave, however he falls into quicksand while searching for Koa. Koa rescues him and they continue up the mountain. However, Mills discovers that a huge asteroid, the same one whose debris his ship crashed into, will strike Earth in less than 12 hours.\n\nThe two reach the escape shuttle, but Koa is angry when she discovers that Mills lied to her. Mills opens up to Koa about losing Nevine, who had died of her illness while he was away, and promises to protect her. Upon learning rescue is on the way, the two board the escape shuttle, but the asteroid's debris causes it to fall down the mountain. The shuttle cannot launch as it is in the wrong position and facing upside down.\n\nMills and Koa manage to fend off a pair of Tyrannosaurus Rex. Mills goes outside the shuttle as he finds a gun lying on the ground, but the gun wont charge and he has to hide inside the shell of his ship. Koa lures the T-Rexes away from Mills using a projection of Nevine from one of her videos. Mills uses the distraction to shoot down one of the T-Rex, but the other understands the ruse and attacks Koa. Mills charges his gun and shoots the T-Rex dead and saves Koa.\n\nBut the same creature they injured earlier at the cave, which turns out to be an enormous quadrupedal Theropod, also attacks. Mills asks Koa to launch the ship, and runs away. Mills manages to lure it toward a large geyser while Koa stabs it in the eye with a large dinosaur tooth that she coated in poison berries earlier. The pair escapes just in time as the asteroid strikes Earth, causing a cataclysmic event and the extinction of the dinosaurs. With the pod set to meet up with a rescue vessel, the two relax and fly off into the stars.\n\nIn closing titles, the evolution of Earth is shown, at the spot where Mills and Koa left, through an ice age until the present day."

    "7Aum Arivu": "The film depicts the fictional life of Bodhidharma (Suriya), a master of martial arts and medical remedies, who is depicted in the film as the son of a great Tamil king of the Pallava Dynasty. He is sent to China by his guru, who requests him to stop the spread of a pandemic disease existing there from spreading to India. Initially the people in China treated him as an inferior but later when he cures a little girl from the deadly disease and fights against some people who ill treated villagers there, the people of China began to respect and worship him. He begins to teach them how to cure many diseases, the skills of hypnotism and the physical training of the Shaolin monks that led to the creation of Shaolinquan. However after several years, when he expresses his desire to return to India, the villagers plot to poison him and bury him near the temple, believing that their place would be disease free if he is buried there. Bodhidharma agrees to die and subsequently becomes a fundamental figure in Chinese history, affectionately being dubbed as \"Damo\". The film switches to modern-day China, where Dong Lee (Johnny Tri Nguyen) is given the task of starting a government planned biological war against India, known as Operation Red. Dong Lee arrives in Chennai starts this operation by injecting a virus into a street dog. This disease was the one which occurred during the time of Bodhidharma in China. Meanwhile Subha Srinivasan (Shruti Haasan), a student of genetics researches that Bodhidharma can be brought back to life if his sample of DNA is matched with another sample of DNA which she finds in Aravind (Suriya) a descendant of Bodhidharma who is working as a circus artist nearby. Dong Lee finds out Subha's mission to revive Bodhidharma and plans to kill her first, so that the disease cannot be stopped. Subha approaches Aravind to start the mission, but gets romantically involved in him and forgets her duty. One day, Aravind's family see Subha and clearly remember that she visited them a year before to find Aravind and know all about him for the Bodhidharma research. Saving herself, she lies by saying that she doesn't know them. Later that night, Aravind's uncle (Ilavarasu) explains all what happened one year before when they met Subha. Aravind goes and meets Subha, and is enraged upon realising the truth. However the next day, he reconciles with Subha and agrees to contribute to the research and hence save the country. The research begins of giving life to Bodhidharma and to end Operation Red. But Dong Lee, who is capable of doing anything, does all impossibly bad things, mastered in \"Nokku Varmam\" (hypnotism), a martial art which was actually taught to the Chinese by Bodhidharma. Subha goes to her genetics department and announces that Operation Red can be stopped if they read and make use of the cures in a book written by Bodhidharma. However, the department laughs and refuses to believe her, claiming that an ancient book is of no use in modern times. Disappointed, Subha leaves. After some time, Subha and Aravind find out that Subha's professor from the genetics department is assisting Dong Lee in Operation Red. They sneak into the professor's apartment and learn about the operation, without his knowledge. The next day, the professor is caught red-handed by Aravind, Subha and her friends, but surrenders and explains that he received a huge sum of money from the China government if he carried out Operation Red. After the professor gives the gang more details about Operation Red and how to stop it, they leave. However, after a while, Dong Lee arrives and the professor once again teams up with him to save his own life. Dong Lee causes numerous havoc in the city, which Subha, Aravind and their gang barely escape. They finally locate a research centre where they can activate Bodhidharma DNA in Aravind, and decide to hide there for a few days. They all deactivate their phones so that no-one can trace them. But Dong Lee somehow traces Subha and the gang with the help of two of Subha's outside friends. However, he kills both of them afterwards. Dong Lee then locates the place of the research centre. Subha and her friends in the research centre escape in a van, but Dong Lee chases them and the van collapses. An unconscious Aravind gets beaten badly by Dong Lee at first, but then manages to regain Bodhidharma skills somehow (in spite of the sun-rays hitting him on his face which was not supposed to happen and a day before he was estimated to regain his skills). Aravind wakes up with Bodhidharma's talent and in a final fight, defeats Dong Lee. Afterwards, Aravind and Subha manage to eradicate the virus spreading. The film ends with them giving a lecture via the media, about the need to remember important histories and to teach all practices in the name of science and not god."

    "9": "The movie opens with the Scientist (Alan Oppenheimer) making a sentient ragdoll on whose back he writes '9'. Outside, the world lies in ruins; the result of a catastrophic war caused by mankind's dependence on machines. Some time later, when all is silent, the ragdoll 9 comes to life. Looking around, he sees that the room he is in, 'The First Room', is a complete mess and devoid of life. He opens a window and sees the entire city before him in ruins, the sky dark and cast over. He tries to say something but nothing happens. He can't speak.\n\nWith little trepidation, he walks through the desolate and deserted city. He comes upon a car in the road and, looking inside, sees a mother and her child lying dead within. As he recoils from the sight, he hears a sound and sees a slowly approaching light. 9 hides behind some rubble, picks up a metal bar, and waits. As the light comes closer, 9 swings the bar and it connects with a creature that closely resembles him. But the other ragdoll appears older and is differently crafted, wearing a magnifying glass in front of his eyes and fitted with a lit candle on his headgear. The ragdoll, 2 (Martin Landau), gasps at the sight of 9, who starts to run away until 2 cries out, \"Wait! I'm a friend!\"\n\n9 stops and returns to help 2 from the ground, who then gives 9 an appraising look and marvels at his detail and design. When he sees that 9 can't talk, 2 instructs him to follow. They walk over to a discarded doll at the side of the road and 2 begins to fumble inside it. In the meantime, 9 picks up a bullet from the ground and begins playing with it, unaware of what it is. 2 manages to find the doll's voicebox and stops 9 before he can cause damage with the bullet, telling him that some things are better left alone. 2 then inserts the voicebox into 9's chest cavity through his zipper. After some adjustments, 9 (Elijah Wood) finally speaks and says, \"Friend\".\n\n2 then notices something inside 9 and pulls it out. The small, hemispherical device with three symbols on it is revealed to be 'The Talisman'. 2 says to himself, \"He's always drawing this\". A loud sound echoes nearby and 2 suddenly becomes afraid. He instructs 9 to hide inside a nearby broken can while he stands guard, armed with a spear, waiting tensely. A large 'Beast' appears and attacks 2. When it notices the Talisman, the Beast snatches it and turns its attention to 9. With its claws inches from 9's face, 2 tries to distract the Beast. The Beast turns and swallows 2, allowing 9 to find another hiding spot and evade capture. Unable to find 9, the Beast departs. Slightly damaged, his arm torn, and shaken from the attack, 9 faints. His unconscious form is soon spotted by a one-eyed ragdoll named '5' (John C. Reilly).\n\nWhen 9 awakens, he sees that 5 is tending to him and that his arm has been fixed. Within their hideout, 5 tells him that 2 is usually better at fixing them, unaware of 2's fate. At that moment, an elderly and domineering ragdoll called 1 (Christopher Plummer) enters. He looks at 9 and angrily berates 5 for almost leading the Beast to them. A larger ragdoll named 8 (Fred Tatasciore) enters and appears to be 1's bodyguard.\n\n1 orders them to all go to the upper level of the building, which they travel to in a pulley-drawn bucket. Once there, 9 discovers that they're inside a half-destroyed church: Notre Dame. The remnants of a fighter plane lays within part of the church. 1 narrates the 'story' as he knows it. When he first awoke, he saw that there was a war between man and machine. As the ragdolls ran for their lives, 5 lost his left eye and was saved by 2. While they remained hidden, the machines proved victorious over man and deployed poisonous gas bombs that killed off all life on Earth. All that remained was the ruins, the ragdolls, and the Beasts.\n\n1 tells 9 that all the ragdolls that were created, 3, 4, 7, and now 2, have been lost except for them. He orders 5 and 9 to go to the watchtower while, in another room, 6 (Crispin Glover) repeatedly draws the image of the Talisman on paper with his pen-like fingers, appearing to be the one 2 was referring to. On the watchtower, 5 and 9 look through a telescope and see a large factory in the distance. 5 tells 9 that the factory is where the Beast would have taken 2, but is reluctant to rescue him despite 9's insistence. When 9 argues that 2 would have tried to save them, 5 relents and procures a map that they can use to get there.\n\nAs they walk, they discover 2's candle headpiece and 5 wonders why he was out there all alone. They search for a tunnel that will lead to their destination as a sandstorm rolls in and blows the map away. 5 and 9 continue, knowing they can't go back now. When the sandstorm dies down, they notice a large footprint on the ground that they recognize as the Beast's. Needing light, they take a small lightbulb from the headlight of a wrecked car and 9 fashions a torch-staff with it. 5 sadly notes that clever 2 was just as likely to have thought of something like that.\n\nIn the distance, the shadow of a creature with a beak finds 5's map.\n\n5 and 9 finally arrive at the factory and find that it's a dark and imposing place. 9 turns off his light to prevent unwanted attention as they go inside. Eventually, they see a cage and discover 2 inside it. At first he is unresponsive, but slowly wakes and is happy that they've come for him. When they hear sounds nearby, 9 takes a look and sees the Beast trying to insert the Talisman into a socket of some kind. Suddenly, the Beast sees 9 and lunges to attack. At that moment, the beaked creature appears and beheads the Beast. When it removes its beaked headdress, the creature is revealed to be another ragdoll named 7 (Jennifer Connelly). 2 and 5 are ecstatic to see her, having given her up for dead, and introduce her to 9. In the midst of their happy reunion, 9 picks up the Talisman and unwittingly inserts it into the socket. 2 notices too late and tries to stop 9, but the factory comes alive. A bright light shoots out of the central machine and strikes 2 in the eyes and mouth and drains his life force. His lifeless body falls to the ground in a heap.\n\nWith no time to mourn 2, 5, 7, and 9 run from the awakened Machine, a large spherical creature with a bright red light at its core and limb-like electrodes protruding from it. The ragdolls' escape is blocked by a chasm but 7 notices a lever overhead and uses 5's grappling gun to shoot a hook around the switch. 7 and 9 grab 5 and swing towards a conveyor belt on the other side. However, their collective weight throws the switch and the resulting jerk causes 7 to lose her grip. 5 and 9 fall onto the conveyor belt while 7 manages to grab a ledge. Activated by the switch, the conveyor belt starts to move and 5 and 9 are forced to dodge many large metallic objects. They fall to the floor below as the Machine moves menacingly towards 7, sparking its electrodes. 5 and 9 distract it with their torch-staff and the Machine gives chase. 5 and 9 are able to hide from view for a few moments and reunite with 7 in the tunnel. The Machine chases them inside but proves too large to fit in the tunnel. The ragdolls escape.\n\nOutside the factory, 5 is devastated by 2's death, and 7 is furious at 9 for causing the chaos. However, she knows where to find answers and tells them to follow her.\n\nMeanwhile, the Machine uses materials around it to create a new monster.\n\n5, 7, and 9 go to a library with a large courtyard filled with statues. The ragdolls look at old paintings on the walls and see books scattered all over the place. 7 calls, and small, twin ragdolls with hoods appear: 3 and 4. Despite being mute, their eyes project video memories. As they look over 9, their eyes flash and analyze him with curiosity. 7 asks them for help, saying that they've awakened something terrible. 9 guiltily corrects her, saying that 'he' woke the creature and the twins project a video on a book describing 'The Machine'. As it turns out, the Machine was created by the very same Scientist who created them. Under orders from a dictatorial Chancellor (Tom Kane), the Scientist commissioned the Machine and dubbed it the 'Brain'; a device that has the ability to create its own machines. The Chancellor used it to turn the tide of his war but it soon turned against mankind and destroyed the world. For some reason, it fell inactive afterwards, only to be reawakened by 9.\n\nEager to know more about the Talisman that woke the Brain, 9 draws the three shapes that were inscribed on it. 5 says that 6 draws those very shapes and 9 requests to see him. 7, however, refuses to return to the church, explaining that she doesn't like 1 very much before running off.\n\nUnabashed, 5 and 9 return to the church to see 6 but are grabbed by 8. 1 enters the room, furious, and accuses them of dooming them all. 9 asks him who sent 2 out into the world alone and 1 doesn't deny it. 6 enters and sees the shapes drawn by 9. He says that the shapes are the 'Source' but, before 9 can ask more, 1 orders them all locked up. 9 calls 1 a coward but 1 angrily retorts that he'll do what it takes to keep them safe.\n\nAt that moment, the church is attacked by the Brain's newly created Beast, a creature that resembles a pterodactyl, with wings and a long beak. The ragdolls flee for their lives as the Beast's attack lights the church on fire, and they wind up on one of the wings of the crashed fighter plane. Cornered, 7 enters and tries to attack the Beast from behind but it turns and swats her away. She tries again but the Beast shoots a cabled harpoon into her leg and begins to reel her in. 9 grabs her and uses her spear to stab the Beast's wing, halting their movement. 8 arrives and cuts the taut cable which slingshots away and wraps around the fighter plane's wing propeller, causing the wing to start sliding downwards. 8 grabs a groove in the wing while 7 and 9 hold on, but 1 loses his balance and his staff. 9 grabs the staff and holds it out to 1 who grabs it. 5 and 6 land inside the propeller mechanism and turn the propeller on. The spinning propeller pulls the Beast towards it but, with a burst of strength and speed, the Beast leaps away and lands inches from 1, taking his cape in its beak. 9 yells at 1 to remove his cape. Reluctantly, 1 listens and releases it, sending the Beast snapping backwards and into the propeller where it's torn apart and destroyed.\n\nThanks to the fire, however, the ragdolls are now homeless and they leave the church as it burns. 1 watches sadly as their 'sanctuary' smolders. They all go to the library to live with 3 and 4.\n\nMeanwhile, a drone takes the remnants of the Beast back to the Brain. It becomes angry until it focuses on 2's body and appears to hatch an idea.\n\nAt the library, 8 is appointed as the lookout. It's quiet outside so he takes the opportunity to use a magnet on his head to get some sort of high. While 3, 4, 6, and 9 go over the symbol drawings, 1 becomes upset about what he terms \"dark science\". 9 accuses him of sending 2 out to scout purposely to kill him off. Indignant, 1 says that 2 was sacrificed because he was old and weak. Furious, 7 jumps on him and puts a knife to his throat. 9 talks her down and she walks off angrily. 1 leaves as well. Short on answers, 9 decides to go to the First Room where he was created. Outside, 8 hears something and looks around. He walks tensely through the courtyard and suddenly sees 2 rise up in the air, his eyes flashing like a strobe light. 8 becomes hypnotized.\n\nIn a separate room, 1 walks alone in a huff before he becomes startled by a sound. His fear increases when he sees 2 floating eerily towards him. Like 8, 1 becomes hypnotized by 2's flashing eyes. It's revealed that 2's body is actually being used as a puppet by a snakelike Beast, the head of which opens up to reveal a one-eyed skull. The serpentine body, covered in fabric with jointed legs attached to it, picks 1 up and begins to tie him in thread. Already stuffed inside the Snake, 8 lies still. As 1 is reeled in, 5 and 9 rush out to his rescue. The Snake uses 2 again in an attempt to hypnotize them as well but 9 averts his eyes. 5, however, becomes entranced and is rooted to the spot. Just then, 7's spear hits 2 and embeds him in a wall nearby, stopping the hypnotic flashing. 7 runs towards 2's body, dodging the Snake's attacks and retrieves her spear before cutting the Snake's tail from 2's form. The Snake grabs hold of her and 5 suddenly snaps out of his trance. He shoots the Snake in its one eye, causing it to retreat and slither away with 7 and 8. 7 screams out to 9 but the Snake escapes.\n\n1 is safe but 9 tells him that the Snake has taken 7 and 8. 9 proposes that they rescue them but 1 refuses. Still, 9 manages to persuade him. They perform funerary rites for 2 and fit him on a raft with coins over his eyes, letting him float freely into the sewers before they head off towards the factory. With his torch-staff, 9 goes inside alone. He tells 5 that if he doesn't return, 5 is to destroy the factory.\n\nInside, 9 watches as the Snake hands 8 over to the Brain. 8's life force is drained into the Brain, making it more powerful. As the Snake reaches for 7, 9 ties a threat around a bolt and tosses it over a ledge between a pair of moving cogs. He is able to distract the Snake which places 7 back inside itself as it goes after 9. Through its one broken eye, it lunges at what it thinks is a ragdoll and begins tying it up. The 'doll' is actually a piece of burlap fabric wrapped around the torch-staff. When the Snake inadvertently turns the light on the staff on, it recoils from the light. 9 then burst out of his hiding place and runs with a knife in his mouth. Finally seeing him, the Snake gives chase. The dummy ragdoll, tied to the cabled bolt, is pulled along by the Snake until the cable is caught in the moving cogs, yanking the Snake back. At that, 9 turns around and runs up to the Snake, pulled upward by the cable. 9 uses his knife to slash open the Snake's fabric body, freeing 7. The Snake is pulled up and into the cogs where its head is crushed.\n\nOutside, 1 and 5 prepare to push a barrel full of fuel inside the tunnel. 1 is all for getting it done immediately, but 5 wants to wait for 7 and 9. They are then noticed by a recon drone. Using 5's grappling gun, they rope it and start to pull it down.\n\nInside, 7 and 9 are spotted by the Brain which sends mechanical spiders after them. 7 and 9 sprint into the tunnel and yell for the ragdolls outside to send in the barrel. 1 and 5 light the fuse and push the barrel into the tunnel. It is immediately followed by the drone which they have tied to the barrel. As the barrel and drone roll down the tunnel, 7 and 9 dodge it before escaping just in time; the barrel knocks back all of the mechanical spiders and falls into the factory where the Brain can only watch helplessly before it explodes. The factory erupts in flames as the ragdolls escape.\n\nThe ecstatic ragdolls start to celebrate and 3 and 4 put on a record player, though 1 feels a bit downcast. As 5 chases a runaway LP record he notices, to his horror, that the Brain is still alive. Mobile, it chases him up the hill. 9 tries to run to 5's rescue but 1 suddenly restrains him. The Brain grabs 5 and drains his life force, regaining its strength.\n\nThe ragdolls run towards a rickety bridge with the Brain in close pursuit. 6 then notices that the ragdolls absorbed by the Brain have actually had their souls trapped inside of it. While they are able to run easily across the bridge, the Brain proves too heavy and the bridge gives way under it. As it tries to pull itself up, 6 tells the other ragdolls not to destroy it or else their friends will be trapped inside it forever. The Brain loses its grip and falls but manages to grasp 6 and pulls him down with it. 6 cries out for the others to go to the First Room for the Source before the Brain drains his soul.\n\nSafe for the moment, 9 tells the others that he wants to abide by 6's wishes and go to the First Room, but the others are more intent on destroying the Brain once and for all. 9 decides to run to the First Room alone, where he finds schematics for the Brain and for the ragdolls themselves. He discoveres a holographic projector marked '9' and turns it on. An image of the Scientist appears and the man tells 9 about the Brain, a creation made up primarily of his own intelligence. He then tells 9 that he and the other ragdolls are vessels containing pieces of the Scientist's very soul, each representing a part of his personality. 9 was his last creation before he finally died. He shows 9 the Talisman and the sequence needed to turn the Brain off permanently.\n\nWith this knowledge, 9 returns to the others who are busy hurling bombs at the rapidly advancing Brain. 9 tells them that the Scientist is the Source but 1 continues to throw bombs. As the Brain gets closer, the dolls run and watch as the Brain becomes stuck in barbed wire, giving them time to hide in a tunnel. 9 informs the others that they have to remove the Talisman from the Brain, which suddenly sets fire to a box of bullets in the tunnel, causing a huge explosion. The ragdolls fall scattered, bruised but alive. 1, however, has lost a few fingers. 9 bravely faces the Brain and, just before he is drained, is pushed aside by 1 who is sacrificed and drained instead, having been inspired to bravery by 9. 9 then grabs the Talisman from the Brain and hits the sequence shown to him by the Scientist, aiming the Talisman back at the Brain. The Brain screams as the souls are transferred into the Talisman and the machine, soulless, explodes.\n\n3, 4, and 7 emerge and find 9 slumped to the ground, but alive. 7 tells him that he did it, but 9 responds, \"Not yet.\"\n\nThe ragdolls light a fire and set 5 positions around it for their fallen friends, each with their respective numbers. 9 hits the sequence on the Talisman and, one by one, the souls of the fallen ragdolls are released, glowing green in the night. 8 is the first out. He smiles at them, followed by 6, 2 and 5, and then by 1. 1 approaches 9 and puts his hand on his shoulder before turning and walking over to his marker on the ground. The spirits then begin to rise together, except for 5 who gives 9 a questioning glance before smiling at 9's assuring nod. He joins the others as they float towards the heavens becoming 5 columns of swirling light in the purple-colored sky. 7 takes 9's hand and tells him that their friends are finally free. The green lights coalesce, penetrating the cloud cover, and disappear in a miniature explosion. It then begins to rain for the first time in ages; a healing start to the rebirth of the planet.\n\n3, 4, 7, and 9 look up together as the rain falls on them and 7 asks 9 what will happen next. 9 answers that he's not sure but that the world is theirs now; it's what they make of it.\n\nAs the rain falls, a closeup reveals tiny microorganisms thriving in the water, indicating that life will start again to flourish in the world again ... someday ..."

    "9 Bullets": "Gypsy is a middle-aged woman living all by herself, aspiring to get her book published, which is in the works. Her main profession is that of a burlesque dancer, but she wants to shift away from it, mostly because of her aging body and because she finds her passion in writing. Her neighbor's young boy, Sam, and his pet dog, Moses, are friendly with the woman, and it is with the boy that trouble begins. One day, while Gypsy is at work, she is called up by his neighbor, Ralph, who desperately asks for her help. Ralph had stolen a large sum of money from a local criminal, Jack, and the gangster had now sent men after him to kill him and his family. Jack and Gypsy, however, have a history together, as Ralph claims she is the only person Jack would listen to. As a panicky Ralph tries to drive away from danger with his wife and mother in the car, he calls up his son, instructing him to quickly come down to a certain spot along with his iPad, for all the necessary codes and information are stored on that device. Sam reaches the designated place on time, along with his dog, but his family is shot dead almost right in front of his eyes.\n\nMeanwhile, guessing that something terrible has happened, Gypsy drives back home and finds a weeping Sam hiding in her bathroom. Although not very keen on having to disrupt her own life to essentially babysit a kid and a dog, Gypsy cannot help but provide assistance to the boy, for she knows that he would be killed if Jack gets his hands on him. Quickly packing her bags, she takes Sam and Moses on her semi-truck and drives away from their neighborhood and town, to get as far as possible from her ruthless ex-lover.\n\nGypsy's plan is to escort Sam to his uncle's place, who is a rabbi at a synagogue in a city some distance away. But the uncle does not seem to have been very connected with his brother, and although he agrees to take the child in, he asks for some time to prepare for such a sudden change in his life. Gypsy aggressively claims that the boy, too, did not get any time to prepare for such a massive change of fate and decides to hand the boy off at his uncle's place no matter what. On the way, she stops at a hotel and puts up with the boy there, and realizes that the boy is too chatty and attention-seeking for her solitary life. But she also realizes why Sam craves such love and affection, as he is, after all, a kid who has lost everyone he knew in life all of a sudden. His only companions now are his dog and his neighbor, who has been taking him away from trouble. He realizes what the trouble is, though, as Sam is an extremely intelligent and sharp kid who keeps mining and investing in cryptocurrency. But in his childhood arrogance, he often refuses to cooperate with Gypsy until apologizing and trying to get back to her good terms only a little while later.\n\nOn the other hand, Gypsy has to constantly look out for the boy's and her own safety, as Jack's men have already been following her and even questioned her about her neighbor's boy, to which she lied. After some time, she realizes that it is best to use her old charms on Jack, and she visits him at his residence, claiming to hand over her neighbor's dog to him. Jack admits that she has always been the love of his life, despite having cheated on her multiple times while being together, and that he is still interested in her. Gypsy, however, knows better, and she denies any commitment to him and manages to bring the dog back alive. Despite trying to convince Jack to let the boy alone, though, she finds out that her ex-boyfriend has placed a tracker on her car, suspecting that she has the boy with her.\n\nThey somehow manage to evade the gang men at the hotel's parking lot and then throw away the tracker on a different car, duping the men in the wrong direction. Gypsy then casually breaks into an unlocked car and steals it, only to put the men off her track. Sure enough, the men track her semi-truck down with the help of their police friends, and momentarily lose track of them. However, Gypsy and Sam shockingly realize that they are also accompanied by another woman who had been sleeping inside the car and claims it to be her own. Gypsy persuades this woman, Tasmin, to help them and drop them off at their location, and they continue to journey together. They gradually bond with Tasmin too, and take another stop, but have to rush out again as Gypsy realizes Jack has set off the police after her, claiming that Sam is a missing child. Tasmin helps them out of this situation in return for some money that Gypsy promises to give her once they get to their destination. That night, they reach Cascade, Montana, where Gypsy's close friend Lacey prepares a safe space for them. Leaving the boy and the dog back, Gypsy takes Tasmin to the local graveyard, where she digs up an empty grave, which actually contains a bag full of money that Jack had saved up for her when they were together. However, Jack also remembers this spot and confronts them here, making Tasmin flee the scene. Gypsy manages to survive the night by hiding inside a concrete casket, and Lacey gives Sam and Moses company on the other side. The next morning, they meet up at a predetermined spot, and Gypsy and Sam now drive forward towards Sam's uncle, leaving Moses behind with Lacey.\n\nAlong with the progressing plot, \"9 Bullets\" tries to build up the gradual relationship of friendliness and possible kinship between solitary Gypsy and young Sam. The woman, who is often irritated by the boy's actions and her decision to keep him tagging along, also finds company in the boy. The boy seems mentally more mature than his physical age, and despite his childly perceptions, he realizes that nobody really wants him and that Gypsy is the only one who cares about him even a small bit. Gradually, Gypsy opens up to him about her own past-she had been forced upon by a college professor, the result of which was a son that she decided to keep and raise as her own. But the child soon died tragically in a car accident, for which Gypsy still holds herself responsible, and she admits that she is not good around children because they remind her of her own child and her failure. Though such emotions are brought in, they remain restricted only to the point of being stated rather than being felt. The film overall lacks the chemistry and emotiveness that were required to make it convincing.\n\nJack and his men track down Tasmin to interrogate her about Gypsy's location, and she fearfully tells them of Lacey's house. One of the men possibly spares Tasmin's life, as she weeps that she has been returning home to her estranged mother, and then they go over to Lacey's. They are not accompanied by Jack, though, who is seen returning to his current lover, Lisa, a young, influential woman who wants Jack to get into politics. Lacey has a very aggressive reaction to the men, as she was prepared for such a visit, and shoots dead one of the men with her lethal shotgun. On the other hand, Gypsy advises Sam to return to Jack all the money that his father had stolen, for there is no end to running away from crime. She calls up Jack, asking him again to spare the child once he returns the money, and Sam does so shortly after. He and Gypsy then reach the rabbi's synagogue, where they enter and listen to a sermon about repentance. This convinces Gypsy to not leave the child behind and instead take him along with her and keep him as a part of her life.\n\nAs the two happily exit the building, though, they are tracked down by two of Jack's men, who have been promised even more money to kill Gypsy by Lisa. They manage to shoot Gypsy down, with the final shot fired by Lisa herself, who kills the woman out of jealousy. But Gypsy manages to shoot the two men dead before dying, and keeps Sam out of trouble as Lisa has no intention of killing him. The boy is shocked by the whole scene and desperately cries for help. Despite having been shot five times from point-blank range, Gypsy wakes up in the hospital a few weeks later, perhaps out of her sheer insistence from the very beginning that it would take nine bullets to kill her, as she is like a cat with nine lives. Sam joyfully welcomes her back to consciousness, and he has even identified himself as the woman's son to the doctors. Sam also reveals that he had placed a virus in the code while sending the money over to Jack, which made Jack unknowingly donate all the money to the Save the Children foundation. Sam has also managed to cleverly save three million dollars for themselves, with some of which Gypsy buys a new car after she gets healthy, and the two drive into the distance at the end of the film. They are aware, as they earlier discussed casually, that they would still have to run some more from Jack, but are willing to do it together as they have now found comfort in each other's company.

    "A Bittersweet Life": "Kim Sun-woo (Lee Byung-hun) is an enforcer and manager for a hotel owned by a cold, calculating crime boss, Kang (Kim Yeong-cheol), to whom he is unquestionably loyal. The two share concerns over business tensions with Baek Jr., a son from a rival family, which is when Kang assigns Sun-Woo what is perceived (at first) to be a simple errand while he is away on a business trip to shadow his young mistress, Heesoo (Shin Min-a), for fear that she may be cheating on him with another, much younger man, with the mandate that he must kill them both if he discovers their affair. As he performs his duty following Heesoo, and escorting her to a music recital one day he becomes quietly enthralled by the girl's beauty and innocence, as glimpses into his lonely, empty personal life become more prevalent.\n\nWhen he does come to discover Heesoo's secret lover directly in her home, he fiercely beats him, but seeing the girl's traumatized state causes him to take pause, pulled by his attraction to her. He thus spares the two on the condition that they no longer see each other again, causing her to harbour enmity towards him, despite the fact he had saved their lives at his own expense.\n\nMeanwhile, Sun-woo continues to be embroiled in personal business with Baek Jr., over having beaten up several of his henchmen earlier for overstaying their welcome at the hotel. He is then threatened by one of his enforcers to apologize, but he adamantly refuses, fueled by his frustrations over Heesoo. As he relaxes in his apartment later one night, he is suddenly kidnapped by Baek's men to be tortured, but before they can do so, they receive new orders via phone call, and he is abruptly carried off to Kang, who has returned from overseas and has found out about his attempted cover-up of Heesoo's affair. Kang's men torture him into confessing why he lied, until he is left alone to think about his answer. A daring but messy escape follows, after which Sun-woo plans his revenge.\n\nHelp from one of Sun-woo's loyal co-workers provides him with money and new clothes to go about his plan: he secretly delivers Heesoo a gift to make amends, and he sets up a meeting with some local arms dealers, but as they work for Kang's organization, he ends up killing them over a deal to buy a handgun this incurs a vendetta with the brother of one of the dealers, who promptly sets out to find Sun-woo. He then goes on to set up a fake rendezvous with Baek Jr., exchanging words and killing him as well, though he is viciously stabbed in the process. Bleeding, his violent shooting spree leads directly to Kang amidst one of his business meetings, where he vents at him his anger over how badly he has been treated, despite his many years of service. Kang remains coldly indifferent to his plight, seeing his position as absolute in the matter. Sun-woo then shoots him, prompting a shootout with Baek Jr.'s henchmen, who had quickly picked up his trail.\n\nSun-Woo emerges as the only survivor of the battle, with the arms dealer's brother finally catching up to him in the same room. Now dying from multiple gunshot wounds, he pauses to reminisce on his only day with Heesoo, when he had escorted her to her music recital; in his memory, as he watches her play her cello, he finds himself overwhelmed with emotion and, in a rare moment of contentment for Sun-woo, he smiles. As he sheds a tear over this memory, the brother puts a bullet in his head.\n\nThe next scene shows Sun-Woo looking out of a window at the city below him and then beginning to shadowbox his reflection in the glass. The ending is left ambiguous, as the viewer is unsure if everything that happened was a dream or if it is only a flashback."

    "A Good Day to Die Hard": "In Moscow, Russia, Viktor Chagarin (Sergei Kolesnikov), a high-ranking but corrupt Russian official, plans on incriminating political prisoner, former billionaire and government whistle-blower Yuri Komarov (Sebastian Koch) without a fair trial when Komarov refuses to hand over a secret file believed to have convicting evidence against Chagarin. In a separate incident, Jack McClane (Jai Courtney) is arrested as a result of an assassination but agrees to testify against Komarov for a shorter sentence.\n\nJohn McClane (Bruce Willis), who has not been in touch with his son for years, learns of Jack's situation and travels to Russia to help. When McClane arrives and approaches the courthouse that holds Jack and Komarov on trial, an explosion orchestrated by Chagarin and his henchmen occurs in the courthouse, and Jack breaks free with Komarov. Seeing his son, McClane confronts him, but their dispute is cut short when apparently Chagarin's henchmen, led by Alik (Radivoje Bukvic), chase them on the streets of Moscow. Jack leaves John behind & takes Komarov with him. McClane, Jack, and Komarov escape, when John (following in a stolen SUV), rams Alik's vehicle & causes it to topple over. Jack then decides to come back & pickup John.\n\nJack & Komarov were supposed to be extracted by the CIA, but they are directed to a safe house when Jack misses the extraction window on account of delays due to dealing with John. Jack was not at all happy to see John as father and son haven't spoken in years.\n\nHiding in a safe house, McClane finds out that Jack has been a CIA officer in an undercover operation for the past three years. Collins (Cole Hauser), Jack's partner, demands the file's location from Komarov so that the CIA can bring Chagarin down. Komarov agrees to handover the file to Collins in exchange of his & his daughter's safe passage from Russia. He says that the file is in a vault, but the key is in a hotel is Moscow.\n\nCollins is soon shot by Chagarin's men and dies, as McClane, Jack, and Komarov survive subsequent heavy gunfire and escape again. The trio then make their way to a hotel in the city to find the key to a vault containing the file. There, they meet Komarov's daughter, Irina (Yuliya Snigir), whom they earlier planned on joining with, but McClane grows suspicious of her, which is proven correct when Alik and his men crash in and tie McClane and Jack up, while Komarov is taken as a hostage, and Irina confesses to snitching on them for the \"millions of dollars\" to be gained. Jack breaks free of his ties, and the two succeed in killing most of the men. Alik and the rest of the henchmen come back on a Mil Mi-24 and try to kill them, but the two manage to escape. Meanwhile Irina takes Komarov hostage on a Mil Mi-24 copter & leaves the hotel.\n\nAlik informs Chagarin that Komarov & Irina are taking him to the location of the file. Chagarin instructs Alik to kill Irina and Komarov when he has the file in his possession. Jack tells John that Chagarin & Komarov were partners in the Chernobyl nuclear plant. They used to siphon off weapons grade uranium from the plant for black market sales. Chagarin got greedy & that caused the meltdown. Komarov & Chagarin had a bad breakup. So, Chagarin threw Komarov in jail, but Komarov kept a file that would implicate Chagarin in the Chernobyl disaster.\n\nThat night, Jack & John steal a car full of firearms and drive to Chernobyl, Ukraine, the location of the vault that houses the file. When they arrive, they find that Komarov, Irina, and Alik have already arrived, but what they don't know is that on their way there, it was revealed that there was never a file in existence, and that the drawer with the file inside was actually the secret passage to a vault containing a large amount of weapons-grade uranium. Komarov kills Alik and calls Chagarin to tell him that he and Irina had manipulated the entire sequence of events since the beginning in an attempt to obtain the uranium and get revenge on Chagarin. Chagarin is then killed by a subordinate of Komarov.\n\nAt this point, McClane and Jack enter the vault, discover Komarov's true plot, and capture him. Irina, with another henchman, comes to her father's aid, but before they can escape, Jack goes after Komarov, while McClane goes after Irina, who is escaping on a Mil Mi-26 helicopter. Irina tries to protect her father by firing the helicopter's cannons at Jack, but McClane is able to bring the helicopter out of balance by driving a truck in its hangar section, still shackled by a chain, out of the open rear ramp of the helicopter. Komarov remarks that Jack will get to watch his father die, which enrages Jack to hurl him off the rooftop into the path of the spinning helicopter's rotors, killing him. McClane is thrown off the helicopter and reunites with Jack on the building. Wanting to avenge her father, Irina rams the helicopter into the building in a suicide attack, but both father and son survive by leaping off the building and into a large pool of water as the helicopter crashes and explodes, killing Irina.\n\nHaving mended their relationship, McClane and Jack return to New York, reuniting with Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), McClane's oldest child and Jack's sister."

    "A Knight's Tale": "(As it was said, may contain SPOILERS. Well, I guess.. that's ME, as this is my favorite movie and my Favorite Actor died at my same age of 28, HEATH LEDGER)\n\nThe film takes place in the medieval times and contains many anachronisms, as it contains music and wordings that do not fit those times.\n\nIt started with 3 faithful & loyal squires: Roland (Mark Addy), Wat (Alan Tudyk) and William (Heath Ledger). As they are on their way to Victory, all 4 together with the Knight took a little rest and when Roland came to his lord (their knight) he found out that he is no longer breathing and is already dead. They no longer have the chance to participate in the final round of Jousting, (a sport during the Medieval times).\n\nWilliam took the armor vest and wore it to join the jousting, where he won consecutively. Together with the 2 squires, he trained himself the use of Sword and Lance as it may be his edge for such game.\n\nWhen they are on their way to a place were there is a Jousting and Sword competition, they encountered a writer, Geoffrey Chaucer. He joined the three and he stood as the Herald of Sir Ulrich Von Lichtenstein from Gelderland, the name William has adopted to pose as a nobleman.\n\nGeoff presented Ulrich to the panel and told them that Sir Ulrich will compete for Sword and Jousting.\n\nAs Ulrich was wandering around that area, singing, he saw a beautiful lady (Shannyn Sossamon)and he followed her. Insisting for her name, the lady asked if he would care if she is ugly. Ulrich was speechless.\n\nUlrich had just finished his first jousting round, when a man approached him and he said that he was there because of Ulrich's Herald. He found out that Geoff had a serious gambling problem. He was unclothed by two men as his punishment. Ulrich asked the two men to release him and give him back his clothes and repay them after the game. They then released Geoff and on their way out, Geoff said that he actually is a writer, he lied before and has gambling issues. Ulrich started to compete with the sword just after they talked. People were so impressed, as he gains consecutive wins. He's proclaimed a Sword Champ.\n\nPrepared for another jousting, Sir Ulrich pointed to Geoff the woman he liked, it's the woman he saw while he was roaming in the crowded area. Geoff commented that Ulrich is so ambitious and is going too far now.\n\nWilliam persists to ask the lady her name. The lady didn't say her name, instead she said, \"You Persist?\" Another knight was sitting beside the lady, Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell) and humiliated him about the suit of armor Ulrich was wearing and of how Ulrich says his name. Ulrich was pissed, he left and went on to his game.\n\nDuring one of his games, he faced the Black Prince of Wales and hit him with 2 points. Realizing that the competitor belongs to royal blood, Ulrich calls it a draw and spared Prince Edward.\n\nHe impressed the crowd with his fearless fight and merciful judgment. Even Count Adhemar and his Herald were impressed.\n\nFrom one of his games, he had a very strong hit on the chest and his vest needs to be fixed. They went to several blacksmiths, but the blacksmiths asks for a \"money-down-to-fix\". One of the blacksmiths suggested they try approaching the Lady Farrier just next to them and see what she can do.\n\nKate, the Lady Farrier, also refused and said that she doesn't work for free, but when she felt that she was underestimated by the other blacksmiths, she took Ulrich's vest and successfully fixed it.\n\nBefore the game starts with Count Adhemar as his contender, the lady's maid approached William and said she had a message from the lady. The lady wished to tell William that her name is Lady Jocelyn and handed over a piece of cloth. William accepted it gratefully and was inspired. With two consecutive nice hits to Count Adhemar, and Adhemar not hitting Ulrich, he decided to hit Ulrich on the face and flash of William's memory went on during his childhood with his father, wishing that one day he'll change the stars and he'll be a knight.\n\nWhen the game ended, Count Adhemar picked up the piece of cloth that Ulrich had dropped. Adhemar handed back the cloth to Lady Jocelyn and she left without a word.\n\nAfter winning, Ulrich paid Geoff's penalty to Simon the Summoner (Steven O'Donnell) and Peter the Pardoner (Jonathan Slinger) from Rouen.\n\nKate commented that the armor which Ulrich was wearing was not originally made for him, and she offered to make new armor. Ulrich asked how much would it cost. She said it would cost nothing, but instead take her as far as Paris. Ulrich refused and said that they walk alone, then asked her to take her gold (a payment for the vest fix).\n\nAs they were packing up their stuff, Geoff suggested to them that they should stay and Ulrich should attend the dance party. Ulrich and Geoff had an argument about whether he should attend or not. Minutes after, Lady Jocelyn's maiden approached them and ask what color and kind of tunic Ulrich will wear in the dance party. As Geoff answered that they wouldn't be attending, Ulrich blocked Geoff and said don't speak of things he doesn't understand. Ulrich asked Roland what tunic he will wear tonight. Roland, shocked, described the attire based on the tent that he is facing. Then the maiden left. Ulrich dejectedly said he couldn't dance. All 5 of them, Kate, Geoff, Wat, Roland and Ulrich went to a place where they can work on Ulrich's Tunic and Dance problem. Kate and Geoff helped teach the dance. Wat, being bullied by Geoff as always, became Ulrich's partner during the practice, while Roland fixes the tunic.\n\nRoland managed to make the tunic while William learns the steps. Ulrich attended the gathering. He and Lady Jocelyn both wore green colored attires. They dance similar to a Farandol but with lots of differences, (especially modern moves. OST- Golden Years by David Bowie) which makes the scenario anachronism.\n\nJousting took place again the next day were Count Alemar is to face the Black Prince of Wales: Prince Edward as his opponent. Alemar calls it a draw. Just to impress the crowd. Ulrich on the other hand, though he was informed that he will be fighting against Prince Edward for the second time, decides to fight him anyway. Wat, Ronald and Geoff told Ulrich about this but Ulrich still went on with the fight and hit Prince Edward squarely in the chest with 2 points. Edward loses the game. Geoff approach Ulrich and ask if he knows what he's doing. Ulrich told Geoff that Edward is taking the risk and is putting himself to danger and told Edward that he knows that he is a prince. Edward appeared stunned and wondered why Ulrich would still go on even if he knew what he is. Ulrich said that it is not in him to withdraw. \"But it happens\" added Prince Edward. Sir Ulrich was named Jousting Champion. But William/Ulrich still has the feeling of a 2nd placer as Count Alemar withdraws and he did not defeat him in a Joust.\n\nThey went through different jousting competitions and they couldn't find Count Alemar. Unknown by them, count Alemar went to Gelderland to research Sir Ulrich's genealogy. He failed to see Ulrich's name on the painting as he doesn't exist. He found out that Ulrich is a fraud.\n\nUlrich sent a sweet letter that was composed by him, Kate, Wat, Ronald and Geoff writing it for Lady Jocelyn and asking if she would come to Paris.\n\nJocelyn got the letter, had tears in her eyes and Wat asked if she has something for his master in return. Jocelyn smiled.\n\nWat, going back to were Ulrich and the rest were, said that Jocelyn is going to Paris with them. Sir Ulrich asked if she gave something in return. Wat kissed William on the lips and William shouted YES. He knew that Lady Jocelyn just send him the kiss. HE was so HAPPY!\n\nIn Paris, Ulrich/William meets w/ Jocelyn in a church, where she tells him that if he truly loved her, he would lose. Ulrich tells her that's nuts. The next day at the jousting tournament, however, Ulrich intentionally loses all his matches...until, that is, Jocelyn sends word that if he loves her, he'll not lose another match & will win the tournament...which he does. That nite Jocelyn tells him that she knows his friends sometimes call him William, but she doesn't care what his name is. She crawls into bed w/ him, & tho he's hurt from the losses earlier that day, they seem to be able to get the deed done. .\n\nOn their way to London, William had a flashback of a childhood memory. It was a time when he and his father were on their way to London on a boat. It was at that time that young William came to the attention of the knight who apprenticed him. He's torn between wanting to go w/ the knight & not wanting to leave his father. His father gives him his blessing & tells him all he has to do to find his way back is to follow his feet.\n\nNow that they are in London, Geoff informed Ulrich (William) that Count Alemar is on the list to compete. Ulrich and Alemar saw each other and Count Alemar said that Lady Jocelyn will be his bride no matter what it takes.\n\nThat night Ulrich, on his horse, roams around the area while it is raining when he sees a little girl playing with a stick like it was her lance. The little girl told Ulrich that he was her favorite knight and she wondered why Ulrich is roaming in that area. Ulrich told the little girl that he used to live there and he asks the little girl if he knows a man who looks like a knight that had lived just around the other corner, but probably died long ago, possibly before she was born. The little girl told Ulrich that she also lives there and she knows the man Ulrich is pertaining to. She said that the man still lives there, but is blind and been there for years.\n\nUlrich, with his curiosity went to that place and saw an old man fixing a fisherman's net. John Thatcher (William's Father) heard a squeak from the stairs and asked \"if somebody is there?\" He thought that the person on the stairs was the owner of the net and advised him to come back tomorrow as he is not yet done with it. Then, John Thatcher asked again, \"Who Are You?\". Ulrich answered \"A Knight\" and said that he is Ulrich. John said that he knew him as his name is being chanted in the stadium. John asked what business he has there. Ulrich said that he has a message for John coming from his son. John was stunned. He asked him to come inside and asked for his son's message. Ulrich said that \"Your son has changed his stars\". With teary eyes, John has recognized this phrase and asked if his son has followed his feet. Ulrich answered \"YES\". And he knew that the knight standing in front of him, the one with whom he is now speaking, is his SON WILLIAM. They hugged each other and cried.\n\nThey had dinner and William mentioned that he has a girlfriend. His father told him that he wants to meet her. But Ulrich changed the topic to the water dripping from the roof. William fixes the leak. Unknown to him, Count Alemar has followed him and confirmed that he is a fraud and doesn't belong to a Royal line. In the morning, Ulrich is so happy that he told Wat, Ronald and Kate that he has spoken with his father and it was a great time in his life.\n\nGeoff and Jocelyn approach. The four of them appear as if someone has died. William asks why they are sad. Geoff and Jocelyn tell William that people knew already who he was and they are waiting for him to be arrested and put in the stocks.\n\nAll were shocked with the terrible news and Ronald suggested packing their things up. William refused and asked Lady Jocelyn what she thinks. Lady Jocelyn suggested to RUN and do it for LOVE, instead of seeing him being placed in the stocks.\n\nRonald, Kate, Wat and Geoff agreed with Lady Jocelyn. But furious William firmly refused and said \"I'M A KNIGHT\", indicating that I Knight would not be so cowardly.\n\nRonald commented that everything must be put to an end. They prepared Ulrich and they went to the game. Officers approached them and told William that he should remove himself from the game of honor. But William answered that he is there to compete. They said that he is here to be arrested. And he was arrested and was put in jail.\n\nCount Alemar visited William and reiterates the words he keeps on saying while he punches him. With every punch he says \"YOU HAVE BEEN WEIGHED\", \"YOU HAVE BEEN MEASURED\" \"AND YOU HAVE BEEN FOUND WANTING\". Then with a last punch on the stomach, Count Alemar leaves.\n\nThe next day, William is placed in the stocks and there's one boy who slapps his head as everyone applaudes what the boy has done.\n\nRonald, Wat, Kate and Geoff stand by his side and don'tt leave him. 2 men with hoods stand there in the audience and when they reveal their faces. the people find out that it is the Black Prince of Wales, Prince Edward. He approaches William and tells him how William's men love him and if he knew nothing else about him that would be enough. He tells the guards to release William and ask how he can repay the kindness William once showed him. He asks William to kneel. Prince Edward takes his sword and proclaimes William, SIR William.\n\nApplause went on and Prince Edward asks William if he is fit to compete. He said that he can prepare for his opponent. Sir William, officially the new knight, thanked his lord, Prince Edward.\n\nThe Final battle between Sir William and Count Alemar has come. Alemar cheats by placing a sharp tip on his lance. They rode and Count Alemar hit William on the right side of his chest. The tipped lance was left in his chest and Ronald had to pull it out. Wat and Geoff found out that Alemar is cheating. William is severely injured by the 1st attack. And with much pain in his chest, he dropped his lance and was hit again for the 2nd time by Count Alemar. Ronald said that the only way to win the game is un-horse him or to kill him.\n\nBeing in so much pain, he asked Kate to remove his Armor Vest so he can breathe well. He asked her not to put it back again. Kate looks at Ronald and he agreed. He couldn't carry the lance anymore so he asked Wat to tie the lance on his arm. Wat looks at Ronald again and he said do whatever William says. When the game is about to start, Geoff made a heartfelt introduction for William,from the Prince's viewing box, to buy him time to get the lance lashed to his arm, as the joust was about to start and Will was not yet ready. Geoff introduced him as the son of John Thatcher and with his official title, everybody knew that he is Sir William Thatcher. Wat told William that everybody heard Williams name including his father. Geoff said \"Godspeed William\".\n\nWilliam with no vest and a a lance tied to his arm, rode on his horse and fought with Count Alemar. When he is about to reach Count Alemar, he shouted \"WILLIAM\" and hit Alemar squarely in the chest, bringing him down off his horse. Count Alemar fell and had a vision of himself flat on his back on the ground, with the 5 people he hates. Wat stood above him saying \"HE HAS BEEN WEIGHED\", then comes Ronald saying \"YOU HAVE BEEN MEASURED\", then Kate said \"AND YOU ABSOLUTELY\" Geoff came above him and added \"HAVE BEEN FOUND WANTING\" finally, William completed the circle saying WELCOME TO THE NEW WORLD. GOD SAVE YOU, IF IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. Then they left him.\n\nVictoriously, William and his friends rejoiced. His father is so pleased and so is Prince Edward. Lady Jocelyn is so proud of him.\n\nThe story ends where Ronald, Kate, Geoff and Wat were leaning forward at the center of the stadium as Geoff is thinking about writing a story about everything that had happened, bullying Wat \"Maybe Not Yours\".\n\nEnd\n\n\"In Memory of Heath Ledger\""

    "A Murder of Crows": "Images of haywire outside a prison. It's a rainy night. A police car arrives. The new inmate in cell 6 used to be a lawyer, Lawson Russell (Cuba Gooding Jr.). He speaks in the voiceover and says that people love to see a lawyer trapped in prison, as the system is seen as something which protects the strong versus the week, and he says that he started to understand that a Thursday, during Carnival time.\n\nCut to New Orleans, during Carnival time. People drinking and a girl who shows off her breasts to the cheering crowd. Lawson alleges he's just met his consciousness, that it wouldn't go away, and that a lawyer is not allowed to have one. He phones Judge Banning, and somebody dressed up as the devil who has just broken produces a gun while he's giving that person his back and talking on the phone. Judge Wiley Banning (Carmen Argenziano) is dressed up as Caesar in a party at his home. Lawson wants to recuse himself and resign from his present case. Banning tells him that he's bound to win the case, so that he's being stupid, and he screams at Lawson saying that he wants to see him in his chambers the following day. Lawson admits that it was professional suicide. Banning calls Lawson's present client, Thurman Parks III (Eric Stoltz).\n\nThurman and Lawson had grown up together. Thurman was the mayor's son, and Lawson was a lawyer's son. Thurman had killed a dancer, smothering her with her pantyhose. Lawson says that juries won't declare over the innocence or otherwise of an accused person, but over the abilities of the best lawyer. Lawson says that he showed the jurors a photograph of the half-naked body of the deceased until they were desensitized and it became meaningless, while the parents of the girl were devastated. Lawson recognises that the strategy was working. Talking in private in Lawson's office, Thurman becomes cocky, saying that he had told \"that bitch\" that he'd get away with it, referring to an unknown reporter the audience knows nothing about. That admission makes Russell cringe. They had been preparing the questions and answers Thurman would answer the following day in court. It was a rainy night as well, the wind pushes open the windows, and Lawson says that the case saved his life.\n\nThe plaintiff, Billy Ray Richardson (Doug Wert) and Lawson are arguing in front of Banning. The judge tells him that he'll have Russell disbarred if he doesn't finish the case. The jury foreman (David Willis) calls for everybody to rise when Banning enters the room. Russell says that if you are very rich, as Thurman was, proof is very hard to come by. He's looking at the victim's photograph while Banning tells him to start, and Thurman smirks triumphantly to him, which it's the last straw for him.\n\nThurman is going to testify before the jury. He starts saying what he'd memorized: on the 17th of June he was in the Silverband Club having a drink with Janey Broussard (Tara Crespo), the deceased. Lawson asks Thurman what they talked about out of the blue; Thurman answers, but afterwards, Lawson shouts to him if she could say something while he killed her. Thurman doesn't want to answer, Banning tries to stop this thread of inquires, declares him out of order and a police officer finally takes Lawson away.\n\nIt was declared a mistrial. Lawson Russell gets disbarred and he has to leave his office. His best friend Elizabeth Pope (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) tries to defend her friend, but it was an impossible feat. The Louisiana Chief of Justice (Sharon Samples) disbars Lawson. Elizabeth tries to offer some consolation, saying that he defended the innocent and punished the guilty, and that his late father would be proud of his son. Lawson decides to go back to Key West, where his father had left a house, to write a John Grisham-like novel.\n\nA year afterwards, a sick old man supposedly called Christopher Marlowe hires Russell and his boat to go out fishing. Lawson is drunk, but they bond over the fishing. Marlowe talks about his late wife while Lawson says that he could feel something odd in his customer. Later, they go to a bar to have some drinks, which Churkie (Shawn C. Suttles) serves. Marlowe asks for a daiquiri, Hemingway's favourite. They talk about pocket watches, and Marlowe says that his is special, as it has a sing-song music. Russell tells Marlowe that he's a writer now, but that he used to be a barrister. Marlowe begins bad-mouthing lawyers. Lawson admits he had fun, but he's as sure as hell glad when he says goodbye to him.\n\nBack home, the following morning, Lawson orders the sale of some of his stock, as he's not earning enough money to pay for his expenses and he may lose the house - which he doesn't even want to think about. His book, after a year, was only on page 6. He admits that writing is very hard. At this moment, Marlowe pops in. He seems to feel a bit sick, so Lawson offers him a glass of water. Marlowe produces a novel he's just written, and he asks Lawson to read it and give him his honest opinion. The frail man leaves, and tells Lawson to take his time reading his novel, and that they may meet up at the same bar at night. Lawson turns off his computer and starts reading A Murder of Crows, by Christopher Marlowe. It begins with a William Shakespeare's quotation: First thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.\n\nA Murder of Crows is about 5 Southern defense attorneys who defend people who they know they are guilty but are finally acquainted. These lawyers are all rich, but they are killed in revenge of their defending rich clients. The suspenseful thriller novel is so exciting, that Lawson goes to the bar to meet Marlowe, but Churkie tells him that he's already left, feeling bad. When Lawson goes to the boarding hotel where Marlowe leaves, he can only see Goethe, a police officer that the old man died without family of natural causes - a heart attack. What Lawson knows doesn't match up with what Goethe knows, as Marlowe had told his landlady (Ellen Gerstein) that he had not family. Goethe says that spouses sometimes go after one another in less than a year. He suggests Russell lights a candle in Saint Andrew's. Goethe says that Marlowe will be cremated tomorrow, and that his belongings will go to the state, so Lawson holds onto A Murder of Crows.\n\nLawson looks for a publishing house for the computer-version he's plagiarised. Janine DeVrie (Ashley Laurence), owner of DeVrie Publishers, is immediately interested. She treats him as a start from the beginning. The book is an instant bestseller, and Lawson can afford a sports car, a jewellery watch, and he starts a relationship with Janine DeVrie while making it up to the cover of Forbes magazine among others. Janine suggests an advance over Russell's following book. She takes him to his mansion by limousine and they make wild sex. Her nipple is pierced. Outside her one-of-a-15-bedroom room, crows gather.\n\nA white-trash man whose surname is Dubose asks for Russell's signature in a long line of people at Planet Hollywood. The audience realises that it's the same man as Goethe and Marlowe, but Lawson pays no attention, in spite of his complaint about having an impersonal greeting. Elizabeth Pope congratulates him as well. It's then when Lawson realises what he's done, and that there would never be a \"next book\". He realises he's a thief, and that he was losing the only decent thing in his life - Elizabeth. He takes a rest to have a smoke, and Thurman appears with his novel in his hands. He's been acquainted in a second trial. Truman threatens him. It looks as if Thurman knew Janine making a stupid remark about her \"not forgetting his whip\".\n\nA hand-gloved person sends a signed copy of the book to Clifford \"Cliff\" Dubose (Tom Berenger), and the packet is waiting for him when he returns from his holiday in Jamaica. This Dubose is clearly NOT the Dubose the book was signed for. He starts reading it after feeding his car. A New Orleans desk Sergeant (Robert Peters) mockingly greets Dubose. A police technician who was sleeping while on duty looks for murder victims whose occupation prior was being a lawyer.\n\nDubose arrests Lawson. Billy Ray accuses Russell of having killed the 5 victims, disguising the crimes as suicides or accidents and then telling everything in the book. Obviously, Russell says it's a coincidence, but Billy Ray says that even details which were not released to the press appeared in the book. Immediately, Lawson realises that he burnt the only thing which could prove he didn't write A Murder of Crows, as he had put the original manuscript into the fire. Dubose was the investigator of the first case, which had been disguised as a burglary gone awry. Lawson won't speak anymore, and he asks for an attorney. Billy Ray cynically wishes him good luck in finding one, as he knows that the association of lawyers had condemned his novel, so he will have problems to hire one. So Lawson calls for Elizabeth Pope's help. He tells her that he'll collaborate with the police if he's let outside. While he and Pope leave the police station, Dubose tells Richardson that Russell is guilty, because he's looked at him. Dubose tells his officers to follow Russell, and Billy Ray says that he knows the judge who would sign a search warrant.\n\nLawson checks in the newspaper news about the five murdered attorneys. She can't believe it when he tells her that he's got no source apart from a manuscript he himself had destroyed in his fireplace. Pope refuses to represent him. On his way back home, Lawson mocks one of the officers (Chad Rose) who are following him, but to his dismay, his house is being searched. Dubose gives permission to the searchers to be \"particularly destructive\", and somewhere something made of glass gets broken. Dubose admits he likes the analogy between crows and lawyers in A Murder of Crows. Some compromising photographs from the murders have been planted in the Kitchen cupboard. Thurman laughs out loud when the story breaks the news, which a half-naked woman (Gaelle Comparat) is playing with a toy train. Janine is angry, because the media (Ren\u00e9e Est\u00e9vez) puts pressure on her and her company inquiring whether she knew about the book murders being real. She is more than satisfied in private, though, as she comments with her attractive attorney (Glendon Rich) that the book would be the best sale.\n\nMeanwhile, Lawson is at large, escaping by train.\n\nA county clerk (Anastasia Roussel-Drake) checks the deaths of Marlowe, and the existence of a Detective Goethe. It's only then when Russell realises that both are writer-based aliases when she mentions the German writer. He reads Christopher Marlow's Faust, a man who sells his soul to the devil, and both writers did masterpieces on the topic.\n\nHe returns home to pick up a gun. Two police officers (Eric James and Jim Hanna) see him, but he goes to the clerk office of courts. He steals a subpoena and gives it to Evans, Marlowe's landlady. He paid in cash and left after a week. He produces the subpoena to see all the March phone registers. Evans says that Marlowe always used the phone booth in the corner. Two cooperative and flirting phone company supervisors - one male, one female - cooperate with Lawson. Russell has to run away from several police cars, but they (Julie Letche) lose him.\n\nDubose and Richardson complain that the FBI is taking over the case and neither of them want to speak to reporters. Dubose thinks that Lawson wants to commit suicide, and that's why he hasn't left the contry. Lawson goes to Baton Rouge. All calls were local, except one to Althea Delroy (Deneen Taylor), who lives in Jackson Street at the Garden District. Thurman Parks used to live there as well, but he didn't have Althea's number. Thurman and Janine are hooking up and slapping each other. Pope learns that Althea Delroy was a single mother who was a housekeeper and who owed 59,000 dollars of her condo. She leaves the info on a table - from where it disappears. Lawson follows Althea, who was Prof. Arthur Corvus (Mark Pellegrino)'s housekeeper. Lawson recognises him immediately. Corvus is analyzing and discussing Hamlet with students Laura (Marisa Petroro-Parker) and James (Nate Adams).\n\nAt the Corvus' house, he sees photographs of the wife and little child. The child's room smelled of humidity, so he guessed she must have been at boarding school. At Corvus' laptop, he finds nothing, but then he searches everything, and finds Marlowe's pocket watch. Corvus is a professor of scriptwriting, acting, literature, and he was the Marlowe, Goethe and the book-sign guy. Althea looks startled at the escaping Russell.\n\nCorvus arrives home and worries if something happened to Althea. She's speaking to the police, and has recognised Lawson Russell. Corvus pretends not to know who he is straight away. He speaks to Dubose. When Dubose asks about Corvus' family, he doesn't reply, because the FBI arrive and Dubose is not too happy about it. Dubose thinks that there's no relation between Corvus and Russell, and that he was looking for a place to hide away.\n\nJeffrey Lowell was the first murder victim. He had defended a banker who had hit-and-run a lady and her daughter. They were Jean and Trudy Corvus. Lowell got a release on a technicality, as the arresting officer hadn't read the banker his rights. Somebody recognises Russell and he has to run away.\n\nMeanwhile, Corvus is loading up a gun. He makes Lawson sit down while threatening him with the gun. They have a conversation at gunpoint and they tell everything.\n\nWhen Corvus is about to shoot Russell, Dubose appears. Dubose asks for back up, but Corvus kills him. Corvus wants to put the blame on Russell. Both fight. Lawson points the gun which killed Dubose to Corvus, leaving his fingerprints on it. Realising there's no way out, Russell kills Corvus.\n\nCut to the prison. Elizabeth visits him. They hold hands.\n\nLawson is a millionaire - the sale numbers for his book went to the roof.\n\nBanning judged Russell's case, so the best criminal attorney saved Lawson.\n\nAs a free man, he moves to a summer destination. He says that the rich and powerful can always trod on the weak and meed, but that all everyone can hope for is a little justice once in a while.\n\n-- written by KrystelClaire"

    "A View to a Kill": "MI6 agent James Bond (Roger Moore) is sent to Siberia to locate the body of 003 and recover a Soviet microchip. Upon doing so, he is ambushed by Soviet troops but flees in a submarine. Q analyzes the microchip, establishing it to be a copy of one designed to withstand an electromagnetic pulse, made by government contractor Zorin Industries. somebody inside Zorin is connected to the KGB.. Miss Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell) & Frederick Gray (Geoffrey Keen), the British Minister of Defence.\n\nBond visits Ascot Racecourse to observe the company's owner, Max Zorin (Christopher Walken) (a psychopathic industrialist, the product of a Nazi genetic experiment, who plans to destroy Silicon Valley to gain a monopoly in the microchip market). Sir Godfrey Tibbett (Patrick Macnee), a racehorse trainer and MI6 agent, believes Zorin's horses, which win consistently, are drugged, although tests proved negative. Through Tibbett, Bond meets with French private detective Achille Aubergine, who informs Bond that Zorin is holding a horse sale later in the month. During their dinner at the Eiffel Tower, Aubergine is assassinated by Zorin's bodyguard May Day (Grace Jones) (Zorin's lover and chief of staff. She seemingly possesses superhuman strength), who subsequently escapes (rescued by Zorin in a speedboat in the river).\n\nBond and Tibbett travel to Zorin's estate for the horse sale. Tibbet poses as Bond's valet. Tibbet wanders into the stables and finds one horse vanishes after being brought into the stables. Bond notices a woman visiting Zorin, who has written her a check for $5 million. At night, Bond and Tibbett break into Zorin's laboratory, where he is implanting adrenaline-releasing devices in his horses. They also find Zorin's warehouse with millions of crates of microchips. Zorin identifies Bond as an agent, has May Day assassinate Tibbett, and attempts to have Bond killed by dropping their car in the lake (with both Bond and Tibbet inside) (Bond survives by breathing air from the tires). General Gogol (Walter Gotell) of the KGB confronts Zorin for killing Bond without permission, revealing that Zorin was initially trained and financed by the KGB but has now gone rogue. Later, Zorin unveils to a group of investors his plan (\"Main Strike\") to destroy Silicon Valley, which will give him-and the potential investors-a monopoly over microchip manufacture. Silicon valley has 250 plants producing 80% of the world's supply of micro chips. Zorin wants $100MM from each investor for this task.\n\nBond goes to San Francisco and meets with CIA agent Chuck Lee (David Yip), who claims Zorin is the product of medical experimentation with steroids performed by Dr. Carl Mortner (Willoughby Gray), a Nazi scientist who is now Zorin's physician. Mortner was grabbed by the KGB after the war, and hence was never tried for war crimes. Bond then investigates a nearby oil rig owned by Zorin (after reports that all crabs near that oil station just disappeared), and while there finds KGB agent Pola Ivanova (Fiona Fullerton) recording conversations and her partner placing explosives on the rig. Ivanova's partner is caught by May Day and killed (Bond has gone underwater to check what Zorin was up to. The pumps were turned on and Bond had use his Oxygen tank to jam the fans and escape. This led to a search and capture of Pola's partner. Zorin thinks KGB wants to eliminate him), but Ivanova and Bond escape. They spend a night together recounting past stories and Pola sees Bond take the recording. Later Ivanova takes the recording from Bond's case, but finds that Bond had switched tapes. Bond is perplexed that Zorin is pumping seawater into his pipelines.\n\nBond tracks down State Geologist Stacey Sutton (Tanya Roberts) at the California office of conservation, the woman Zorin attempted to pay off, and discovers that Zorin is trying to buy her family oil business. Stacey tells Bond how she has used all of her money to fight Zorin in the courts and has sold even her furniture. The two travel to San Francisco City Hall to check Zorin's submitted plans (on how many oil wells he has near the silicon valley area) after Bond tells Stacey that Zorin is pumping sea water into his oil wells instead of taking crude out (this has the potential to trigger a major quake). However, Zorin, who has been alerted to their presence, kills the Chief Geologist and Lee, and sets fire to the building to frame Bond for the murders and kill him at the same time (by trapping them inside an elevator and setting fire to it). Bond and Stacey escape in a fire engine when the police try to arrest him.\n\nBond and Stacey infiltrate Zorin's mine, discovering his plot to detonate explosives beneath the lakes along the Hayward and San Andreas faults, which will cause them to flood (produce a massive earthquake as a result) and submerge Silicon Valley forever. A larger bomb is also in the mine to destroy a \"geological lock\" that prevents the two faults from moving simultaneously. Once in place, Zorin and his security chief Scarpine (Patrick Bauchau) flood the mines and kill the workers. Stacey escapes while Bond fights May Day; when she realizes Zorin abandoned her, she helps Bond remove the larger bomb, putting the device onto a handcar and riding it out of the mine, where it explodes and kills her.\n\nEscaping in his airship with Scarpine and Mortner, Zorin abducts Stacey while Bond grabs hold of the airship's mooring rope. Zorin tries to knock him off, but Bond manages to moor the airship to the framework of the Golden Gate Bridge. Stacey attacks Zorin to save Bond, and in the fracas, Mortner and Scarpine are temporarily knocked out. Stacey flees and joins Bond out on the bridge, but Zorin follows them out with an ax. The ensuing fight between Zorin and Bond culminates with Zorin falling to his death. Mortner attempts to attack Bond with dynamite, but Bond cuts the airship free, causing Mortner to drop the dynamite in the cabin, blowing up the airship and killing himself and Scarpine.\n\nGeneral Gogol wishes to award Bond the Order of Lenin for foiling Zorin's scheme, but M (Robert Brown) reports that he is missing. At Stacy's home, Q (Desmond Llewelyn) sends a remote-controlled surveillance robot in to search the residence, whereupon it discovers Bond in the bathroom with Stacey."

    "A-X-L": "Miles Hill (Alex Neustaedter) is an aspiring motocross racer, but his father Chuck (Thomas Jane) thinks he should aspire to look beyond racing and toward a better future. Miles frequently disagrees with Chuck, as Miles doesn't think he can get into college, and they are also strained after the death of his mother.\n\nAt a tech company called Crane Systems, scientists Andric (Dominic Rains) and Randall (Lou Taylor Pucci) are on the lookout for a missing asset of theirs, a robotic dog called AXL (Attack, Exploration, Logistics).\n\nMiles goes to a party at the home of a rich kid named Sam Fontaine (Alex MacNicoll), who mooches off his wealthy father. Sam is also into extreme sports. Miles goes to meet Sara Reyes (Becky G), who lives with her mother Johanna (Patricia De Leon) since she works for Sam's family.\n\nMiles is invited by Sam and his buddies around the hills to take videos of Miles riding his motorcycle. Sam's friends pour a purple drink into Miles's tank when he's not looking, and he wipes out when he tries to make a jump. Sam and the others leave Miles with merely a bag and a jug of fuel before they abandon him.\n\nNot far from where he is, Miles comes across AXL, who initially views him as a threat, but Miles proves to AXL that he is friendly. Being amazed at finding a robot dog, Miles tries to figure out what to do with AXL.\n\nSara locates Miles after pressing Sam for his location. She meets AXL and is at first freaked out but then quickly warms up to him when Miles proves AXL is friendly. They spend the night around the area sitting by a campfire as they discuss their personal lives, like the death of Miles's mom and how Sara's father was absent.\n\nMeanwhile, Andric and Randall continue to monitor AXL's movements and interactions, and they see when Miles finds a special key that allows him control and access to AXL.\n\nSara starts drawing on the wall to show off her skills. AXL mimics the movements, and something in him turns on that shows Miles and Sara a video explaining what AXL is, and that he was designed as some kind of killing machine. Miles tells AXL that is not what he really is.\n\nJohanna asks Sam where Sara went, and he goes to the yard to find her. She argues with him when he acts as though she is leaving him for Miles. He goes to attack Miles, but AXL pounces on Sam. Before he can do any harm, Sara tells Miles to get AXL off Sam. Miles lets Sam off after warning him to keep away from Sara, but this only upsets her because it creates problems between Sam's family and her own.\n\nMiles and Sara go back to Miles's house after they keep AXL hidden. Miles tries to tell Chuck about AXL, but he doesn't want his son keeping something dangerous and illegal. At the same time, Sam and his goons go to find AXL where they attack him with a flamethrower and severely damage him. Miles and Sara are notified of this on their phones, and they run back to save AXL.\n\nThey take AXL back to Miles's garage where AXL gets repaired and reboots his system. He replays the last memory of Sam saying where he's going, and he goes to find him at a party. After scaring away the other party-goers, AXL attacks Sam and nearly kills him until Miles and Sara intervene. However, drones sent by Andric incapacitate AXL, and he gets captured along with Miles and Sara.\n\nBack at Crane, Andric tries to interrogate Miles for the key to AXL. Sara is held by a reprogrammed AXL to guard her, but she manages to override his system by reminding him of who she is and that he's good. AXL helps Miles and Sara get out, just as military officials arrive to seize AXL. AXL and Miles break out, leaving Andric and Randall to get arrested. The drones and a military helicopter go after AXL. He and Miles share one final moment as AXL runs off into the distance so that he can self-destruct to avoid captivity.\n\nMiles heads off with Sara to an unknown place. They are on the beach when they receive a package from Chuck. It's the key to AXL. Miles turns it on, and a signal appears, indicating that AXL is still somehow alive."

    "AK vs AK": "An aspiring filmmaker, Yogita, is filming Anurag Kashyap for a documentary. Kashyap and Anil Kapoor are interviewed by Sucharita Tyagi for a MAMI event. Anil wants Anurag to do a film together, but Anurag is non-responsive and dismissive to Anil, since Anil ignored Anurag when he was a big star and Anurag was just starting out. Now Anil, is a has been, while Anurag is hot property. After an audience member asks if the director or the actor is more important, they start arguing about the question and insulting each other's careers, culminating in Kashyap throwing a glass of water in Kapoor's face. This becomes a major scandal for Kashyap, with other film personalities cutting ties with him and backing out of his projects. The story started in 2007 when Anurag offered the movie \"Allwyn Kalicharan\" to Anil, and he refused, and Anurag never forgot that. As Anurag sits in his bedroom enraged, Yogita gives him an idea.\n\nLater, on Christmas Eve and Kapoor's birthday, Kashyap visits his set along with Yogita and pitches him a new story about a mad director who kidnaps the daughter of an aging actor. Anil keeps Anurag waiting for 3 hours before he meets him. Kapoor is initially uninterested as he believes that this is a prank. Anurag says that the movie has started, which Yogita is shooting, Anil is the hero and Anurag is the villain. Anil realizes that his daughter, Sonam, has actually been abducted by Kashyap, who wants to capture his real reactions during his search. Anurag has Sonam's phone. Kashyap tells him that he has ten hours (until sunrise the next day, which is now 10 hours away) to find her and sets four rules: he can't get anyone else involved, no calls to the police, all phone calls must be on speakerphone, and Yogita's camera must always stay on. Anurag says that if Anil harms him, the same treatment will be don't to Sonam as the video is being transmitted live to the hostage location.\n\nKapoor first tries going to a police station, but Kashyap and Yogita convince the police inspector that this is just a rehearsal for their film. Kapoor is desperate and begs the police for help, but they clap at what they believe is his brilliant acting. Kapoor is still somewhat unconvinced that Sonam was really abducted, so Kashyap shows a live feed of her being held by a masked man with a knife.\n\nAfter talking to his son Harshvardhan, Kapoor learns from her driver that she was last seen at a hotel. Sonam was supposed to participate in a fashion show, but the show manager says that Sonam left after the rehearsal and didn't show up for the show. Anil bribes the hotel manager there with an endorsement to see the CCTV footage and spots the getaway driver's face; however, his search on the streets of Mumbai (asking the cab drivers if they recognize the getaway driver found in the hotel video) returns little success.\n\nKapoor goes home where his wife has held a Birthday party for him. Brother Boney is also there. Anil stealthily texts Harshvardhan at the dinner table saying, \"help me find Sonam\", but Harsh's confused reaction alerts Kashyap, who confronts Kapoor upstairs. Anil pulls a gun on Kashyap. Harsh wants to do a movie with Kashyap and comes into Anil's room to pitch his idea to Kashyap. It takes some time for Anil to get rid of Harsh. While Anil & Anurag fight, the masked man severs Sonam's finger, so Kapoor relents. Anil is willing pay Anurag, but Anurag sticks to his script and says Anil has 7 hours left to find Sonam and prove to the world that he is still the big Hero that he claims to be.\n\nAnil resumes his search for the cab driver, asking all cab drivers he can find on the streets. With 4 hours to go, eventually, a cab driver directs him to a Christmas celebration (in exchange for Anil's Rolex that Harsh had gifted him that very night), where Kapoor finds the driver, Javed, through the viewfinder. Kapoor chases him through and around Mumbai Central before a car hits Anil. Bloodied, Kapoor breaks down in front of the camera, regretting his absence as a father and begging Yogita for any information. Kashyap, having slowed down due to his asthma, finally arrives to taunt Kapoor and make him continue. At another Christmas celebration, Kapoor has to dance for the crowd until someone tells him where Javed lives, where they finally capture him.\n\nJaved directs them to where he was told to take Sonam; however, Kashyap insists that Javed is lying and that his own house was not part of the script. They end up arriving at Kashyap's house with 2 hours to sunrise, where another video-call shows Sonam is in his DVD room. When they get in, Sonam is gone and Kashyap's parents have also been abducted. After a struggle between the trio (Anurag hits Yogita to find out what is going on), Anurag receives a video call with Sonam and his parents as hostages. Now, Anurag is warned with the same 4 rules that he gave Anil. Kashyap reveals the original hostage site (United Mills in Byculla), and they go there. A mysterious masked man with another camera shows at the mill, but they don't find anyone else as the sun rises and time runs out.\n\nAlthough Kashyap repeatedly claims that these events weren't in his script, Kapoor discovers a copy and forces him to read it, which states that Kashyap intentionally diverted him, then planned to take a gun from his bag and force Kapoor to choose between killing himself or Kashyap with it. Kapoor interrogates an increasingly agitated Kashyap with the aforementioned gun and accidentally shoots him.\n\nThe perspective shifts to the third person as Kapoor and Yogita drive Kashyap to the hospital. Sonam and Kashyap's parents are later found in the basement of Kashyap's society, with Kashyap being charged for their kidnapping. The media speculates that Anurag wanted to force Anil to work in his movie, as Anurag had not delivered a hit for many years. As he lays in his hospital bed, Kapoor reveals that he had actually planned everything: angered at Kashyap's comments, he convinced Yogita after the panel show to help frame Kashyap in exchange for a break into the industry and conspired alongside his family to make most of the dramatic turns happen, with Harshvardhan having purposely hit him with the car. Kashyap is sentenced for 8 to 15 years in prison, and Anil is deemed to have shot him in self-defense.\n\nMonths later, the resulting film (Once Upon A Time in Bollywood) nets some Filmfare Awards for Yogita (as director) and Kapoor, while a deranged Kashyap plots vengeance from a mental asylum"

Sheriff Joel Armstrong (Collin Brock) picks him up and they go to check it out. They find an abandoned caravan close to where the object crashed. As they discover the object and realize it is a spaceship, an Alien emerges. The Alien (resembling a giant spider with a lizarz-like head and torso) then chases them, after which Lee flees to the car. However Armstrong makes a stand, trips, falls and is killed by the Alien that then leaves. A terrified Tammy finds Lee and they call the local authorities but their car is destroyed by the Alien.\n\nThey run to a local caf\u00e9 where they meet Hilary, Javier, Figgus and Marcy who do not believe them.

    "AVP: Alien vs. Predator": "In 2004, a satellite detects a mysterious heat bloom beneath Bouvetoya, an island about one thousand miles off the coast of Antarctica. Wealthy industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) discovers through thermal imaging that there is a pyramid buried 2000 feet beneath the ice. He attempts to claim it for his multinational communications company, Weyland Industries, a subsidiary of the Weyland Corporation, and assembles a team of experts to investigate. The team includes archaeologists, linguistic experts, drillers, mercenaries, and a guide named Alexa Woods (Sanaa Lathan).\n\nAs a Predator ship reaches Earth's orbit, it fires a beam that creates a passage through the ice towards the source of the heat bloom. When the team arrives at the abandoned whaling station above the heat source, they find the passage and descend beneath the ice. They locate the mysterious pyramid and begin to explore it, finding evidence of a prehistoric civilization and what appears to be a sacrificial chamber filled with human skeletons with ruptured rib cages.\n\nMeanwhile, three Predators arrive and kill all the humans on the surface. They make their way down to the pyramid and arrive just as the team unwittingly activates the structure. The Alien Queen awakes from cryogenic stasis and begins to produce eggs. When the eggs hatch, several face-Huggers attach themselves to humans trapped in the sacrificial chamber. Chest-Bursters emerge from the humans and quickly grow into adult Aliens. Conflict erupts between the Predators, Aliens, and humans, resulting in several deaths. Two Predators are killed by an Alien, and Weyland is killed by the remaining Predator, while allowing Alexa and archaeologist Sebastian De Rosa (Raoul Bova) enough time to escape. The two witness the Predator kill a face-Hugger and an Alien with a Suriken before unmasking and marking himself with the blood of the face-Hugger. After Alexa and Sebastian leave, another face-Hugger attaches itself to the unmasked Predator.\n\nThrough translation of the pyramid's hieroglyphs, Alexa and Sebastian learn that the Predators have been visiting Earth for thousands of years. It was they who taught early human civilizations how to build pyramids and were worshiped as gods. Every 100 years they would visit Earth to take part in a rite of passage in which several humans would sacrifice themselves as hosts for the Aliens, creating the \"ultimate prey\" for the Predators to hunt. If overwhelmed, the Predators would activate a self-destruct device to eliminate the Aliens and themselves. The two deduce that this is why the current Predators are at the pyramid, and that the heat bloom was to attract humans for the sole purpose of making new Aliens to hunt.\n\nAlexa and Sebastian decide that the Predators must be allowed to succeed in their hunt so that the Aliens \"do not reach the surface\". Unfortunately, Sebastian is captured by an Alien, leaving only Alexa and the Predator to fight against the Aliens. The two form an alliance and use a self-destruct device to destroy the pyramid and the remaining Aliens. Alexa and Scar reach the surface, where they battle the Alien Queen. They defeat the Queen by attaching its chain to a water tower and pushing her over a cliff, dragging the Queen to the ocean floor. Scar, however, is impaled through the torso by the Alien Queen's tail and succumbs to his wounds and dies.\n\nA Predator ship uncloaks, and several Predators appear. They retrieve their fallen comrade, and an elite Predator presents Alexa with one of their spear weapons in recognition of her skill as a warrior. As the Predators retreat into space, a chest-Burster with a hybrid form of an Alien and a Predator erupts from Scar's chest, beginning the events of Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem."

    "Aachi and Ssipak": "Aachi and Ssipak are two hoodlums earning a dishonest living in an energy depleted future dystopia; they hold up bathroom stalls where people are trying to have \"sincere\" bowel movements, as the energy source of tomorrow is human excrement. All citizens are implanted with anal identity chips at birth, and when they defecate in public stalls they receive an addictive, hallucinogenic popsicle called a \"juicybar\" as a reward.\n\nJuicybars, of course, cause people to transform into small, blue, and stupid mutants. These mutants have been organized by a Hitleresque charismatic leader into a revolutionary cell called \"The Diaper Gang\" and they are constantly hounded by police forces, aided by an unstoppable government cyborg. Everyone wants to control the juicybar supply, including the two aforementioned anti-heroes, who always manage to be in the right place at the wrong time despite their general ineptitude (or perhaps because of it).\n\nThrough a comedy of errors, Jimmy the Freak, a drug-addled porn director, stumbles onto a means of tricking the system into over-dispensing juicybars and he hands this information to the leader of the Diapers. They then recruit anti-heroine Beauty (a woman imbued with the power to crap several times a day) to be the vessel for a \"blessed\" anal chip and soon accidentally lose her to Aachi and Ssipak (the latter of whom has fallen in love with her from afar).\n\nMuch of the movie is then a chase scene where Beauty exchanges hands again and again; and ultimately she ends up in the possession of the Diapers. They use her power to change the tide to their favor, forcing the government's hand and causing them to enlist the help of the deranged creator of cyborgs (who ends up in the hands of the Diapers anyway and creates mutant cyborgs for their side too). The conflict escalates into a titanic battle at a desert fortress, where Aachi and Ssipak sneak in and do their best to retrieve Beauty, causing another series of chase scenes.\n\nIn the end, the anti-heroes survive by outlasting all the other forces and outrunning a series of ever-intensifying explosions, and ride off into the sunset to poop another day."

    "Aakrosh": "It's supposedly based on a true story which is yet to be substantiated. Three friends from Delhi go missing in a small village - Jhanjhar. It's two months and there is no clue about their disappearance. The media and students movement demand action from the authorities. It's then that the government orders a CBI inquiry with officers Sidhant Chaturvedi (Akshaye Khanna) and Pratap Kumar (Ajay Devgn) to solve the case. They find it difficult to solve the case as the local police and other authorities are a part of Shool Sena, which is responsible for illicit activities. Sidhant and Pratap also face Ajatshatru Singh (Paresh Rawal), a ruthless police officer who misuses his power & thwarts the investigation at every step. Not only that even the locals don't support the investigation. One of the boys Dinu had relatives in the village & had come to visit his sister Jamunia (Reema Sen) & her hubby Rukmilaal with his 2 friends for Dusshera. But Jamunia and Rukmilaal deny that the boys ever came to Jhanjhar. That night Rukmilaal is kidnapped.\n\nThey find the car used by the 3 men in the local river & its clear someone wanted to make it look like an accident. Sidhant figures the car was lowered into the water by crane. As Pratap & Sidhant make headway, they are attacked by members of Shool Sena, who Pratap explains are the local mafia. Sidhant is able to track the owner of the crane, & is about to capture when him when his is run down by a man in the jeep. The same man is later found in police station & Pratap refuses to hand him over to Sidhant and Pratap. It's with the help of Roshni (Amita Pathak) who's the daughter of a rich and powerful villager Omkar Sukur (who was a minister & is now the strong-man & controls the administration), and Geeta (Bipasha Basu), who's Ajatshatru's wife and Pratap's former love, that the investigation moves ahead. Roshni's SIM was found in the car that was recovered. Sidhant has to call police force from Delhi to arrest Roshni, when Omkar refuses to hand her over.\n\nGeeta was the daughter of Pratap's teacher & both fell in love. But Geeta's father pleads Pratap to leave her alone as Pratap is from untouchable caste & if he marries Geeta, no one will marry the teacher's other 2 girls. Roshni reveals that Dinu (a Dalit) loved her & she hoped that him getting admission into Delhi medical college would get him to accepted by her ultra conservative family. But her dad refused & arranged her marriage. Thats when Dinu came to the village with 2 friends to elope with Roshni & rescue her. They escape in a car but are intercepted by police & Omkar's men & Roshni is taken away. She reveals that Ajatshatru & another man Sethu were on the scene. Sidhant files a case in court but it falls apart due to lack of direct evidence (bodies of the 3 boys, & Roshni's failure to identify Ajatshatru in a lineup). Its clear that the judge is in cahoots with Police & Omkar.\n\nDinu was a Dalit & his community protests, with a march, which is brutally broken up by police. That night a mob attacks the Dalit village, led by Shool Sena & helped with a blind eye from police. Jhamunia's son is killed in the attack & she is distraught. CBI pulls up Sidhant for turning the case into a communal riot & asks him to wrap up the investigation. Jhamunia is Geeta's friend & Geeta finally cracks when she sees the woman who has lost her brother, husband and son. Geeta convinces Jhamunia to talk to Pratap & tell him the truth, but Jhamunia is kidnapped. Sidhant & Pratap follow, but find Jhamunia on the roadside with her tongue cutoff.\n\nThe suspense behind the missing three friends is revealed by Geeta who witnessed the killing of these boys by Omkar helped by her husband Ajatshatru. Ajatshatru had brought the 3 boys back home where first Omkar kills Dinu & then Ajatshatru kills the 2 friends as they were sons of powerful people in Delhi who would have revealed everything if they escaped. Geeta witnessed this from behind a door. CBI finds the bodies based on her testimony.\n\nAjatshatru comes to know about her wife Geeta helping CBI. He then beats Geeta brutally with his belt behind closed doors and leaves her hospitalized. Pratap, filled with anger, traps each of the criminals by hacking their respective phone's databases and capturing their illicit activities on CCTV cameras. When it is Ajatshatru's turn, Pratap cuts him with a sharp razor and beats him brutally and mercilessly in a saloon behind closed doors. They also entice one of the henchmen to become their witness by convincing Shool Sena that he is already working for them. Shool Sena attacks the henchman & drives him straight to Pratap At the end all the criminals are killed by Jhamunia (Reema Sen) after they are sentenced by the court. She was given the weapon by Sidhant."

    "Aan: Men at Work": "Crime is at its highest peak in Mumbai with it split in three ways. Gautam Walia (Jackie Shroff) (Roshni Varma (Raveena Tandon) is Gautam's mistress), a ruthless businessman has one-third, Manik Rao (Manoj Joshi), the Home Minister has one-third and Yusuf Pathan (Irrfan Khan), a big-time goon (he runs money lending, extortion and protection businesses in Mumbai) has a third of the territory. The trio warns Raghu Shetty (Ravi Kishan) not to interfere with their business. Raghu is trying to make it big in Mumbai and wants to corner a territory, but the only way he can do that is by killing one of the trio. Raghu pays no heed to their warning and ambushes Walia at a horse derby. Walia is alive, but Pathan kills Shetty's man who carried on the hit. Shetty is then jailed. Hirachand Mehta (Vallabh Vyas) is a businessman and launders money for Walia and Manik. The trio are very powerful and even have HC judge (Aanjjan Srivastav) on their payroll who delivers favorable verdicts towards them. The crime rate rises with more smuggling, trading and illegal activities soaring. Meanwhile, the Detection Unit cops of the Mumbai Crime Branch work constantly to stop this.\n\nSenior Inspector Vikram Singh (Shatrughan Sinha), who was a hero once upon a time in the crime department, now tends to handle the easy jobs. Inspector Appa Kadam Naik (Sunil Shetty) is an encounter specialist who goes after the henchmen instead of the bosses; he is married to Janki (Preeti Jhangiani) and they have a son named Rahul. Naik has recently encountered a few of Pathan's men, working with Vikram. Head Constable Khaled Ansari (Paresh Rawal) is a happy-go-lucky cop and chews betel leaf all the time. Kelkar (Ajinkya Deo) is another cop who talks on the phone all the time. The four men's and the whole CBI's fate changes with the arrival of their new boss.\n\nDCP Hari Om Patnaik (Akshay Kumar) arrives and realizes that the other cops are not serious and that no one is following the rules and regulations. Om has a girlfriend, Kiran (Lara Dutta), whom he promises to marry. He is hesitant about his promotion (he was in Pune state police and was on the verge on busting a large fake currency racket, when he was promoted and transferred) as he thinks that this promotion is done deliberately to kick him out, but he learns to accept it. He witnesses the way the others treat the henchmen (Vikram and Naik were in the process of beating some arrested goons when Om walked in on them) and orders them to be released. Om wants criminals to be treated like humans, but Naik disagrees saying that Pathan's shooters show no such mercy in response. Khaled and Vikram try to explain to Om that the system had tied the hands of policemen in Mumbai, but Om is unwilling to do anything that doesn't follow proper procedure. When Naik goes on his encounter, the news reaches Pathan via Kelkar (who is a snitch), who calls Walia, who calls Manik, who calls DCP Khurrana (Om Puri), who asks Om to shut Naik down. Om doesn't agree with Naik's strategy of eliminating the small fry, he wants to go after the big fish, but with process. He demonstrates this to his staff by facing Yusuf Pathan and showing him that he is just a mere street hoodlum.\n\nManik wants industrialist Pradhan (Milind Gunaji) to support his party. Pradhan is a vocal supporter of the opposition and supplies funding to them, which is used to bought MLAs in the government. Manik wants Walia to handle Pradhan, but when Pradhan refuses, Manik asks Yusuf Pathan to \"influence\" Pradhan. Pradhan insults Pathan calling him a 2 bit black movie ticket seller. Yusuf's brother Baba kills Pradhan on the spot. Om is handling the Pradhan case. He gets a tip on Baba's presence at a bar. Kelkar informs Yusuf that a raid is imminent. Yusuf sends his men to save Baba, and the henchmen kill Khaled (Kelkar helps Baba escape). Khaled is killed by the same shooters that Om released a few days earlier. Naik is livid and says Khaled's death is on Om and nobody else. Om also wants revenge.\n\nVikram decides to join Om and Appa and help him clear the city starting with Yusuf Pathan's younger brother, Baba \"Yeda\" Pathan (Rahul Dev) by killing him. They trap Baba when he goes to meet his film-star mistress at her apartment. Kelkar warns Yusuf about the raid, but Yusuf is not able to reach there on time. Yusuf orders an attack on Naik's family and his wife is shot. After this DCP Khurrana (Om Puri) gives Om a free hand to go after the gangs. After that, they arrest Yusuf Pathan, which puts a halt to small-time criminal activities in Mumbai. Simultaneously, Raghu Shetty replaces Pathan to run the illegal businesses on behalf of Manik and Walia. When Yusuf finds out he agrees to cooperate with the police.\n\nNaik dies in a trap set by Kelkar. Naik records a conversation between Walia and Hirachand and goes to pursue them, but Kelkar warns them off and Naik is encountered by their shooters & Raghu. Vikram and Om track Raghu Shetty and a illicit currency trader named Hirachand Mehta (Vallabh Vyas) at the Flying Club with the help of a tip given by Roshni Varma (Raveena Tandon) to Vikram. Roshi was pissed with Walia as he beat her black and blue when she attended Naik's funeral. The police try to block the plane at the runway, but to no use. Finally, Om damages the left wing and the back engine of the plane with a helicopter. The plane crashes into a hangar. Shetty and his goons try to escape, but are killed. Vikram kills Shetty. Hirachand is arrested and Kelkar's corrupt actions are caught by Vikram and Om. If left alive, he will be bailed out by the lawyers, so Vikram shoots him.\n\nThe arguments in the court are in the favor of Walia and his men. During the break, Vikram and Om threaten the corrupt judge (Aanjjan Srivastav) to change his judgment by presenting Yusuf in front of him. Yusuf will expose him if the judgment is not fair. The judgment is in favor of the police and the case is closed. DCP Khurrana (Om Puri), Om and Vikram walk out of the courtroom happily. Hari says that Mumbai is crime free. Vikram then shows a list of gangsters that had to be encountered by Appaa, to which Om agrees. He then meets Kiran who says that she is proud of him."

    "Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne Lage": "Sapna (Ameesha Patel) is the only daughter of a wealthy underworld Don, Pratap Dholakia (Kiran Kumar). She lives in terror of her father and brother Raman's (Mukesh Tiwari) tyranny, violence, and dangerous gang associations. Due to their numerous enemies, they have kept Sapna confined at home all her life with only her sister-in-law, Nisha (Nishigandha Wad), for company and comfort. Highly sheltered, naive, and lonely, Sapna longs to break free.\n\nOne night Sapna attends her childhood friend's wedding without her father's permission, and on the drive home is attacked by Pratap's rival gang. Rohit (Hrithik Roshan), a local college student, witnesses the attack and protects Sapna. They immediately fall in love with each other, but before they can introduce themselves she is rescued by Pratap's men. Livid, Pratap forbids Sapna from ever leaving the house again.\n\nThe next morning, Rohit obtains Sapna's name from a newspaper article about the incident. He and his friends manage to enter her home as a musical band, performing for the Navaratri dance celebrations. Sparks fly between him and Sapna over the nine nights of Navaratri and they start meeting secretly. Although Raman is suspicious, Rohit charms Pratap and earns his trust when Sapna explains that he was the one who had saved her on the night of the gang attack. Rohit gives Sapna the phone number of his hostel's canteen and they start talking. He meets her at the roof of her house, all alone and they proclaim their love for each other. Rohit sneaks Sapna out for excursions around town (Movies, dumb charades) and takes her home to meet his parents, who receive her lovingly. Nisha discovers their relationship, warning Sapna of Pratap's cruelty and what he and Raman would do to Rohit if they found out. In the meantime, Pratap, thinking that Sapna would be safest abroad, arranges for her to marry the son of a wealthy friend who lives in London. He announces their engagement on the last night of Navaratri in front of all guests, shocking both Sapna and Rohit.\n\nSapna ends her relationship with Rohit to protect him from her father and brother. Nisha secretly visits Rohit at his boys' college to explain, begging him to forget Sapna. Undeterred, on the night of Sapna's engagement party, Rohit whisks her away to his hostel, reasoning that it would be the last place Pratap would search for her. With the help of his friends (and, soon, all the boys in the college. Initially the hostel mates are angry that Rohit decided to put all of them in danger. But they all agree to let Sapna stay after hearing her side of the story), Sapna is disguised as a male student and settles in happily, tasting freedom for the first time. Meanwhile, Pratap assumes that Sapna has been abducted by his rival, Kania Pathan (Shahbaz Khan), and Raman executes a violent search for her, mercilessly attacking Kania Pathan's men and territory. When this proves futile, Pratap has his telephone bill checked and notices frequent calls to and from an unfamiliar phone number, which happens to be Rohit's.\n\nRaman and his men arrive at Rohit's hostel, intending to retrieve Sapna by force. In defense, a hundred of Rohit's peers arrive carrying sticks and bats, showing solidarity with Rohit and Sapna. Before a fight can ensue, Pratap appears and publicly berates Raman for coming to the hostel without his permission. He earnestly displays fatherly concern, declaring his approval of Rohit and Sapna's relationship and convincing Sapna to return home with him to prepare for her wedding to Rohit.\n\nBursting with joy, Sapna arrives back home and tells Nisha of her father's acceptance. Dismayed, Nisha reveals that Pratap deceived Sapna to avoid creating a scene at the hostel, and that her father's pride is more valuable to him than Sapna's happiness. Heartbroken, Sapna pleads with Pratap, who furiously informs her that she is to fly to London that very night. Under the guise of peace, Pratap summons Rohit to his factory, revealing his true intentions. When Rohit refuses to give up Sapna, Pratap orders Raman and his men to kill Rohit. They brutally beat Rohit and toss him in a gully, thinking that he was dead. Sapna overhears Pratap speaking of Rohit's death and overdoses on pills, intending to kill herself. She leaves a suicide note in her room and, before leaving for the airport, informs her father that he has crushed her so much that she wishes to go to be with her (long deceased) mother. After Sapna leaves, Nisha finds her suicide note and throws it at Pratap, screaming at him for selfishly killing his own daughter.\n\nAs Raman and his men escort Sapna to the airport, Rohit appears, bloodied and enraged. With renewed strength, he fights them off just as Sapna starts coughing up blood, succumbing to her overdose. He professes his love for her and gets her to a hospital, where she is treated and stabilized. The film concludes with Pratap, emotional and humbled, silently hugging Rohit for saving Sapna's life again and giving the couple his blessing."

    "Aayirathil Oruvan": "In 1279 A.D. the downfall of the Chola dynasty seems imminent as the Pandyas drive the Chola people out of their kingdom in southern India. To escape them and save the life of his successor the Chola emperor sends his son along with the Chola people to a secret territory. The refugees take along an idol sacred to the Pandyas, angering them. To capture the escaped Cholas and the stolen idol, the Pandyas extend their invasion to unexplored territories but cannot find them.\n\nCenturies later, in 2009, Indian archaeologists continue searching for the existence of the lost Chola group based on clues left by the ancient Pandyan warriors. All archaeologists who attempted to search for the secret land have disappeared. Archaeologist Chandramouli is the most recent person to have gone missing.\n\nThe Indian government organizes a search expedition led by officer Anitha to find Chandramouli and the Chola empire; she is assisted by the Indian army led by Ravisekharan. They recruit archaeologist Lavanya, the estranged daughter of Chandramouli, because her insight is essential for the success of the expedition. She hands over crucial documents on the Chola dynasty, prepared by her father, with instructions on the route to reach the destination.\n\nAlong with the army, Anitha employs a group of porters headed by Muthu, to transport the baggage during the journey. The crew embark on their voyage leading them to an island, Min-gua, near Vietnam. They face seven traps set by the Cholas: sea creatures, cannibals, warriors, snakes, hunger, quicksand and a village. Many porters and army men are killed by these traps.\n\nMuthu, Anitha and Lavanya get separated from the others. They reach the ruins of a village where they are subjected to black magic and nearly go mad before reaching the secret hideout of the Chola. The three find an ethnic isolated primitive Tamil group, ruled by a Chola king. The king and his people are in hiding, awaiting the arrival of the fabled messenger who will bring glory and prosperity back to their land and lead them back to Thanjavur, their motherland. The king and the priest consult the gods for omens and order Muthu, Anitha and Lavanya to be burnt alive as sacrifices.\n\nAnitha tells the king that she is the messenger sent from the homeland. Muthu and Lavanya are enslaved while Anitha is given a chance to prove herself. She tries to seduce and convince the Chola king to march towards the homeland in two days so he can be crowned a proper king. He suspects whether she is legitimate since none of Anitha's actions match ancestor's description. The ancestors wrote that the messenger will be preceded by hail and following his ill-treatment will eventually help the tribe.\n\nMeanwhile, Anitha drugs the priest and poisons the water sources. She catches a glimpse of the Pandyas' sacred idol and leaves, finally exposing her identity as a descendant of the Pandya Dynasty. For generations, her race has been trying to find the whereabouts of the Chola prince and his people. The central minister, who sponsors the expedition, is also shown to be a Pandyan. The Chola king is shattered for having believed in Anitha to be his true messenger. Anitha and Ravishekaran gather an army and assault the hidden kingdom. The king discover Muthu is the true messenger who would save the Cholas from the clutches of Anitha and the army.\n\nThe Cholas fight bravely, but eventually lose and are taken prisoners. Their women are molested and raped by the army, the king is killed and the men drown in the seas. Muthu is able to escape and save the Chola prince. The seed of the Chola dynasty is brought back to India by the messenger as prophesied."

    "Abduction": "Nathan (Taylor Lautner) is a high schooler in Pennslyvania, who likes parties and boxing with his dad. He has rage and self-identity issues, and sees a shink (Sigourney Weaver). He's apparently a good wrestler as well as a kickboxer. He's assigned to work on a school project with his neighbor, Karen (Lily Collins), who he's sweet on, but too shy to talk to. They find a website for missing children, and, aging one online, see a likeness of Nathan. He contacts the site, and it triggers an alert in New York. The tech on duty (Nickola Shreli) in New York activates a trace and Nathan's webcam and send a photo of Nathan to a Mr Kozlow (Michael Nyqvist).\n\nHe takes some old pictures to his friend Gilly (Allen Williamson), who thinks they are suspicious. He confronts his mother (Maria Bello), who fortunately gets killed by operatives before she can explain. His father (Jason Isaacs) fights off one operative, but is killed as well, and Nathan runs away. He comes back to save Karen and defeats the armed operative, who tells him there's a bomb in the kitchen. Naturally, Nathan goes to look, and there's 7 seconds left! He and Karen run outside and leap into the pool as the house and operative are destroyed.\n\nKaren is hurt, so Nathan takes her to the hospital. We see Mr. Kozlow arrive in country, and he gets undressed in a car. In the hospital, Nathan calls 911 about his parents murdered but the operator told him to hold the line and the call connects to Frank Burton (Alfred Molina) of CIA, who tells him to stay put, and Kozlow's goons apparently have the pay phone tapped! His shrink, Dr. Bennett, uses balloons to hide Nathan from the hospital cameras, which everyone has tapped into as well. In a car escaping, Dr. Bennett explains that she's with the CIA, and Burton can't be trusted. She tells him it's ok to trust Martin Price or Paul Rasmus, but doesn't explain why. She also gives him keys to a safe house in Virginia. They leap from the car and Dr. Bennett's car is destroyed. By this time, if you're not completely dazed, you realize Nathan is some kind of important kid, with secret skills.\n\nNathan and Karen wake up in the woods, completely refreshed and clean. Burton briefs a bunch of constipated agents about Martin Price, who is Nathan's real father, and has stolen data from Kozlow. Burton's boss tells him to get things under control. Nathan and Karen hitchhike to the safe house, where he finds a gun, a phone with encrypted text and some photos, who he recognizes as his mother. Karen makes a phone call, and apparently all of her relatives' phone lines are tapped too.\n\nNathan's father left a BMW, and Nathan/Karen go looking for his mother, finding her grave. They find fresh flowers on the grave, and the cemetary operator tells them the flowers came from Paul Rasmus. The bad guys and the CIA intercept the cemetary computer query, even though it's not on the internet, and magically conjure an image of the BMW, apparently from the cemetary's high-resolution cameras. Nathan and Karen meet Gilly, who gets them fake IDs. They buy train tickets, but the bad guys have spotted the BMW and followed them to the train station.\n\nOn the train, Karen asks if they are going to die, and Nathan says no. They kiss and start to grope, but stop because they're hungry? Karen goes to get food without him, and guess what happens next - the bad guys get her! Nathan, who has gone looking for Karen, meets the bad guy and they fight. Nathan manages to beat a grown, trained operative and Karen escapes her bondage with a piece of broken glass. Nathan shatters the train window and throws the bad guy out. The train stops, perhaps to investigate, and they exit the train. At this point, you're hoping the movie is over, but there's still 30 minutes left!\n\nNatah and Karen stroll through the woods, and the CIA chases them. Burton convinces them to trust him and buys them burgers, while about 100 agents protect them. Burton explains things, and Kozlow's bad guys start killing the CIA guys. Nathan realizes the phone has the text his father stole, and that Burton's name is on in the text. The bad guys attack the diner. During the attack, Nathan and Karen escape, and since Nathan doesn't trust Burton he tells Karen about the list. Of course, Kozlow can hear them and track them, so he calls the phone in the car and threatens all of Nathan's friends and arranges a meet. Meanwhile, the CIA raids Kozlow's hideout and kills his goons. They also find a recording of the conversation between Nathan and Kozlow, detailing the meet at PNC park in Pittsburgh.\n\nAt the park, Martin calls Nathan and tells him not to go through with the meet. Nathan hangs up on him. Karen gets a photo of Kozlow and sends it to Nathan. They sit beside each other, and apparently, Gilly has taped a gun under Nathan's seat! Kozlow tells Nathan that his parents were awful people, and Nathan chooses to believe him. We relive Nathan's mother's death at the hands of Kozlow, and even at age 2, Nathan was a super-spy! Kozlow gets Nathan's gun, then chases him through the park. Nathan demonstrates his parkour abilities, and Martin calls him to tell him to lead Kozlow into a trap. Kozlow has time to see Martin hidden as a sniper about 500 yards away, and has time to yell before getting shot. Burton's boss arrives and take the phone, telling Burton he has lots to answer for. The CIA lets Nathan go, and Martin calls one last time to say goodbye. Karen and Nathan reunite, and Dr. Bennett arrives as well. She tells Nathan he can live with her, and Nathan/Karen stroll off, promising to go to Dr. Bennett's house (even though she never gave an address - apparently, Nathan can figure that out, too).\n\nNathan and Karen sit in the now-empty stadium and make out."

    "Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies": "In 1819 Kentucky, after his mother Nancy Lincoln (Rhianna Van Helton), falls victim to an illness that requires her to be tied to her bed, vicious and cannibalistic, 10-year-old Abe Lincoln (Brennen Harper) sees his father Thomas Lincoln (Kent Igleheart) commit suicide at her bedside. Taking up a weapon, the distraught young Abe tells his mother that he loves her before beheading her. He then joins others in his community in containing a local zombie outbreak.\n\nIn August 1863, when an adult Abraham Lincoln (Bill Oberst Jr.) has become President of a fracturing United States, he is apprised of rumors concerning a prominent Confederate stronghold. He is told that a regiment of 30 men had gone to Confederate Fort Pulaski to seize it from the Confederates and only one man returned barely alive. When questioning the survivor, Lincoln discovers the soldier has an illness that seems to bring corpses back to life. He then personally leads a team of the newly established Secret Service to accompany him in investigating the fort in the Deep South.\n\nThey get to the fort and are attacked by Confederate survivers led by the one-armed General Thomas 'Stonewall' Jackson (Don McGraw) (who did not die at the battle of Chancelorville but just lost his right arm) as well as by several of the infected people. Abe kills one of his men who had been bitten by an infected and explains to the others in his party that if they are bitten or scratched by an infected, or if an infected's blood makes contact with their mouths or eyes, that they too will become infected and, within 24 hours, would no longer be considered \"human\". More are lost when attempting to investigate the surrounding neighborhood, and Abe encounters an old flame turned prostitute Mary Owens (Baby Norman) who is sheltering her help, including a young Theodore Roosevelt (Canon Kuipers), to protect them from the invasion.\n\nThe group makes their way back to the fort where Jackson refuses to kill the infected, believing them to only be sick and in need of care. He claims Lincoln's actions are only against the members of the confederacy. Based on an old word he'd learned from his mother, the negro Agent Brown (Jason Hughley) names the infected persons \"zombies\", or \"the walking dead\" that need to feed on human flesh. Sgt. Pat Garrett (Christopher Marrone), one of Jackson's men, volunteers to help Abe, and guides them to a nearby plantation that has farming implements they can use to combat the threat.\n\nWhen returning to the fort, Mary is splashed in the face with zombie blood and soon falls ill. Meanwhile, agent John Wilkinson (Jason Vail) plots to kill Lincoln while he's alone. He recants when he catches Abe praying, as in his mind prayer would ensure Lincoln's soul going to heaven. The next morning, Wilkinson remains behind at the fort as the rest of the group heads into the township to kill off the infected. Being greatly outnumbered, only Abe, Theodore and Mary's friend Annika (Anna Fricks) return when the others are slaughtered and eaten alive. After finally realizing that Lincoln is right and escape is unlikley, Stonewall shows Abe a cache of gunpowder. They they decide to use the explosive to blow up the fort after trapping and containing the zombies inside.\n\nJackson blows the Revelle on his trumpet, luring all of the zombies into the fort where Abe lights the fuse to the powder magazine. When the fuse goes out, Stonewall ventures down alone to re-light it, but is over-run and killed by the zombies just after doing so. Abe and Brown escape just in time and the entire place goes up. Mary accepts her fate and goes off with Lincoln to die, much to Annika's heartbreak. Abe then ventures to Gettsyburg to deliver the Gettsyburg Address in the dedication of the local cemetery.\n\n18 months later, Abe goes to visit Mary who had been in the care of a doctor investigating the illness in vain hope of finding a cure. As Abe cleans wounds caused by her restraining shackles, Mary grabs his hand scratches his skin infecting him, much to his horror. Knowing he is himself uncurable, Abe requests that a message be sent to John Wilkinson, as earlier he'd discovered that Wilkinson was actually John Wilkes Booth who had a plot to kidnap Lincoln in response to the end of the war and the Union the victor. The message gives Booth the information to know exactly where Lincoln would be the following night as Abe and his wife Mary go to Ford Theater... thus leading to his assassination at Booth's hands."

    "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter": "In 1818, Abraham Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) lives with his parents, Nancy (Robin McLeavy) and Thomas (Joseph Mawle), who work at a plantation owned by Jack Barts (Marton Csokas). There, Lincoln befriends a young African American boy, William Johnson (Anthony Mackie), and intervenes when he sees Johnson being beaten by an overseer. Because of his son's actions, Thomas is fired. That night, Lincoln sees Barts break into his house and attack Nancy. She dies shortly afterwards. Thomas tells Lincoln that Barts poisoned Nancy.\n\nNine years later, a vengeful Lincoln attacks Barts at the docks, but Barts, who is actually a vampire, overpowers him. However, before Barts can kill him, Lincoln is rescued by Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper). Sturgess explains that vampires exist, and offers to teach Lincoln to be a vampire hunter. Lincoln accepts and, after a decade of training, travels to Springfield, Illinois. During his training, Sturgess tells Lincoln that the vampires in America descend from Adam (Rufus Sewell), a vampire who owns a plantation in New Orleans with his sister, Vadoma (Erin Wasson). Sturgess also tells Lincoln of the vampires' weakness, silver, and presents him with a silver pocket watch.\n\nIn Springfield, Lincoln befriends shopkeeper Joshua Speed (Jimmi Simpson), and meets Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Though Sturgess warned him not to form any close relationships, Lincoln develops romantic feelings for Mary.\n\nLincoln successfully finds and defeats Barts. Before dying, Barts reveals that Sturgess is also a vampire. Lincoln confronts Sturgess, who reveals that, many years ago, he and his wife were attacked and bitten by Adam. She died because her soul was pure, but because Sturgess' was impure, he became a vampire, and that prevented him from harming Adam or any other vampire (since \"Only the living can kill the dead\"). Sturgess has since been training vampire hunters, hoping to destroy Adam.\n\nDisappointed, Lincoln decides to abandon his mission. However, Adam learns of his activities and kidnaps Johnson to lure Lincoln into a trap at his plantation. Adam captures Lincoln and tries to recruit him, revealing his plans to turn the United States into a nation of the Undead. Speed rescues his friends, and they escape to Ohio.\n\nLincoln marries Mary and begins his political career, campaigning to abolish slavery. Sturgess warns Lincoln that the slave trade keeps vampires under control, as vampires use slaves for food, and if Lincoln interferes, the vampires will retaliate. After Lincoln's election as President of the United States of America, he moves to the White House with Mary, where they have a son, William Wallace Lincoln (Cameron M. Brown). William is later bitten by Vadoma and dies.\n\nConfederate President Jefferson Davis (John Rothman) convinces Adam to deploy his vampires on the front lines. Lincoln orders the confiscation of all the silverware in the area and has it melted to produce silver weapons. Speed, believing that Lincoln is tearing the nation apart, defects and informs Adam that Lincoln will transport the silver by train.\n\nOn the train, Adam and Vadoma, who have set fire to the upcoming trestle, attack Lincoln, Sturgess, and Johnson. During the fight Adam learns that the train holds only rocks. Speed reveals that his betrayal was a ruse to lure Adam into a trap, and Adam kills Speed for this. Lincoln wraps his silver watch around his fist and punches through Adam's chest, killing him, and Lincoln escapes the exploding train alongside his allies. Meanwhile, Mary and the ex-slaves have transported the silver to Gettysburg through the Underground Railroad - it is here that Vadoma is killed by Mary.\n\nThe now leaderless Confederate vampires stage a final, massive assault and are met head on by the Union. Armed with their silver weapons, the Union soldiers destroy the vampires and eventually win the war. Nearly two years later, on April 14, 1865, Sturgess tells Lincoln that the remaining vampires have fled the country. Sturgess tries to convince Lincoln to allow him to turn Lincoln into a vampire, so that he can become immortal and continue to fight vampires, but Lincoln declines and leaves for the theater with his wife, apparently implying he is soon to be assassinated by John Wilkes Booth. In modern times, Sturgess approaches a man at a bar in Washington, D.C. as he once approached Lincoln."

    "Absolute Power": "During the course of a burglary At Walter's house, master jewel thief Luther Whitney (Clint Eastwood) witnesses the killing of Christy Sullivan (Melora Hardin), the beautiful young wife of elderly billionaire Walter Sullivan (E. G. Marshall), during her drunken rendezvous with Alan Richmond (Gene Hackman), the President of the United States. Walter Sullivan is Richmond's friend and financial supporter.\n\nHiding behind a one-way mirror, Luther watches as Richmond becomes sexually violent towards Christy when he playfully slaps her across the face. When she retaliates by slapping him back, Richmond becomes angry and aggressively assaults her. When she attacks him with a letter opener in self defense, Secret Service agents Bill Burton (Scott Glenn) and Tim Collin (Dennis Haysbert) shoot her to death. Chief of Staff Gloria Russell (Judy Davis) arrives and makes the scene appear as if a burglar killed Sullivan's wife. Luther is discovered by not recognized & barely escapes with some valuables as well as the bloody letter opener.\n\nThe next day, Detective Seth Frank (Ed Harris) begins his investigation of the crime. Luther knows that he will be tracked & arranges for fake passports to flee the country. Luther quickly becomes a prime suspect in the burglary because of his reputation as a thief, but Frank does not believe it likely he murdered Christy. Just as Luther is about to flee the country, he sees President Richmond on television, publicly commiserating with Walter on his loss. Incensed by the fake sympathy, Luther decides to bring the President to justice. Meanwhile, Burton asks Frank to keep him informed about the case while a Secret Service agent wiretaps Frank's office telephone.\n\nLuther's estranged daughter Kate (Laura Linney), who works as a prosecutor, accompanies Detective Frank to Luther's home to search for clues. Photographs in the house indicate that Luther has secretly been watching her for years. She still suspects Luther of the crime, and therefore agrees to set him up. Frank guarantees Luther's safety, but through the wiretap Burton learns of the plan and Collin says that he will kill Luther at the cafe. Someone also tips off Walter, who hires a hit-man (Richard Jenkins) to kill Luther.\n\nThe two snipers, each unaware of the other, try to shoot Luther when he arrives at an outdoor cafe to meet his daughter. But they both miss, and Luther escapes through the police cordon because he came prepared, wearing the uniform of a police officer beneath his coat. Luther later explains to Kate exactly how Christy was killed, and by whom.\n\nLuther begins to taunt Chief of Staff Russell, first by sending her a photograph of the letter opener, then tricking her into wearing Christy's necklace in public. Correctly suspecting that Kate knows the truth, President Richmond elects to have her killed. Luther learns from Detective Frank that the Secret Service has taken over surveillance of Kate, so races back to Washington D.C. to protect her. He arrives at her jogging path just moments after Collin has used his SUV to push her and her car off a cliff. Collin tries to kill her again at the hospital, approaching her bed with a poison-filled syringe. Luther is waiting this time. He subdues Collin by jabbing him in the neck with a syringe of his own, forcing Collin to drop his. Collin pleads for mercy, but Luther says he's \"fresh out,\" delivering a fatal dose.\n\nLuther finds out that Sullivan gave no reason publicly why Christy stayed home. On the night of her murder, Christy said to Richmond that she told Walter she was sick. He incapacitates Walter's chauffeur and replaces him, telling Walter what happened on the night of the murder. Walter is unconvinced until Luther explains how Richmond lied in a speech by citing Christy's excuse for staying home, which he could only have learned from her. Luther shows Walter the letter opener that Christy used a stabbing weapon, with Richmond's blood and fingerprints on it.\n\nLuther stops the car and hands over the letter opener, dropping off Walter outside the White House. Walter tells Luther that he never stopped loving Christy. A trusted Walter is able to get through security with it and enter the Oval Office. Meanwhile, alerted by Luther that his phones have been bugged, Frank discovers that a remorseful Burton has committed suicide. Frank uses the evidence Burton left behind to arrest Russell. On the television news, there is the shocking news, \"confirmed\" by Walter, that the President has committed suicide by stabbing himself to death. Luther is happy to know that Walter got justice after all.\n\nBack at the hospital, sketching on a pad, Luther watches over Kate in her hospital bed. Detective Frank visits briefly, whereupon Luther suggests to Kate that she invite Frank to dinner sometime, and then continues to draw a new picture of the daughter he loves."

    "Accident Man: Hitman's Holiday": "Still dealing with his guilt after being forced to kill his assassin co-workers, assassin Mike Fallon (Scott Adkins) moves to the island of Malta to decompress and get away from London, finding work as a hit-man for hire in nearby countries and keeping martial artist Wong Siu-ling (Sarah Chang) (a descendant of Kung-Fu master Wong Fei-Hung who ultimately becomes Mike's sidekick) on his payroll to fight him at random times and keep his skills sharp.\n\nOne night, Mike runs into old friend Finicky Fred (Perry Benson) (Mike's colleague from the first film who specializes in unorthodox weapon), who informs him that their former boss Big Ray (Ray Stevenson) (Mike's maniacal father figure and mentor from the first film) lost his assassin's bar after Mike's vengeful rampage. Big Ray lost all his clients after word got out that he had lost all his assassins. Fred is out of money due to giving a large sum to a woman he fell in love with online. Mike says that Fred has been scammed, but Fred is sure that his girl Leylo is real and lives in Malta. Fred is in Malta to meet her. Mike takes pity on Fred and allows him to stay in his house and assist him on hits. Fred is really useful in the field with his devices and business is booming. Mike is happy for the first time in a long while. He and Fred put together a secret headquarters to test out Fred's gadgets and plan jobs. Fred has designed a set of explosive suits, that look just like a normal suit, that Mike thinks won't work. On Mike's advice, Fred rejects a contract put out on Dante Zuuzer (George Fouracres), the spoiled heir to a Cosa Nostra organization that even Mike fears. Siu-Ling promises to help Fred find Leylo.\n\nAfter carrying out another hit, Mike and Fred are abducted and taken to meet with Mrs. Zuuzer (Flaminia Cinque), who asks Mike to hunt down and kill whoever accepted the contract on Dante in exchange for sparing Fred's life; an attempted hit on Dante had been carried out using Mike's Modus Operandi. Dante snorts cocaine all day and has dreams of becoming a pop singer, even though his voice is terrible. She knows that the contract on Dante was put out by a corporate CEO out of Scandinavia.\n\nThe Zuuzers release Mike, who encounters Big Ray in his local pub - Fred had sent Ray a letter explaining their new business operation against Mike's advice. Ray vows revenge on Mike, revealing he's in Malta for a job, and Mike deduces he was behind the attempt on Dante's life. Ray explains that the client has raised the bounty to Euros 9 million and opened the contract to any takers, as well as hacked into the tracking device in Dante's watch to broadcast his location. Mike resolves to protect Dante in order to keep Fred alive.\n\nMike arrives at the karaoke bar where Dante sings, but Dante refuses to destroy his watch and swallows it. Assassin Freya Du Preeze (Zara Phythian) (a highly skilled assassin claimed to have been trained in the dark arts by those who viewed James Bond as a \"muppet\") arrives first and kills Dante's team of bodyguards before Mike fights her and kills her with a barbecue skewer. It is clear that Dante doesn't like Mike, who keeps pushing him around. Dante orders Mike to take him back to his mother, but Mike talks to Mrs. Zuuzers and agrees to keep Dante alive in exchange for Fred's life.\n\nHe then forces Dante to take a laxative in order to pass the watch, but the two are accosted by blood-drinking assassin Yendi the Vampire (Faisal Muhammed) (an assassin from Ghana who enjoys consuming blood), who Mike kills with his own machete. They travel to Mike's headquarters, hoping to keep Dante secure, where Mike meets Siu-ling. Siu-Ling says she knows that Mike is an assassin and wants to join him. Mike fights Poco the Killer Clown (Beau Fowler) (a highly durable killer clown who carries a giant hammer as his main weapon) and kills him with one of Fred's previously broken gadgets, while Siu-ling fights rival assassin Silas the Strangler (Peter Lee Thomas) (an assassin who prefers to strangle his victims to death) and strangles him to death with a heavy chain.\n\nDante manages to pass the watch before nearly being killed by swordsman Oyumi (Andreas Nguyen) (an assassin with Japanese origins whose fighting style is based on Ninjutsu); Mike challenges him to a hand-to-hand fight for Dante's life, but receives a beating before Big Ray arrives and kills Oyumi with a shotgun. Ray attempts to kill Dante, but Mike convinces him to stand down for Fred and destroy the tracking device. Mike says that Ray brought him up, and so Ray is responsible for the way he turned out. Mike says that Fred is the only real friend he has in life and tells Ray that even killers need friends. Ray relents and asks Dante to clean up and change into one of Fred's suits.\n\nMike, Ray, and Siu-ling transport Dante to Mrs. Zuuzer to exchange him for Fred; Mrs. Zuuzer orders Mike and Fred to leave the island, but Ray detonates an explosive that Fred had planted in Dante's suit, killing Dante and Mrs. Zuuzer and earning them the 9-million-euro bounty.\n\nFred meets the woman he fell in love with online, but Mike explains that she left him after learning he was an assassin. In an ending voiceover, Mike tells the audience that the bounty allowed him, Fred, and Ray to set up a new assassins' organization and move on to the next chapter of their lives, which he promises to be \"a f**king Belter\"."

    "Across 110th Street": "A trade of drug money is occurring between two Italians (from the South of 110th street in New York) and three blacks (from Harlem to the North of 110th Street). Suddenly, two men (Paul Benjamin & Ed Bernard) uniformed as police officers knock on the door. When they enter one of the two men dressed as cops holds the drug dealers hostage with a machine gun. When one of the black hostages reaches for his pistol, the man shoots everyone in the room to death, except his partner. When the two killers rush out with the drug money, they hop in a car with their driver (Antonio Vargas). When the driver nervously hits a few of the cars around them, it attracts the attention of an African-American cop, who is shot to death by the man with the machine gun before he realizes what's going on. Another cop (this one white) comes upon the situation and pulls his gun, but is fatally hit by the getaway car.\n\nSeemingly before the cops are aware of the situation, the two crime syndicates are aware that they've been ripped off. Mafioso Nick D'Salvio(Anthony Franciosa) is coached by his Don (who is also his father-in-law) that this is an opportunity to keep the blacks in check and that he must severely punish the men responsible for the robbery and the murder of the two Italians. D'Salvio pays a visit to the black crime boss in Harlem, Doc Johnson (Richard Ward). Johnson promises to put his main henchman, Shevvy (Gilbert Lewis), on the the trail of the thiefs. But D'Salvio threateningly intones that, while Shevvy may find them, the punishment must be left to the Italians. Johnson, unintimidated, taunts D'Salvio as a \"punk errand boy\", causing D'Salvio to try to attack him. However, D'Salvio's henchman hold him back and calm him before they leave.\n\nThe police have finally arrived and are all over the building where the drug theft and massacre occurred. Aging Cpt. Mattelli (Anthony Quinn) arrives prepared to oversee the investigation. However Mattelli's chief lets him know to his chagrin that the much younger (and African-American) Lt. Pope (Yaphet Kotto) will be leading the investigation. Pope mistrusts Mattelli because he rightly believes Mattelli to be a drunk, a racist, and a crooked cop who doesn't hestitate to beat up suspects or even crime witnesses.\n\nThe mostly black residents in the surrounding neighborhood of the crime (although we know many of them witnessed the crime) refuse to disclose information to the police. However, they gladly let Doc Johnson know the vehicle that was used in the getaway. Shevvy and D'Salvio use this track down it's new owner, Henry J. Jackson, who we recognize as the getaway driver of earlier. Meanwhile, tipped off to the vehicle's location, Mattelli and Pope have the car pulled out of the Hudson River. However, before they can figure out who was driving, Shevvy and D'Salvio have tracked down Jackson to a whorehouse. D'Salvio smashes Jackson in the face with a glass and then beats him to the floor until Jackson is a bloody pulp. Before they leave, Shevvy is given Jackson's clothes and finds a note from a dry cleaners. The police find Jackson tied up in crucifixion and that he's been castrated. Pope and Mattelli try to get Jackson to tell them the identity of his killer in an ambulance, but Jackson is only able to scream in agony before he dies.\n\nJoe Logart (Bernard), who we recognize as one of the thieves dressed as a cop at the beginning, nervously sees the TV report of Jackson's murder. He is an employee at the same dry cleaner that Jackson had a note from. He goes to see the other, more trigger happy thief, Jim Harris (Benjamin), to let him know that he's going to try and leave the area. Logart suggests that Harris should escape as well, but Harris refuses and wishes Logart well. We find that Harris lives with his girlfriend and has told her about the robbery. Harris is a 42-year-old ex-con and tells her that there's no way he could make money other than by crime.\n\nMattelli takes Pope to Doc Johnson's office. Mattelli warns Johnson \"no more crucifixions!\" However, Johnson is again unfazed and denies involvement in Jackson's murder. For Pope's benefit, Johnson announces that Mattelli has long since been paid off by Johnson for looking the other way in numerous crimes. Mattelli nearly attacks Johnson but sadly backs away. Johnson makes it clear that he no longer wants to deal with Mattelli and offers Pope to take his place. However, the honest Pope tells Johnson to take his money and \"stick it up your ass\". When Shevvy tries to manhandle Mattelli out of Johnson's office, Mattelli assaults him and beats him badly. However, Pope manages to pull Mattelli away.\n\nLogart, bags all packed, hails a cab. The cab driver acts suspicuously and calls into say that this be his \"last fare of the night\". Suddenly, two cars, containing D'Salvio, Shevvy and their henchmen, pull in front of the taxi. The cab driver runs off, but Logart manages to jump to the driver's seat and drive off. He runs down one of Shevvy's men and shoots another. Logart speeds off, but hits traffic with the two cars coming after him. Logart abandons the taxi and runs into an empty high rise being built. He manages to kill a couple more henchman, but Logart is soon surrounded and overpowered on one of the highest floors. D'Salvio and his men hang Logart by his ankles and swing him off the edge of the building. They threaten to let him fall to his death if he doesn't disclose the identity of his crime partner. He eventually does tell them about Harris, but D'Salvio still lets Logart die.\n\nMattelli and Pope go to visit Jackson's estranged wife. They let her know that Jackson has been killed, but Pope claims it was in a car accident. When they question her about Jackson's associates, she recalls Jim Harris's name. Going through police records, Mattelli and Pope narrow the various suspects down to the most likely \"Jim Harris\". Mattelli soon offers to confess to his various illegal activities so Pope can take his position, but the angry Pope refuses, saying he wants to become Captain on his own terms.\n\nHarris leaves his girlfriend's apartment to go to an abandoned hideout nearby. However, he seems to have forgotten his medicine and goes into a seisure. When his girlfriend rushes to his hideout to give him his medicine, she is followed (without her knowledge) by Shevvy, who concludes that she must be going to see Harris. Shevvy and Johnson tip off D'Salvio to Harris's location, after which Johnson claims to know how this situation is going to turn out.\n\nThe next morning, D'Salvio and a few henchmen go to the building where Harris and his girlfriend are hiding. D'Salvio knocks on his door and claims to be police. Harris immediately opens fire through the door, killing one of D'Salvio's henchmen. D'Salvio returns fire into the apartment, shooting and killing Harris's girlfriend. D'Salvio and Harris shoot it out through the hideout door. Harris eventually shoots D'Salvio and then knocks him over with the door, sending D'Salvio down the stairs to smash his face through a window . D'Salvio dies screaming. Harris goes out the street and mows down all of D'Salvio's henchmen with his machinegun. When a cop car pulls up, Harris also guns down both cops inside.\n\nSoon, the building is surrounded by cops, including Mattelli and Pope, and Harris takes refuge inside. The police trade fire with him until he is cornered on the roof. We see an unnoticed Shevvy crouched on the roof a nearby building, armed but seemingly enjoying the violent spectacle. Although Harris kills a few more cops, some snipers shoot him in the side and the arm. Harris throws his bag of hard-fought drug money over the side of the building into a crowd of onlookers, who fight over it. Mattelli climbs up to confront Harris, but lose his footing and is soon at Harris's gun point. However, before Harris can kill Mattelli, Pope arrives, shooting and finally killing Harris. Shevvy sets up his sniper gun on a mount and then shoots Mattelli. Mattelli falls into Pope's hands and dies."

    "Act of Valor": "In the Philippines, a terrorist kills the U.S. ambassador, his son, and dozens of children, using a vehicle-borne IED at an elementary school. The mastermind, a Chechen terrorist named Abu Shabal (Jason Cottle), escapes to a training camp in Indonesia. In Costa Rica, two CIA operatives, Walter Ross (Nestor Serrano) and Lisa Morales (Roselyn S\u00e1nchez) meet to consolidate intelligence about their target, a drug smuggler named Mikhail \"Christo\" Troykovich. Christo's men kill Ross and capture Morales, who is imprisoned in a jungle compound and tortured.\n\nAt Coronado, the members of Bandito Platoon, SEAL Team Seven are at home. Lieutenant Rorke (Lt. Cdr. Rorke Denver) confides to Chief Dave that his wife is pregnant and has the entire team spend time together with their families until their next deployment. SEAL Team Seven is then deployed to Costa Rica to ex-filtrate Morales.\n\nThe seven Navy SEALs insert into the jungle via HALO and hold position outside the compound all night. At dawn, Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen (SWCCs) are inserted down the river from the compound on-board Special Operations Craft - Riverine (SOC-R) and deploy a drone that identifies the guards and a large group of enemies camped down the road. The SEALs approach the compound, hear Morales being tortured, and decide to enter the compound early. Rorke and Weimy, the team sniper, provide cover for the other five, led by Dave, who conduct room-clearing, engaging several enemy guards. SEAL operative Mikey is shot in the eye, blinding him and knocking him unconscious. The SEALs extract Morales, escaping with her and recovering a cell phone full of the information she had gathered. However, the gunfight alerts the enemy quick reaction force down the road, who drive toward the camp. The SEALs commandeer an enemy truck and ex-filtrate. The hot pursuit forces them to revert to a tertiary extraction point where the SOC-R boats extract the team and neutralize the enemy pursuit with mini-guns.\n\nCristo and Shabal, who are revealed to have been childhood friends, meet in Kiev. Cristo knows the CIA is watching him and informs Shabal that subordinates will complete their project. Shabal is enraged, but he goes to the factory that Cristo specified where bomb vests are being assembled. These use plastic explosives and ceramic ball bearings to work like an enormous clay-more mine. They can evade metal detectors and are thin enough to be worn under any clothing without attracting attention.\n\nOn the amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard, Senior Chief Petty Officer Miller, the operations officer of the SEAL team, informs Rorke that Mikey will survive but has lost his sight in one eye. In addition, the intelligence they recovered confirms that Shabal and Cristo were working together. Shabal, an old-school Muslim terrorist, seeks to bring jihad to the U.S., while Cristo is not merely a drug dealer, but a smuggler, with routes and contacts for smuggling people into the U.S. Two of the SEALs, Ajay and Ray, are sent to Somalia, where an arms transfer involving Shabal is taking place. The remaining SEALs, comprising Rorke, Dave, Sonny and Weimy, stay in the U.S. in case the terrorists make it in. Miller himself has been reassigned to SEAL Team Four, hunting for Cristo somewhere on the oceans. Lieutenant Rorke gives a letter to Dave in case he is killed.\n\nThe two SEALs in Somalia confirm the presence of Shabal and sixteen terrorists and identify his plane. They track the plane to an island off Baja California, where the team stages an assault. They successfully attack and secure the island, killing eight terrorists. Rorke is nearly killed by an RPG that strikes his vest directly in the chest but does not detonate.\n\nMeanwhile, in the South Pacific, Cristo is hiding aboard his yacht, guarded by gunboats and mercenaries. SEAL Team Four identifies the yacht with satellite imaging and deploys several helicopters and gunboats. They quickly kill the guards and capture Cristo. Senior Chief Miller conducts his interrogation. Threatened with permanent separation from his family along with other implied sanctions, Cristo reveals his connection with Shabal and his plans to have his martyrs detonate their vests at strategic points throughout the U.S., causing a panic and doing economic damage surpassing that following the September 11 attacks. But Christo says he is powerless to stop the attack.\n\nThe SEALs are informed that not all of their targets were neutralized and that half, including Shabal, are en route to the U.S. via tunnels underneath a milk factory. They are ordered to link up with Mexican Special Forces and neutralize the remaining targets. U.S. Marines relieve the SEALs, who then travel on to Mexico meeting the Mexican Special Forces. The Mexican leader informs the SEALs that the assault will be extremely dangerous, as the smugglers are supported by the well-armed local drug cartel, and that a \"Black Hawk Down\"-style stalemate would have political consequences.\n\nThe SEALs and Mexican forces assault the factory, hiding in dump trucks. The combined forces cordon off the factory while Rorke, the Mexican officer, Chief Dave, Sonny, and several other SEALs led by Weimy clear most of the factory. The Mexican officer is wounded and the SEALs are nearly killed as the explosive vest of a suicide bomber detonates. As they reach the tunnels, an enemy fighter drops an F1 fragmentation grenade into the room. Only Lieutenant Rorke sees the grenade land. Realizing his team cannot escape the room in time, he dives on the grenade and it detonates, mortally wounding him.\n\nDave pursues the terrorists alone, while Sonny tends to Rorke. Dave catches up to the terrorists as they try to escape through the tunnels, but shoots seven of them as they flee into the entrance. Shabal appears, however, and fires nearly thirty rounds from an AK-47 into Dave, destroying his weapon in addition to wounding him critically. Dave draws his sidearm and kills the eighth suicide bomber as he runs into the tunnel. Shabal approaches Dave and prepares to execute him but is intercepted by Sonny.\n\nAt home, Rorke is given a military funeral with full honors. The SEALs pay their respects, punching the gold SEAL tridents that signify them as SEALs into Rorke's coffin. It is then revealed that Dave's narration throughout the movie was a written letter meant for Rorke's son, explaining the valor of the father he will never know, and ending with the poem \"Live Your Life\" by Tecumseh. The film ends with a dedication to every U.S. Navy SEAL killed in action since 9/11 along with a listing of their names."

Jessa MacGregor (Tiffany Brouwer) is Brandon's wife.\n\nMia is kidnapped when she refutes the advances of sex traffickers Vince (Sean Brosnan) during her hens party. In response, Vince kidnaps her outside the night club, while she was leaving a voice message for Roman from her mobile. Roman & Decklan find out about her abduction through her voice mail and reach a safe house using her phone's GPS location. Decklan calls the police. The brothers find some abducted girls, but no Mia.\n\nAt the police station, Decklan meets Avery (Bruce Willis), a cop investigating sex trafficking rings, who soon joins their cause to bring down the organization for good and fighting the corrupted bureaucracy that has harmful intentions. Decklan wants to take matters into his own hands and wants to find Mia as soon as possible. Avery tells Decklan that in the US, even the criminals have rights and that he is better off letting law enforcement to do things their own way. Decklan and his brother confer and decide to go to war against the abductors on their own.\n\nAvery has made slow progress on the sex trafficking case as the department will frequently reassign his resources to more high-profile cases. On his previous missions Avery has frequently found recently abducted girls in bordellos, where they have been repeatedly drugged and sexually assaulted to the extent that they end up dead in a few weeks. Avery works with partner Detective Brooke Baker (Sophia Bush). Avery was unable to save a girl named Samantha who was reported missing by her family and was found dead in a bordello. This gives him added motivation to save Mia.\n\nThrough investigation Avery figures out that the hideout Decklan found belonged to and Max Livington (Mike Epps). Avery takes permission from his boss to bring Max in and to shut down his operations. The brothers track out Haley (Jenna B. Kelly), who was with Mia the night she was kidnapped. Haley tells the brother about the organization who kidnap girls from bars, soup kitchens and shelters, how they operate and force girls into the sex business. Haley says that if anyone tried to escape, Max would catch up and set them on fire with lighter fluid. Decklan gets the organization's location from Haley. Meanwhile, Max arrives and is angry at Vince for picking up Mia from a local bar, as that is sure to get the police's attention. Max shoots one of Vince's men as a warning, but he likes Mia and keeps her alive. Max believes that Vince's reckless actions have led to police raids on his hideouts in the past weeks and months. Decklan gives a basic weapons training to Roman.\n\nDecklan & brothers attack Vince, based on Haley's information and capture him after killing a few goons. But the whole operation is captured on CCTV and Max is alerted to a new gang taking out his men. Vince takes them to Mia's location, but Mia has escaped (by scraping her way through the windows), only to be recaptured by Max during her run through a train yard. Brandon is shot in the attack & is taken home, only to realize Max attacked his house & killed Jessa. Avery takes the evidence produced by the brothers to his higher ups but is told that Max is shifting his sex trafficking base to LA from Cleveland. As a result, he has cooperated with FBI and DEA to give up every drug supplier in Cleveland. As such, Avery is ordered to let Max walk and remove all surveillance on him.\n\nAvery is frustrated and allows the brothers 24 hours to bring down Max. With Avery's help the brother's attack Max's location as he prepares to transfer all his girls to LA. They manage to injure Max and kill his goons and escape with the girls. Roman is re-united with Mia. That night Max attacks the brother's house with full force, which results in the death of Brandon. Decklan still manages to save the remaining folks with his counterattack.\n\nThe next day, Avery resigns the force citing its inability to bring Max to justice and proceeds to shoot Max before he can leave Cleveland."

    "Adagio": "Twenty-four hours in a Rome decimated by fires and blackouts.\n\nManuel, a 16 years old boy, one evening infiltrates a homosexual orgiastic party where alcohol and drugs are in circulation in considerable quantities. His task is to immortalize a minister present there as soon as he is guilty of exploitation of child prostitution. While filming his target, however, he realizes that the building has some hidden cameras and, shocked by the idea that shortly before he had been filmed while snorting cocaine, runs away.\n\nThe person who forced him to fulfill this task is Vasco, a corrupt policeman whose audiovisual material was commissioned by some high-ranking people in exchange for a large sum of money. Faced with the young man's escape, he flies into a rage and begins to hunt him down. Manuel takes refuge with Polniuman, an old friend of his father Daytona and, like the latter, a former member of the Magliana gang. The man, now blind, agrees to help the boy and sends him to another old acquaintance of Roman crime, Romeo known as Cammello, recently released from prison because he is terminally ill. The latter, however, chases Manuel away, preferring to enjoy his last days of life with his wife.\n\nThanks to the GPS signal from Manuel's cell phone that Polniuman kept with him, Vasco tracks down the gangster's home and instead of listening to his proposals for a deal, attacks him. The two end up shooting each other, and Polniuman gets the worst of it and is seriously injured. Reached by his trusty Bruno, Vasco finally smothers to death the criminal.\n\nThe next day Cammello, faced with Manuel's insistence, finds him a temporary bed on his terrace, then meets up with Daytona, now consumed by senile dementia: the two have not spoken to each other for years since the old man had sent his now former friend to carry out a heist which ended with the death of Cammello's son and the man's sentence to twelve years in prison and a criminal asylum. Daytona, until now unaware of everything because Manuel didn't want to worry him, in a rush of clarity confronts Vasco and Bruno, telling them to forget everything; these, in response, kidnap him and, not getting collaboration from a man mostly dedicated to reasoning without reason, kill him. Then, having consulted the files that linked the old man to Cammello, they go to the latter's apartment while he is not there and place a transceiver under the table.\n\nManuel tries to go to his house but, finding that it is monitored by some of Vasco's colleagues, he returns to Cammello who opts to accompany the young man to take a train to leave the city. During the journey the boy reveals that Vasco, shortly before, had photographed him while performing fellatio on an adult in exchange for money: that's how Vasco was able to blackmail him in order to do that task in the party, obtaining less material than requested but still finally delivering to his clients. Although Vasco has settled this matter, Manuel still remains a witness and therefore must be eliminated.\n\nCammello then returns home and only after explaining to his wife where he took Manuel he discover the transceiver, so arrives at the Tiburtina station, in total chaos as many trains have been stopped due to several fires. There he finds Vasco and Bruno who are looking for the boy. The two cops engage in a shootout with Cammello, who dies together with Bruno. Vasco, shot to death in the neck, tries to chase Manuel but dies shortly after.\n\nAt the police station, while on television they say that the politician he filmed at the orgy has resigned due to a scandal, Manuel meets one of Vasco's sons and gives him his headphones; the young man thanks.\n\nOutside, the blackouts and fires continue.\n\nIn the first part of the closing credits, Polniuman, Cammello and Daytona are remembered with two photos of their golden era interspersed with some short scenes that illustrate the sad end of their corpses: the first two are taken to the morgue, while Daytona is instead crushed by a junkyard together with the car in which he has been locked."

These efforts sometimes conflict with the law and cause Subhash trouble with his superior Inspector Muthukaruppan.\n\nCalled to investigate a girl's suspected suicide, Subhash deduces that she was murdered and gathers evidence. He confronts Abhijith, a boy whose mobile phone was active near the crime scene, and the boy's friends Christy, Bhuvan, and Deepak. The boys reveal that they committed murders of several other girls, avoiding the consequences due to their parents' privilege, being the sons of a prominent businessman, the District Collector of Chennai city, a gold merchant, and a well-known scientist.

Abhijith's father Sanjay has Subhash released from custody, intending to make a deal.\n\nSubhash kidnaps Abhijith and dangles him from a rope at a great height; he threatens to publicise the recovered video evidence of the boys' crimes, thereby ruining Sanjay and his reputation. Sanjay is given a chance to prevent this by shutting down a computer, but would have to let go of the rope. Sanjay does so, letting his son fall to his death to preserve his reputation. One year later, Subhash has become an IPS officer, and continues to murder unconvictable lawbreakers to serve justice."

    "Adipurush": "Thousands of years ago, the demon king Lankesh (Saif Ali Khan) gets a boon from the god of creation Brahma (Bijay J. Anand) that he could not be slain by Devas nor demons, thus making him invincible. He cannot be killed in the day or in the night, neither on ground nor in the sky, neither in the water nor in the air, neither by any Dev nor Demon. Lankesh sprouts 10 heads after this boon and laughs maniacally.\n\nElsewhere, King Dashratha (Krishna Kotian) of Kosala exiles his son Raghava (Prabhas) for 14 years to fulfill his promise to his wife Kaikeyi (Sonali Khare), Raghava's stepmother, that her son would take the throne. Raghava accepts this and lives in the wilderness with his wife Janaki (Kriti Sanon) and his brother Shesh (Sunny Singh) in the forests of Panchavati, near the river Godavari.\n\nSesh creates a line of truth outside Janaki's cave to protect themselves. He says so long they stay behind the line, they are safe.\n\nLankesh's sister, the demon Shurpanakha (Tejaswini Pandit), tries to seduce the brothers. Shurpanakha declares that she has accepted Raghava as her husband, but Raghava apologizes that he is already married. She attempts to take Janaki's life, but after a failed attempt, the demon ends up losing her ears and nose. Shurpanakha complains to Lankesh and describes Janaki as the most beautiful woman in the whole world. She says Janaki does not belong in the jungle, but in Lankesh's palace.\n\nUpon hearing of his sister's humiliation, Lankesh abducts Janaki in revenge. Janaki was enjoying the forest with Raghava when she sees a golden deer. She wishes the deer. Raghava goes after the golden deer but finds it calling for Sesh in Raghava's voice. Back in the cave, Janaki hears the voice and asks Sesh to rescue Raghava. Sesh is reluctant to leave Janaki alone in the cave, but Raghava's voice asking for Sesh, keeps coming. Sesh leaves after drawing a line of truth and asks Janaki to stay behind it. Raghava hits the deer with an arrow, who turns into a demon. At the same time Lankesh approaches Janaki's cave as a sage begging for alms. Lankesh forces Janaki to come out from behind the Line of Truth to give him the alms. He scares Janaki with misfortune that could befell Raghava due to a sage's curse. As soon as Janaki comes out, Lankesh abducts her and puts her on a giant bat and flies out.\n\nLankesh is attacked by Jatayu, an eagle, who tried to save Janaki. Lankesh attacks Jatayu with a sword and cuts off one of his wings. Janaki throws off her pearl necklace into the jungle below and the beads are picked up by monkeys. The monkey takes the pearl to his king. Lankesh brings Janaki to Lanka. Mandodari (Sonal Chauhan) is Lankesh's queen. Lankesh puts Janaki in the Ashok Vatika. Lankesh wants Janaki to be his queen, but Janaki says that she belongs only to Raghava. Janaki is adamant that Raghava to come to take her back. Vibhishana asks Lankesh to send Janaki back, but he refuses. Raghava and Sesh cremate Jatayu.\n\nOn the way Shabari (Asha Sharma) meets Raghava and requests him to eat her berries, which she tastes herself before offering to Raghava. Shabari is very happy to meet Raghava and says that there is nothing left for her to see. She immolates herself, and her soul guides Raghava towards the mountains where Sugriva, the King of Monkeys resides.\n\nRaghava meets Bajrang on the mountain and hugs him. Bajrang accepts Raghava as his master. Bajrang takes Raghava to Sugriva. Sugriva gives Raghava the Janaki pearl after Raghava narrates how she has been abducted. Sugriva will help Raghava but says that his Kingdom has been annexed by his brother Vali. Sugriva says that he can fight Vali's strength, but not his cunning. Raghava agrees to help Sugriva to get his Kingdom back. Sugriva challenges Vali for a wrestling match. As the match begins, it is clear that Sugriva is weak. But Sugriva is compassionate. He protects the monkeys from the collateral damage of his match, even as Vali mercilessly attacks him. Vali also picks up weapons, even though it is prohibited in a wrestling match. Raghava kills Vali, as he believes that a true King has to protect his people. Sugriva is the real King.\n\nJamavant proposes to send Bajrang and Angad ahead of the army to Lanka to tell Janaki not to lose courage, as moving the entire army will take a lot of time. Raghava gives his ring to Bajrang as his symbol. Raghava and Shesh set out to free Janaki with the help of the Monkey King Sugriva (Gaurrav Walia), his aide, Bajrang (Devdatta Nage), and their monkey army.\n\nJamavant reminds Bajrang that he is blessed by Indra, Vishnu, Shiva and many other Gods. Bajrang increases his body size and leaps across the ocean towards Lanka. Bajrang meets Janaki and tells her that Raghava is on his way. Bajrang is captured by Indrajit and brought in front of Lankesh. Vibhishana argues that Bajrang is a messenger and hence should not be harmed. Lankesh orders Bajrang's tail to be set on fire. Bajrang escapes and sets the entire Lanka on fire.\n\nWith the help of the Sea God, they are able to create a bridge across the sea (Ram Setu). When the sea wont part on Raghava's prayers, he is forced to aim a Brahmastra at the ocean. The Sea God appears and prays that it is his nature not to part. He promises that he won't let any stone sink that has Raghava's name on it.\n\nRaghava and his army successfully cross the ocean to reach the shores of Lanka. Meanwhile Lankesh's brother Vibhishana (Siddhant Karnick) is forced to leave Lanka because the later had opposed Lankesh's decision of abducting Janaki. Vibhishana joins Raghava's army. He only requests that Lanka not be punished for Lankesh's deeds.\n\nLankesh is given a final ultimatum via Angad to return Janaki by the next morning. Lankesh rejects and starts a war. He parades Janaki in chains in front of Raghava. Lankesh then proceeds to kill Janaki in front of Raghava to break his morale, but it was only one of his demons in the form of Janaki.\n\nDuring the war Shesh gets injured by Lankesh's son Indrajit (Vatsal Sheth). Indrajit possesses superhuman speed. He is able to penetrate Raghava's inner circle and launches an attack on him with snakes. But Sesh puts himself in the way and the snakes bite Sesh instead of Raghava. Vibhishana's wife tells Raghava that Sesh can be cured by the Sanjivani herb from the Dronagiri mountain. Jamavant sends Bajrang to get the Sanjivani, but Bajrang cannot identify the herb, so he brings the entire mountain. With the help of Sanjivani brought by Bajrang they are able to cure him. Vibhishana tells Raghava that Indrajit is weak in water, when he bathes in the Golden Lake. Raghava attacks Lanka from 3 directions on the day when Lankesh is busy with praying to Lord Shiva in his inner sanctum.\n\nRaghava and Sugriva successfully breach the city walls and the Lankans are forced to wake Kumbhakarna. Meanwhile Vibhishana smuggles Sesh inside the city towards the Golden Lake. Sesh drags Indrajit under the water, stabs Indrajit and drowns him, thereby killing him.\n\nRaghava successfully kills Kumbhakarna (Lavi Pajni) (Lankesh's brother). With no other option, Lankesh decides to go in the battlefield himself. A battle takes place where Raghava shoots many arrows at Lankesh's head but none is able to kill him. Raghava then shoots a Bhramhastra at Lankesh, at twilight from Bajrang's back and aimed at Lankesh's navel. Janaki is set free.\n\nRaghava, Shesh and Janaki completes their 14 year long exile and return back to Kosala, where Raghava is crowned as the king."

    "Adventures of Captain Marvel": "The film opens with an American archaeological expedition to the kingdom of Siam (modern Thailand) in Southeast Asia. While examining a number of tombs, the archaeologists locate a sealed crypt. Within the crypt, they discover an idol in the form of a scorpion, and eyes made from quartz lenses. When the lenses are properly aligned, a powerful energy beam emerges and instantly causes an explosion.\n\nThe archaeologists realize that they have found a powerful weapon of unknown origins. The lenses are divided among the members of the group, to ensure that none of them may operate the weapon on his own. Meanwhile, the wizard Shazam chooses one of the youngest members of the expedition, the radio journalist Billy Batson, to grant him the power to shape-shift into the heroic Captain Marvel. Shazam informs the hero that the idol is cursed, and that his mission is to protect those in danger from the curse's effects. When this task is completed, Shazam will depower him.\n\nFollowing the expedition's return to the United States, a mysterious super-villain starts operating. He is codenamed \"Scorpion\", and he steals the idol after which he is named. Scorpion then starts locating and killing various members of the expedition, in order to recover the various lenses. Captain Marvel repeatedly fails to stop the Scorpion, but soon notices that the Scorpion seems informed of everything discussed in meetings between the surviving members of the expedition. Marvel deduces that one of the expedition's members is a traitor, and is using the Scorpion identity to eliminate his former allies.\n\nThe surviving expedition members realize that there is one missing lens, which was somehow forgotten within the crypt. They decide to return to Siam to retrieve it. During this second expedition, Scorpion steals the missing lens and finds out the secret identity of Captain Marvel.. He kidnaps Billy Batson, but does not realize how the boy's shape-shifting powers work. Batson transforms to Marvel while in captivity, and then unmasks the Scorpion. The villain is soon after eliminated by a Siamese native who knows how to operate the idol properly.\n\nMarvel is convinced that the idol has a corrupting influence, and that more villains could follow in the Scorpion's footpath. So, he throws the idol and all of its lenses inside an active volcano, where they are destroyed by the molten lava. Captain Marvel has completed his mission, and Shazam quickly depowers him. Billy Batson is free to return to civilian life."

    "After Earth": "In the near future, an environmental cataclysm forces the human race to abandon Earth and settle on a new world, Nova Prime. The ranger corps was a military unit formed to aid in the evacuation of Earth to Nova Prime.\n\nOne thousand years later, The Ranger Corps, a peacekeeping organization commanded by General Cypher Raige (Will Smith), comes into conflict with the S'Krell, alien creatures who intended to conquer Nova Prime. Their secret weapons are the Ursas, large, blind predatory creatures that hunt by \"sensing\" fear. The Rangers struggle against the Ursas until Cypher learns how to completely suppress his fear, a technique called \"ghosting\". After teaching this technique to the other Rangers, he leads the Ranger Corps to victory. Meanwhile, Cypher's son Kitai (Jaden Smith) blames himself for the death of his sister Senshi (Zoe Kravitz) at the hands of an Ursa. Kitai trains to become a Ranger like Cypher, but his application is rejected due to his recklessness, and Cypher views him as a disappointment. Kitai's mother Faia (Sophie Okonedo) convinces Cypher to take Kitai on his last voyage before retirement.\n\nThe training expedition is to the planet of Iphsos & is carrying a captured Ursa on board for cadets to train in the technique of ghosting. During flight, however, their spaceship is caught by an asteroid shower forcing them to crash-land on the now-quarantined Earth. Both of Cypher's legs are broken, and the main beacon for firing a distress signal is damaged. In addition the captive Ursa has escaped the damaged tail section of the spaceship.\n\nCypher instructs Kitai to locate the tail section of the ship, which broke off on entry to the atmosphere. Inside is the backup beacon, which they can use to signal Nova Prime. Cypher gives Kitai his weapon, a wrist communicator, and six capsules of a fluid that enhances the oxygen intake so he can breathe in Earth's low-oxygen atmosphere. Cypher warns him to avoid the highly evolved fauna and flora, and be careful of violent thermal shifts (basically the whole planet freezes over every night & to survive Kitai needs to reach a thermal hot spot where he can be warm). Kitai leaves to find the tail section, with Cypher guiding him through the communicator.\n\nKitai is attacked by giant baboons and, during his escape, is bitten by a poisonous leech. Kitai administers an antidote, but two of his oxygen capsules are damaged, and his nervous system shuts down. When Kitai awakens, he narrowly escapes a thermal shift. Kitai lies to Cypher, not informing him of the damaged capsules. That night, Kitai listens to Cypher tell him a story of when he was attacked by an Ursa, how he realized that fear is merely an illusion created by the mind's thoughts of the future, and thus he first began to \"ghost\" himself from the Ursas, choosing to live rather than to let his enemies, both fear and the Ursas, decide his fate.\n\nThe following day, Kitai reaches a mountaintop, and Cypher learns about the broken capsules. Knowing that the only way to make it with two capsules would be to skydive, Cypher orders Kitai to abort the mission. Believing his father still sees him as a disappointment, Kitai blames Senshi's death on Cypher's absence on the day of the attack. He skydives from the mountaintop, but is captured by a giant condor, and his communicator is damaged. Kitai wakes in a nest of the condor, where he is surrounded by huge saber cats attempting to get hold of the condor's chicks. Kitai and the condor fight the saber cats, and Kitai escapes. He reaches a river and builds a raft to continue along the river. Tired, Kitai falls asleep on the raft. He dreams of his sister, Senshi, who reassures him that Cypher's bitterness is just his own anger for not saving her. Senshi urges Kitai to wake up and when he does, he is surprised by another thermal shift and nearly freezes to death. Kitai is rescued by the condor, who sacrifices itself for him.\n\nKitai reaches the tail section and retrieves the emergency beacon along with another communicator, weapon, and more oxygen capsules. The communicator only allows Cypher to see and hear Kitai, but not for Kitai to hear him. Kitai learns that an Ursa, the ship carried for training purposes, escaped and killed the remnants of the crew. The emergency beacon does not activate, and Cypher realizes that the atmosphere is blocking the signal. Kitai heads to a nearby volcano from which he can fire the beacon, and is injured when the Ursa attacks him. However, remembering Cypher's words, to focus on the moment rather than the outcome, Kitai is able to control his fear and \"ghost\" himself from the Ursa enough to kill it. He then fires the beacon. A rescue team arrives, and the two travel back to Nova Prime. Kitai decides not to become a ranger and work with his mother instead."

    "After Effect": "I have to say this movie isnt to bad and probably deserves better then the 4.0 rating that it was given the storyline is fairly decent but the downside is the movie is constantly filmed in the dark and the characters are difficult to see the storyline is basically college students looking to make fast money and agree to do an experiment which they believe is really easy because a friend mentioned all he had to do was test games and got paid for it for 5 days work $2000 thinking its easy they agree.\n\nThey are sent to a Military base where there is all empty rooms with just a bed no T.V and phones arent allowed there this should be a warning sign for them but they agree and are soon tested to there limits and forced to fend for there survival its a movie thats been done before overall I rate it 6/10 worth watching but its a one time watch only you wouldnt want to see this movie more times otherwise you would find more problems with the plot and storyline."

    "After the Sunset": "After the Sunset begins with master thieves Max Burdett (Pierce Brosnan) and his beautiful accomplice, Lola Cirillo (Salma Hayek), retiring to Paradise Island in the Bahamas after one last big score, having lifted the second of the three famous Napoleon diamonds. Their financial future is set, their career in crime a thing of the past. However, Stanley Lloyd (Woody Harrelson), the FBI agent who has spent seven years doggedly pursuing Burdett, only to be foiled time after time, refuses to believe their retreat into domesticity. After a few months, Lloyd shows up, accusing Burdett of hiding out in the same place where a cruise ship is displaying another large rare diamond, the third of a set of diamonds that he stole. He thinks the two are planning to lift the third Napoleon diamond, one of the three largest non-flawed diamonds in the world.\n\nWhen the two adversaries meet up in paradise, Burdett unwittingly turns the tables and befriends the frustrated detective, showing him the pleasures that Paradise Island has to offer. Lloyd, out of his element, adapts quickly to the easy-going Caribbean lifestyle. Despite his pleas of innocence and placing Lloyd in first-class accommodations to show how he doesn't need to steal anything, Burdett's curiosity gets the better of him and he starts casing the ship. However, not only does Lola suspect that he's ready for one more job, so does the local thug, Henri Moor\u00e9 (Don Cheadle), who threatens Burdett to steal the diamond for him.\n\nBurdett pretends to work with Moor\u00e9, even giving him a fake plan as to how he would steal the diamond (which he earlier related to Stan). Stan teams up with local police officer Sophie (Naomie Harris) to catch Burdett, and tails him to Junkanoo, a local parade, where Max loses him, warning that he shouldn't tail so closely. Stan and Sophie then have sex, and Lola kicks Max out after realizing his activities. Max is forced to bunk with Stan, and they share their thoughts about each other's lives. The next morning, the authorities and Sophie discover them, revealing that Stan's FBI license is suspended.\n\nAfter a night of drunkenness on Stan's part, the two come up with a plan to get Sophie and Lola back, involving a scuba diving trip. Moor\u00e9's man attempts to steal the Napoleon diamond, providing a diversion for Burdett to steal it himself. He cuts off Stan's air supply to confuse the others, then returns saving him. On land, Sophie gets the call about the diamond being stolen. Stan and she angrily leave, while Lola prepares to leave. However, she is stopped by Moor\u00e9, who threatens to kill her if Max doesn't tell him where the diamond is. Fortunately, Stan and Sophie arrive and shoot him. Lola is nevertheless unfazed, and leaves Max anyway. After spending the night alone in their home, he realizes he wants her back, and catches her just before she leaves, proposing with \"the only diamond I ever bought\".\n\nThe next day, Max meets with Stan, who tells him he was never drunk, and entails how he let Max do all the work while he later recovered the diamond. Max concedes that his nemesis has won this time, and is simply happy to live out his life with Lola. However, he has fun with Stan by remote controlling his car once more, promising Lola it is the last time."

    "Against the Dark": "Prologue: \"Once the infection hit, there was little time to react. People did what they could but, since no one was immune to the effects of the virus, authorities were ultimately helpless as the virus rapidly spread. All who became exposed and survived an initial attack began their own relentless quest for blood, attacking and feeding upon the innocent. There was no vaccine, no known reports of individuals made immune. Neighborhoods and entire cities were wiped out. The very fabric of civilization was breaking down before our eyes. Many surviving humans like us were left to fend for themselves, moving around during the day and hiding at night, barricading themselves inside secure buildings. Others formed vigilante groups or became hunters, swordsmen who were tracking down and killing the infected. We were lucky when we managed to find a refuge, a place where there was some food and shelter, a place where we could survive until we could be rescued. But with the location of our refuge no longer being safe and the chances for rescue becoming more and more remote, our options were running out. It was now us 'Against the Dark.'\"\n\nMorgan (Danny Midwinter) and Dorothy (Jenna Harrison) have been holed up for the past three weeks at the medical complex where Dorothy was once a student intern. Dylan (Daniel Percival), Ricky (Stephen Hagan), Amelia (Emma Catherwood), and Charlotte (Skye Bennett)have come into the hospital looking for penicillin to treat Charlotte's pneumonia. Four hours before dawn, the two groups run into each other and decide to band together. Besides, they have to get out of the hospital before the generator fails and the main security door becomes permanently locked, and Dorothy is the only one familiar enough with the layout to get them to the door. Meanwhile, outside the hospital, Tao (Steven Seagal and his group of vampire hunters are fixing to enter, kill any vampires they meet, and search for survivors. They had better move quickly, however, because Lieutenant Waters (Keith David) has been given orders to \"sterilize\" the area at the crack of dawn. Fighter jets loaded with bombs are standing by, just waiting for the command to take to the air.\n\nFortunately, Dorothy knows that all the corridors in the complex eventually lead to the security exit, so they start wandering down corridor after corridor, stepping over bloody body parts and fending off vampires who always seem to come at them one at a time. First to fall is Dylan when he goes into a bathroom to wash his hands and gets carried away by an uninfected surgeon (Claudiu Bleont) looking for humans to feed to his infected daughter. The hunters catch up to Morgan and help him kill a vampire. Together, they then rescue Dorothy from becoming some vampire's dinner, as well as Charlotte when she stops to nap. They also rescue Dylan just as little Sophie (Andreea Ungureanu) is about to get a chunk of him. Next to fall is Ricky who, while stoned, wanders through a storeroom and can't tell mannikins from vampires.\n\nWith 29 minutes left before the generator fails, the hunters and all the survivors finally all meet. The survivors continue to wander the corridors looking for the exit while the hunters clear out rooms and shoot up more vampires. They all meet up again to take an elevator down to the next level. Next to go is one of the hunters, who gets pulled out of the elevator by a vampire just as the door closes and the elevator starts to descend. Suddenly, the elevator gets stuck. Morgan crawls through a hatch and starts to climb down the ladder. The elevator starts up again and knocks him to the bottom of the shaft into a pool of water where he is attacked by a vampire interested in his jugular. When the vampire tries to climb through the elevator hatch, Tao shoots him. The elevator starts up again, and the doors open. Tao gives a gun to Dylan and tells him to take Dorothy, Amelia, and Charlotte to the exit and then to head south to the nearest safe camp. Then he and his hunters go back to kill more vampires. When one of his troops gets bitten in the neck by a vampire, Tao does the only thing he can do...run a sword through her gut.\n\nMeanwhile Dylan and the girls have turned into yet another corridor, but this time they can see light at the end of the tunnel. Dylan goes ahead to check it out and is immediately set upon by a vampire. Hearing Dylan's gun fire, the girls start to run. Along the way, they meet a young boy. Amelia declares him not infected but, when she reaches out her hand to him, he bites her and runs off. Now infected, Amelia hangs back while Dorothy and Charlotte keep running, fighting off more vampires as they get closer to the exit. They finally make it to the exit and get the door open. Tao and his last remaining troop, Tagart (Tanoai Reed) catch up, but so does Amelia, now fully turned vampire. She tries to convince them to become vampires, too, but Dylan sneaks up behind and shoots her in the back. Suddenly, dozens of vampires come running down the corridor. Dorothy, Charlotte, Tao, Tagart, and Dylan escape through the door just as a generator fails and the door closes, trapping all the vampires inside. The army starts dropping bombs, and the whole place goes up in flames. In the final scenes, Col Waters receives word that the hunters and survivors have made it out alive, Dylan, Dorothy, and Charlotte drive off looking for the safe spot, and Tao and Tagart walk off, no doubt looking for more vampires to kill."

Answering to his handler Agent Ronica Miles (Angie Harmon), Cody is called upon a mission to find information about a scientist named Dr. Albert Connors (Martin Donovan). Connors is employed by a SPECTRE type organization named ERIS led by Dr. Brinkman (Ian McShane), and his henchman, Fran\u00e7ois Molay (Arnold Vosloo). Cody is placed into the prep school of Dr. Connors' daughter, Natalie (Hilary Duff), the William Donovan Institute. As all CIA agents are known to Brinkman's organization, the CIA uses the unknown Banks.\n\nCody soon finds he has no social skill with girls and has no time to do this while balancing his chores and homework. The CIA decides to help by doing his chores and homework, trying to build his status, and going into the school to set him up with Natalie. The CIA also assemble a varying team of \"experts\" to train Cody into how to talk to girls, and issue him with a variety of gadgets with various functions.\n\nAfter Cody befriends Natalie, he is invited to her 16th birthday party, where he goes undercover to her father's lab. Cody finds that Dr. Brinkman is planning to use nanobots - which can destroy any carbon or silicon-based substance - to destroy the world's defense systems so he can threaten anyone who opposes him. Since the nanobots are inactive in the cold, he plans to use ice cubes to distribute them.\n\nCody falls in love with Natalie and nearly fails the mission at the same time exposing his cover to Brinkman and Molay, causing the CIA to suspend him. Dr. Brinkman sends Fran\u00e7ois and some men to catch Natalie and bring her into his base in the mountains.

    "Agent Game": "In the present day, 3 private agents are tracking a target in Antwerp, Belgium. They are supported by a local strike team Bundy and Manson, who covertly attack the target inside his home. But the target is prepared and launches a counterattack on the operatives. The target improvises normal house-hold appliances to convert them into weapons. This prompts the agents to come out and assist their strike team. When the team gets there, the target surrenders and the team have to fight off Belgian police to extract the target.\n\n5 weeks ago, CIA Agents Harris (Dermot Mulroney) and Bill (Jason Isaacs) are trying to get information out of Omar Abadi (Barkhad Abdi) at a black site. They are assisted by Visser (Annie Ilonzeh), and all three answer to Olsen (Mel Gibson), who is at the top of the command chain. Omar is held for receiving a large amount of money ($2 million) for his resistance group, the Crescent Democratic Front, which aims to oust the dictator, Bandar El-Mizdawi. But it seems that this amount of money came from a group that only associates with terrorists. The trio tries to get Omar to give in to the charges despite it being apparent that he has no prior information and is clean. Bill is sure that Olsen is holding something back on Omar. He asks Harris to take the call on this situation since Olsen is pushing them to kill Omar on very flimsy evidence. It is made clear that Bill and Visser have different motives and apply their own approaches to manipulating Omar. Visser brings in Omar's family to get him to confess, while Harris is the good cop. Bill believes that Omar is telling the truth. Harris, Bill's partner-cum-friend for years, observes on a screen from a nearby room. Harris tells Bill that El-Mizdawi is helping the CIA against Al-Qaeda, and a week after the deal was made, Harris and the team got orders to pick up Omar.\n\nOmar is ultimately killed by Visser under the excuse of defending herself from being shot. What follows is the revelation that Visser has her own orders from Olsen, and they include killing Bill too. And so, she shoots him as well in the interrogation room. This whole thing is observed by Harris, who makes a run with the footage of the whole incident and escapes before Visser and two guards (formerly thought to be working for Harris and Bill) can get hold of him.\n\nBack in the present, we see three private agents on their way to capture a person. This is also on order from Olsen. Later, we see Kavinsky (Adan Canto), Miller (Katie Cassidy), and Reese (Rhys Coiro) bringing the person in via air. Also, Kavinsky has been receiving encrypted messages since they were putting the person on the plane. Later, it is revealed that the person is none other than Harris. Kavinsky searches the entire plane before boarding it.\n\nKavinsky is an ex-marine, and had been rejected by the CIA 5 times, and he had been taking on private assignments in the meantime. Olsen had called Kavinsky for a meeting a few days ago and asked him to undertake a mission as a test for his readiness to join the CIA. Olsen also met Miller, who had dropped out of college twice, and had beaten up her professor at Harvard Law School. Olsen recruits her for his mission. Someone from CIA (Called Control and later revealed to be Visser) is in contact with Kavinsky via messages and tells him not to talk to the target, or to open the encrypted messages that he has been receiving on his phone. In parallel, Control is in touch with Miller and tells her not let Kavinsky open the messages or talk to the target under any circumstances.\n\nOmar's interrogation, followed by Harris's capture, are both parts of Olsen's plan, which in turn is following orders from Langley (CIA headquarters). Omar is a sacrifice as a part of a deal struck between the CIA and El-Mizdawi (the very dictator that Omar and his organization intend to overthrow). El-Mizdawi would allow the CIA access to his resources to bring down Al-Qaeda (whom Mizdawi hates as well). In return, the CIA would have to stop those trying to overthrow him, e.g., Omar. Olsen is given the responsibility to handle the operation and, with loose ends never an option, he does all in his power to have a \"clean-up,\" i.e., kill everyone associated with this operation without a trace.\n\nThe team panics when Kavinsky finds body bags inside the plane, the cockpit door locks, and the plane starts descending. It is obvious that the team is heading into a trap. Needing answers Kavinsky wants to talk to the target. Miller stops Kavinsky but agrees with his logic and they decide to look at the messages he has been receiving from his unknown source. The message has a video showing Visser killing someone on her own team. All 3 team members say that Olsen told them that Visser would be running point on this Operation. Miller figures that the encrypted messages are coming from their target. The team agrees to now hear from their target, who is revealed to be Harris.\n\nHarris reveals that the team (bringing in Harris) would be intercepted by Visser after landing in Thailand, killed, and deemed KIA. But this doesn't happen as the team decides to work with Harris to foil Visser's plot. This video would prove Visser and her seniors guilty of killing a CIA operative. The senior in this case, is Olsen. Olsen, however, doesn't know anything about this footage.\n\nWhat follows is a gunfight between Visser and her men and Harris and the trio (Kavinsky, Miller, and Reese). Olsen had sent in a strike team to kill everyone, including Visser, but the team manages to fight them off. Visser realizes that she has been burned, when Olsen will not pick up her phone. In the ensuing firefight, Visser is killed by Harris. Despite Olsen's best efforts to kill everyone at the location, including a drone strike (to eliminate the strike team sent in to kill Visser and the team), Harris makes it out alive along with Kavinsky and Miller. Reese isn't able to make it. But to Olsen, everyone is dead, and the secret is buried underground forever.\n\nTwo weeks later, Olsen receives a video feed that shows Visser killing Bill, proof that he can compromise him to the CIA big-time. Realizing that he is being tracked, he looks around and recognizes a white van. Despite being shot at, the van and its occupants (Harris, Kavinsky, and Miller) escape unhurt. Olsen contacts a man and telling him, \"We have a problem.\""

    "Agent Vinod": "In the Dasht-E-Margoh desert in remote Afghanistan, inside a Taliban camp, an ISI official, Col. Huzefa (Shahbaz Khan), is interrogating a captured man (Saif Ali Khan) suspected to be a Research and Analysis Wing agent. The man offers up details about RAW's operations in Afghanistan in exchange for money and safe passage across the border. He betrays his colleague, Major Rajan (Ravi Kissen), who has also infiltrated the camp. This is only a ruse, as both overpower their captors and fight their way out of the camp. Along the way, they rescue a girl called Farah (Maryam Zakaria). The man is actually a RAW agent and his Nom-De-Guerre is Agent Vinod.\n\nAn arms dealer dies in Russia & a suitcase nuclear device in his possession goes on sale. Every terrorist group in the world wants their hands on this device. In New Delhi, Agent Vinod enters RAW headquarters to meet his boss Hassan Nawaz (B. P. Singh). Nawaz shows him Major Rajan's final message from Russia. Rajan was in Russia as the bodyguard of Abu Nazer. Rajan overheard a meeting between Nazer & a Colonel of unknown identity. The general asked Nazer to transfer $50 MM to Morocco & to procure '242'. Just as he completes his message, Rajan is killed by a man who has a scorpion tattoo on his forearm. Nawaz asks Vinod to find out what '242' is. Vinod travels to Moscow, and enters a nightclub owned by Abu Nazer (Ram Kapoor). He manages to capture and interrogate Nazer, who tells him a man called Freddie Khambatta is to smuggle the $50 MM to Morocco. Vinod is almost captured by Nazer's men, but manages to escape, killing Nazer in the process.\n\nVinod boards a flight to Marakkesh, Morrocco. Freddie Khambatta turns out to be the flight steward. Vinod picks him up from the airport, only to assume his place. As Freddie, Vinod meets local mafia boss David Kazan (Prem Chopra), who is accompanied by his personal (Pakistani) doctor, Ruby Mendes (Kareena Kapoor). Kazan suspects Vinod, and gets Ruby to administer him a truth serum. Vinod blurts out that he is a RAW agent and killed Abu Nazer. Kazan confronts Vinod when he regains consciousness, but Vinod manages to convince him he is Freddie Khambatta, and explains he had to kill Abu Nazer to protect the mission. He manages to hack Kazan's phone and finds out that a MI6 agent is reaching Morocco the following day.\n\nIn the meantime, Vinod gets closer to Ruby, and tries to find out what '242' is. Ruby is actually Iram, a British-Pakistani who is working undercover for the ISI. Vinod goes to meet the MI6 agent and finds him murdered in his room with strong pointers that the murder was committed by Ruby. He gets an invitation card from the murdered agent's room for a private auction. He learns that many international terrorist groups are converging at an antiques auction in Marakkesh to purchase '242'. Vinod brings Ruby to the auction, where Kazan is also present along with Jagadishwar Metla (Dhritiman Chatterji). Vinod spots an LTTE agent he had encountered previously, and from him, learns that '242' is actually the detonator for the nuclear device, disguised as an antique volume of Omar Khayyam's 'Rubaiyyat'. A bidding war ensues, and Kazan manages to secure the detonator.\n\nKazan and Colonel (the mysterious guy from earlier in the movie) confront Vinod & decapitate him, and escape with the detonator. In Chaman, Baluchistan, the head of the ISI is murdered by Col. Huzefa, who is actually part of a group of rogue ISI colonels planning an attack on India. In Morocco, Kazan locks the detonator with a password, and hands it over to Colonel (Adil Hussain), who has arrived in Morocco. Iram runs into the real Freddie Khambatta, and finds out Vinod is a RAW agent. Iram says that she is a British agent. She was implicated in the London bomb blasts when her Muslim friends kept bombs in her car, without her knowledge. she was in jail, when Iftikar approached her, convinced of her innocence, asked her to shadow Kazan. Since Iftikar is dead, Vinod cant prove the truth of her statements. Managing to escape from men trying to kill them, both agree to work together to prevent the nuclear device from falling into the wrong hands. Iram/Ruby decides to enter Kazan's estate to retrieve the detonator.\n\nRuby returns to Kazan's estate only to find it ransacked and Kazan shot dead by 'Colonel'. 'Colonel' captures Ruby and asks her to reveal the whereabouts of Agent Vinod. He plants a sniper next to the hotel where Agent Vinod is to rendezvous with Ruby. The sniper takes a shot at him but Vinod manages to escape and is admitted to a hospital. The assassin reaches the hospital in the guise of a doctor and tries to administer a venom injection to Vinod. Vinod spots the scorpion tattoo on the doctor's forearm and overpowers him, killing him. He then clears his way out of the hospital to find Iram.\n\n'Colonel' who is now in possession of the detonator, has reached Latvia to acquire the bomb. He enlists Iram to seduce an airport security employee to get his ID card. Iram succeeds in doing so, and 'Colonel' provides the ID card to his man, who is to transport the bomb out of Latvia. Colonel also sets up a rigged bomb so that both the airport employee and Iram die in the blast. Security employee forces Iram to make love with him but escapes by throwing her skirt at him. Vinod arrives and as he interrogates Iram (Vinod thinks Iram set up the hit on Vinod at the hotel), the blast occurs, giving Iram the realization that she was being set up by the Colonel.\n\nVinod and Iram join hands and try to capture the Colonel and the bomb. Iram tells Vinod that the Colonel has called for a meeting at Karachi with fugitive don Pasha who can also be in the plot. The Colonel gets the Rubaiyat from Vinod, by forcing his RAW colleague to betray Vinod (by kidnapping the colleagues wife and kids) and tells his men to kill Vinod and Iram. However, Vinod manages to kill them all. Iram and Vinod reach Karachi, where they meet Farah, who is a dancer. With her help, they enter the wedding attended by an Indian mafia don (Gulshan Grover). There, they learn that Col. Huzefa and the don have agreed to smuggle the nuclear device from Karachi into India via the sea route. However, they are captured by Col. Huzefa, from whom they learn the target of the bomb is New Delhi. They manage to escape, and make it to New Delhi, where they try to find the location of the bomb. They find that the Colonel is staying with an ISI/Lashkar agent, who is an old professor. Iram finds the professor's map, which is of the bus route that one of Colonel's henchman, Jimmy is taking with the armed bomb.\n\nIram hurries to the exhibition where Colonel is hiding as a pilot of Indian media magnate Mr Metla. Iram runs into 'Colonel', and is shot, but points him out to Indian security forces, who kill him. Eventually, Vinod tracks down the bomb and takes the bomb up in a helicopter to detonate it as far away from the city as possible. Iram realizes that David Kazan had set the password to the detonator and asks Vinod to try the name of Kazan's camel. The bomb is defused but Iram dies of gunshot wounds.\n\nLater Vinod sees a recording, showing the Indian media magnate Metla planning the attack. Vinod accuses Metla and the Zeus group for murdering millions for making money at the global stock exchanges and starting a nuclear war in sub-continent for Geo-political reasons. Metla mocks Vinod, telling him world affairs are too complex for 'lowly police officers' to understand. However, Vinod is wearing a wire, and London cell of the Lashkar-e-Toiba are listening in. Realizing that they have been manipulated by Metla into almost starting a war with India, with the Pakistan government violently cracking down on them, the Lashkar sends a suicide bomber (Arif Zakaria) to assassinate Metla at a function in his honor. Metla is killed, but posthumously feted as a great philanthropist.\n\nOn a beach in Cape Town, the beautiful Russian girl who first acquired the nuclear device is seen sunbathing. She looks up to find Agent Vinod smiling at her. It is apparent Vinod has moved on to his next mission."

    "Air America": "Set in the year 1969, in the jungle of Laos, a local communist peasant takes a pot shot at a high flying US transport aircraft which is hit and begins trailing smoke, but makes it back to its base where it crashes and several crewmen on board are killed.\n\nThe scene shifts to Los Angeles where Billy Covington (Robert Downey Jr.) works as a helicopter traffic pilot for a local radio station. When he breaks several safety regulations by flying low, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration suspends his pilot's license. However, his piloting skills, bravery and disregard for the law are noticed by a mysterious government agent, who tells Billy that he can get his license back if he accepts a job in Laos, working for a \"strictly civilian\" company called Air America. It is readily apparent that Air America is a front for CIA operations in Laos.\n\nUnemployed and unable to find work, Billy takes the job. In Laos, he is introduced to Air America's unorthodox pilots and aircraft, being taken under the wing of Gene Ryack (Mel Gibson), a cynical and eccentric pilot and an arms dealer who uses official flights to buy black market weapons for his private cache. His dream, which he refers to as his \"retirement plan\", is to make a sale big enough so that he can afford to quit his job at Air America.\n\nThe next day, Senator Davenport (Lane Smith) arrives in Laos on a \"fact finding mission\", to investigate rumors about Air America transporting drugs on behalf of Laotian forces. Major Lemond (Ken Jenkins) and Rob Diehl (David Marshall Grant), CIA leaders of Air America, show the Senator around refugee camps, shrines, temples, and major cities in a careful deception to hide from him that Air America is indeed transporting drugs.\n\nWhile airdropping livestock into rural villages in their C-123 cargo aircraft, Billy and Jack Neely (Art LaFleur) are shot down. The Pilatus PC-6 of General Soong (Burt Kwouk) arrives at the crash site and his soldiers load bags of opium on board, but leave Billy and Jack behind with Communist Pathet Lao forces moving in. Gene and another pilot arrive and rescue them; Billy boards Gene's helicopter while the rest of the crew escape in another aircraft.\n\nBilly and Gene's helicopter is shot down by the enemy soldiers on the way back, and they are captured by a rural Lao tribe. Gene notices that the tribe is using obsolete and unreliable flintlock guns and strikes a deal to supply them with better weapons. Allowed to go free, Billy and Gene retreat to Gene's house, where Billy is surprised to discover that Gene has a wife and children. Already disillusioned with US actions in Laos, Gene convinces Billy to quit his job with Air America, but Billy wants to get even with General Soong for betraying him when he crashed.\n\nMeanwhile, Senator Davenport is losing patience with Lemond and Diehl, and demands to know who is smuggling heroin. Soon after their return to base, the pilots learn that during his search for Billy and Gene, Jack was killed and Lemond and Diehl claim that he was the ring leader behind the drug trafficking. Enraged, Billy purchases grenades on the black market and uses them to blow up the heroin factory, but guards see him running away. Davenport is still unsatisfied and demands more concrete evidence.\n\nThe next day, Gene finds a buyer for his arsenal, allowing him to leave gunrunning, quit Air America, and take his family out of the country. Meanwhile, Billy accepts one more flight before he actually quits. With co-pilot Babo (Tim Thomerson), he is assigned to transport flour to a refugee camp but they are instructed to divert to a nearby airstrip for \"routine inspection\". Billy immediately suspects a set-up, and a search reveals several kilos of heroin hidden in the flour sacks. With his fuel gauge tampered with, Babo and Billy decide to crash-land on the same airstrip where Billy crashed a few days earlier, and use the wreckage of the previous crash to hide the smaller aircraft.\n\nGene, on his way to make his final, largest weapons delivery, flies in to rescue Babo and Billy after wondering why Billy can't seem to keep anything in the air. Billy convinces him to respond to a distress call from a refugee camp caught in the crossfire between General Soong's men and local rebels. Gene tries to rescue the United States Agency for International Development official (Nancy Travis) in charge of the camp, however, she refuses to leave without the refugees. After some initial resistance, Gene dumps the weapons to make room for the refugees, blowing up the weapons cache to cover their escape.\n\nIn the air, Gene and Billy come up with a scheme to sell the aircraft to give Gene his money back. Senator Davenport recognises the set up for what it was, and the Senator threatens to reveal Lemond and Diehl's operation to Washington."

    "Air Force One": "The film begins with a joint special operations mission composed of Russian Spetsnaz and American Delta Force operatives to capture General Ivan Radek, the dictator of a \"terrorist regime\" in the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan.\n\nThree weeks later, James Marshall (Harrison Ford), the President of the United States, gives a speech at a state dinner in Moscow, telling the world that the United States will no longer negotiate with terrorists or fail to intervene in dictatorial regimes (a subplot that seems to reference the Bosnian and Kosovo Wars). Afterwards, Marshall, much of his Cabinet and his advisers board Air Force One to return to the U.S. Just before takeoff, they are joined by Marshall's family, First Lady Grace and First Daughter Alice.\n\nMeanwhile, six Radek loyalists and Soviet ultra-nationalists, led by Egor Korshunov and posing as a Russian news crew, have boarded the plane and shortly after take-off are able to hijack the plane and kill several people with help from Gibbs, a mole in the Secret Service. Agents hustle a reluctant Marshall to the escape pod before Korshunov's men can capture him. In the cockpit, the pilots attempt to make an emergency landing at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. However, the hijackers breach the cockpit, shoot the pilots, and set course for Kazakhstan. In the meantime the security service manage to get the President to the emergency escape pod & the pod is shown to successfully disengage from the aircraft, & parachute over German Territory\n\nKorshunov gathers the remaining passengers into the conference room and contacts the White House Situation Room, where he speaks to Vice President Kathryn Bennett. He demands that they arrange for Radek's release in exchange for the President's family. Until their demands to release Radek are met, the terrorists threaten to execute hostages every half hour. National Security Advisor Jack Doherty is the first to be executed, and Grace and Alice are taken up to the cockpit as separate hostages.\n\nMarshall's escape pod is discovered to be empty; he is actually still on board. It was also revealed that Marshall was a Vietnam Veteran, and a Medal of Honor recipient. After Marshall kills two of Korshunov's men, Korshunov responds by murdering Press Secretary Melanie Mitchell in front of Marshall's terrified family and over the intercom. Hiding from Korshunov in the avionics bay, Marshall is able to initiate a dump of Air Force One's fuel reserve. This forces Korshunov to demand a mid-air refueling, which requires the plane to come down to 12000 feet at which hostages can parachute out of the cargo bay of the aircraft Marshall sneaks back into the conference room where the passengers are being held and escorts them to the parachute bay.\n\nMost of the hostages escape via parachute, until they are discovered by one of Korshunov's men. The resulting chaos caused depressurization of the parachute bay, and several people are sucked out of the plane without parachutes, meeting their deaths. It also disrupts the refueling process, setting the refueling plane's fuel reserve on fire and causing it to explode in midair.\n\nKorshunov takes Marshall hostage, as well as Major Caldwell, Gibbs and Chief of Staff Lloyd Shepherd and threatens to kill Alice unless he agrees to call Russian President Petrov and demand Radek's release. As Radek prepares to leave prison, Marshall breaks free and kills the last two of Korshunov's men. Korshunov drags Grace down to the cargo bay, where he throws all the remaining parachutes overboard, except for the one he is wearing. In the ensuing fight, Marshall wraps a cord around Korshunov's neck, says \"Get off my plane!\", and opens the parachute, which breaks Korshunov's neck, and his dead body floats away off the plane. With all of the hijackers dead and regaining control of the plane, Marshall halts the release of Radek, who is fatally shot as he tries to escape.\n\nMarshall takes control of the plane's controls, turning it toward the nearest airbase. Back at the White House, Bennett discovers six Kazakh MiG-29s fighter planes piloted by Radek loyalists in pursuit and warns Marshall. A squadron of F-15s arrive and fight off the MiGs, with one pilot sacrificing himself to stop a missile from hitting the plane, but in the ensuing explosion, Air Force One is left so badly damaged, it is unable to land safely and is leaking fuel.\n\nAn Air Force Pararescue MC-130 Hercules plane is hastily tasked to zip-line Marshall and the remaining passengers from the plane before it hits the water. Marshall insists that his family be rescued first, as well as a wounded Shepherd. The last engine fails and when the final rescuer states he can only evacuate one more, Gibbs pulls a gun and kills both the rescuer and Caldwell, revealing his true identity. Marshall is able to subdue Gibbs before the steel cable detaches from the plane with the President secured. Air Force One finally crashes head-on into the Caspian Sea, breaking in half and kills Gibbs. The country celebrates as the President is winched to safety, and Marshall embraces his family and salutes the crew of the Hercules, who change their call sign to Air Force One."

    "Airlift": "The film opens in Kuwait, August 1990, with Indian businessman Ranjit Katiyal (Akshay Kumar) clinching a business deal with the Emir of Kuwait. Katiyal is a ruthless businessman who will go to any lengths to make a profit. He is successful and well connected in Kuwait and Iraq and calls himself a Kuwaiti and is generally derisive towards Indians. He has a well-appointed mansion in Kuwait and makes a happy home with his wife Amrita (Nimrat Kaur) and little daughter Simu (Abida Hussain).\n\nLate that evening he receives a word that Iraq has attacked Kuwait. He explains that Iraq and Kuwait have had tense relations: Iraq owes a large dollar debt to Kuwait and Saddam has urged the Kuwaiti establishment to reduce oil supply so prices can rise. When Kuwait refused and remained defiant Saddam ordered the attack. At this point, Katiyal believes the attack is one of the many minor border skirmishes. He asks Amrita to take the child away to London for a few days until things cool down.\n\nIn short order he discovers Iraqi soldiers are overrunning Kuwait and plundering the city and indiscriminately targeting and murdering Kuwaiti citizens. Katiyal and Nair, his Indian driver, drive to the Indian Embassy. They are stopped by angry teenage Iraqi soldiers and when Nair begins pleading in Arabic he is shot dead. Katiyal manages to reach the Embassy. The consul, a friend of Katiyal, explains that the Kuwaiti government has fled and Kuwaiti money is now worthless. The 170,000 Indians in Kuwait are now refugees until India decides its policy.\n\nKatiyal is pulled out at a check-post and taken to the Emir palace. Iraqi Major Khalaf (Inaamulhaq) is now in charge. He chides Katiyal for not remembering him from his previous visits to Iraq. He explains that Iraq has always enjoyed good relations with India and now he extends his own personal friendship to Katiyal by which he means Katiyal should transact business with him; business now includes supplies, transport out of Kuwait and anything else that may be needed. Katiyal hurries home; his mansion is looted but his wife and child are safe at his office. Katiyal meets with his friends and one of them owns a supermarket. After some initial confusion, he manages to convince them to stay together. A makeshift camp is set up at a nearby school and some 500 Indians move in. Amrita urges Katiyal to use his clout to extricate his own family but Katiyal, who ordinarily would have just looked to himself, appears to have a change of heart.\n\nKatiyal decides to stay and help others get out. He eventually discovers that the Indian Embassy has been evacuated as well. He phones the Indian External Affairs Ministry in New Delhi where he reaches Joint Secretary Kohli (Kumud Mishra) who, as is common in the Ministry, redirects him to another officer. As Katiyal is trying to reach someone the camp is looted by Iraqi soldiers. Katiyal reaches the Major who explains that his soldiers need food and may return again. The Major also reveals that Saddam has already permitted Indians to leave Kuwait. Katiyal goes to Baghdad to try and set up a way out of Kuwait.\n\nArriving in Baghdad Katiyal discovers that the Indian Embassy is of no help. The consul explains that they cannot issue passports since many others - Pakistanis and Bangladeshis - use war as a convenient excuse to claim Indian nationality. Kuwaitis in Iraq have also fled. The only remaining option, Iraqi Foreign Minister Aziz is somewhat helpful. He is a friend of Katiyal and is sympathetic to the cause. He discloses that an Indian merchant ship is due to arrive in Iraq and he will tacitly permit the 500 Indians to leave on the ship. But as soon as the buses are loaded and ready to leave Katiyal receives the news that there is a UN embargo and ships are barred from entering or leaving Iraq. One of Katiyal's cantankerous employees rails against him. Amrita comes to his defense and after a loud argument, everyone is resolutely supportive of Katiyal.\n\nKatiyal continues to keep in touch with the Indian Ministry officer Kohli but Kohli is somewhat of a sluggard. But when his own father recounts their tale of woe during the partition of India, Kohli awakens and begins to actively petition the Minister. The Minister, half in frustration and half in agreement, asks Kohli to handle it. Kohli approaches Air India (then national airline) and orchestrates an evacuation of the 170,000 Indians in Kuwait.\n\nKatiyal bluffs and threatens the Major to get him to let them leave. Kohli pleads and wrangles the Indian establishment to get the Amman Embassy to issue permits. When Katiyal finally loads up the Indians and leaves he encounters hostile Iraqi soldiers who stop him at a border checkpoint and threaten to sexually assault Amrita. Katiyal fights them off when he finds the Indian contingent right behind him. The Iraqi soldier drops his weapons and lets them pass. They all arrive in Jordan and the Amman Embassy receives word in the nick of time to let them leave for India. Kohli has successfully negotiated safe passage of all the Indians. Air India supplies the planes and the pilots, previously unwilling to fly over war zones, have had a change of heart towards their brethren. The Indian tricolor is hoisted over the Jordan airport and the film ends as the Indians salute Katiyal as they board the planes that will take them home."

    "Airport": "The story takes place during one long night during a sudden blizzard at Lincoln International, a fictional Chicago airport based very loosely on O'Hare International Airport.\n\nThe action mainly centers on Mel Bakersfeld (Burt Lancaster), the airport general manager. His devotion to his job is tearing apart his family and his marriage to his constantly angry and domineering wife Cindy (Dana Wynter), who resents his use of his job at the airport as a device to avoid going to various after-hours events she wants him to participate in, as she attempts to climb into the social circles of Chicago's elite. His problems in his marriage are further exacerbated by his romantically-charged friendship with a lovely divorcee, Trans America Airlines (TAA) passenger relations manager Tanya Livingston (Jean Seberg).\n\nThe movie centers on Bakersfeld's struggles to keep the airport open during the snowstorm. His chief problem is the unexpected closure of primary runway 29, caused when a landing airliner turns off past the wrong side of a taxiway marker light, missing the taxiway, and burying the plane's landing gears in the snow, blocking the runway. Bakersfield is forced to call upon Joe Patroni (George Kennedy), the tough and practical head of maintenance operations for Trans World Airlines, at Lincoln. Patroni is told to move the disabled aircraft blocking the runway 29. Patroni spends the rest of the movie with his men to dig the plane out of the snow and fights with the pilots to do so under the aircraft's own power without damaging it.\n\nMeanwhile, Bakersfield deals with his brother-in-law Vern Demerest (Dean Martin), a pompous and self-confident senior pilot for Trans Global Airlines (TGA) who opposes Bakersfield on a number of issues involving business and personal issues. Both Mel Bakersfield and his sister Sarah (Barbara Hale are unaware that Vern is having an extramarital affair with Gwen Meighen (Jacqueline Bisset), a chief stewardess on his routine flights who is planning her latest trip to Rome, Italy and is frustrated about her secret affair with Vern, who keeps telling her that he will leave his wife.\n\nBack at Lincoln Airport, the closing of runway 29 due to the stuck plane requires the use of the shorter runway 22, which has the unfortunate consequence of causing planes to take off over a noise-sensitive suburb, whose residents picket the airport in protest. Mel Bakersfield insists that the airport stay open despite pressure from the owner and the mayor to close it for the night.\n\nA little later, the airport authorities arrest an elderly lady named Mrs. Ada Quonsett (Helen Hayes) who is attempting to board a plane without a ticket. Ada is brought to the TGA lounge office where he and Tanya discover her to be a frequent stowaway who has a long record of stowing away aboard cross-country flights and passing herself off as the \"poor little-old lady\" to get away with it. Mrs. Quonsett is put in the custody of a TGA agent to be put on a flight back to her home in California, but she gives him the slip.\n\nBack at the airport, Patroni and his men have dug out the snow from the stuck airplane's landing gear and are attempting to move it. Despite Patroni's orders to use full power, the pilot refuses to do so, for fear it would damage it, and the plane only moves a few feet before getting stuck in the snow again, after which Patroni and the pilot get into a very heated argument. Patroni then tells Bakersfield they have to dig deeper and put lumber under the wheels for added support, and after another heated argument between Bakersfield and the pilot, Bakersfield agrees to let Patroni taxi the airplane out next time, as Patroni is licensed to taxi.\n\nMeanwhile, D.O. Guerrero (Van Heflin) is an increasingly psychologically-disturbed, bankrupt building contractor and demolitions expert, who is determined to find a way to solve his financial problems, regardless of what it will cost others. He builds a bomb that fits inside his briefcase with the intention of using it to commit suicide by blowing up a Rome-bound Boeing 707 Intercontinental jet over the Atlantic Ocean so his wife Inez (Maureen Stapleton), who manages a seedy diner, can collect on the $225,000 insurance policy (which he plans to buy at the airport prior to his departure) since a plane crashing in the ocean leaves no trace of evidence for the insurance company to investigate his death. He leaves their apartment, stops at the diner to say goodbye to his wife, and then leaves on the ruse that he intends to take a bus to Milwaukee to start a new job, but the bus is actually bound for the airport. When Inez arrives home, she finds a special delivery letter from the travel agency that issued his plane ticket; they accidentally overcharged Guerrero for the ticket, so there was a partial refund check enclosed with the letter. Confused, she heads to the airport.\n\nGwen and Vern arrive at Lincoln to board their Flight 2 to Rome and she tells him that she just learned that she's pregnant. As the plane begins to board, Ada stows away on plane and sits next to Guerrero who is behaving nervously, holding his briefcase (with the bomb in it) on his lap, intending to detonate it once the plane is over the ocean.\n\nAfter the plane takes off, Guerroero's wife arrives too late at the airport and goes into a state of shock. When she is brought to the security office after she is found wondering around, she manages to tell them about her husband and what he intends to do. Bakersfield learns about this and has Flight 2 contacted to inform Vernon as well as Captain Harris (Barry Nelson) about the bomb on board. Also learning that Ada is on board the flight and sitting next to Guerrero, Bakersfield contacts Vernon on board the flight to turn the plane around back for Chicago.\n\nAs the plane is being turned around, Gwen approaches Ada, loudly exposing her as a stowaway while ignoring Guerrero, in a ruse to bring her to the cockpit, where Ada is let in on what is going on. Ada agrees to help create a diversion. When she is brought back to her seat by Gwen, Vern appears and attempts to lunge at Guerrero who figures out what is going on and stands up out of his seat. Gwen manages to grab the briefcase, but another grumpy passenger, thinking they are wrongly grabbing \"personal property\", grabs it from Gwen and gives it back to Guerrero. Vern tries to persuade Guerrero not to trigger the bomb since everyone on the ground has figured out his plot and canceled his insurance. For a moment Guerrero looked like he was going to surrender, but another passenger comes out of the lavatory, and that same grumpy passenger yells, \"Grab him, he's got a bomb!!\", startling Guerrero, who runs into the lavatory and detonates the bomb. The detonation blows a large hole in the plane, killing Guerrero and seriously injuring Gwen. The plane is structurally damaged in the explosion and subsequent rapid decompression, forcing the pilot to put the plane into a dive, in order to get below 10,000 feet as quickly as possible, in order to get to breathable air before the passenger oxygen runs out.\n\nAs Flight 2 returns to Lincoln, Vern realizes the longer runway 29 is still closed and runway 22 is too short to handle the landing of the damaged plane. After a heated argument with Air Traffic Control, which Bakersfield also hears, he realizes the seriousness of the situation that Flight 2 desperately needs to land at runway 29, which still has the stuck-in-the-snow plane on the runway. Patroni and his men are still trying to dig the plane out of the snow and after Bakersfield tells him about the emergency, he goes into the cockpit and attempts to rev up the engines to free the plane, which after few tense moments, Patroni finally manages to do so without damaging the runway or the plane.\n\nAfter a harrowing flight back, Vern along with the other Captain, manages to land the plane on newly reopened runway 29, using the entire length of the runway, and save the rest of the passengers and crew. After everyone had disembarked, he decides to accompany the badly injured Gwen to the hospital where his wife sees him and becomes aware of his affair. He has decided to leave his wife to be with Gwen.\n\nAfter Mrs. Ada Quonsett is cleared of all criminal charges of stowing away, she is given a first class ticket to return to her hometown.\n\nHis marriage over, Mel Bakersfield asks Tanya if she would like to \"have breakfast\" at her apartment with him, and she happily agrees."

    "Airport '77": "Millionaire philanthropist Philip Stevens (James Stewart) arrives at his palatial estate and holds a media conference to discuss a flight containing his hand-picked guest list of rich and famous friends, which will soon be arriving in Florida. His luxury aircraft, a Boeing 747 outfitted with high-end accommodations, is packed with his collection of priceless artwork to be installed at his home, which has been converted into a new museum where Stevens hopes to share the treasures with the world.\n\nThe plane, piloted by Captain Don Gallagher (Jack Lemmon) lands in Washington. Gallagher meets the plane's lead production manager Stan Buchek (Darren McGavin) upon landing, and tells him the aircraft handled perfectly, and as they observe the museum pieces being loaded into the cargo holds, wonder whether the collection or the plane is more expensive. Meanwhile a mysterious pair of men-an airline employee and a civilian--stand at the airport gift shop and quietly switch suitcases as they meet at a magazine rack, never making eye contact or speaking. The employee then enters a locker room and assumes a disguise with a mustache and wig, finding a gun in the bathroom paper towel dispenser, and joins the ground crew as the cargo is loaded. Meeting up with a companion on board later, canisters of CR-7 gas are connected to the air supply, rigged to be activated manually.\n\nGallagher finds Eve Clayton (Brenda Vaccaro) in an office. They have been a couple for some time, and he finds the courage to bring up marriage, but she says Stevens has asked her to work in Geneva for him, which would put distance into their relationship. He wants a wife and family, and she wants her career.\n\nThat evening the guests begin to arrive and board the aircraft, including Benjy (Anthony Battaglia), whose mother is Stevens' daughter Lisa (Pamela Bellwood). She is taking her son to meet his grandfather for the first time, but her own relationship with her father is strained. Emily Livingston (Olivia de Havilland) boards with her personal assistant Dorothy (Maidie Norman). She joins several art critics she knows and, after the men and she exchange banter, she sits with them as their fourth and engages in a challenging game of poker. Jane Stern (Arlene Golonka) arrives with her daughter Bonnie Stern (Elizabeth Cheshire), who was chosen for the flight to present an artwork her schoolmates designed for Stevens' museum.\n\nA film is played of Stevens greeting the passengers and urging them to enjoy their flight. Bob Chambers (Robert Foxworth), the main conspirator, will be the co-pilot for the flight that evening, and he and Gallagher settle in the cockpit, while conspirators Wilson (Michael Pataki) and Banker (Monte Markham) are among the crew members. Gallagher appears on the screen to invite the passengers to view their taxi down the runway as the plane, now known as 2-3-Sierra, begins its flight.\n\nAt the bar, blind pianist Steve (Tom Sullivan) plays and sings a song for corporate assistant Julie (Kathleen Quinlan). The children challenge Dorothy to a tabletop video game while a woman leaves to find two men in the nearby office. Frank Powers (Gil Gerard) discusses a future underwater farming excursion with diver Martin Wallace (Christopher Lee), whose demeanor grows sour when the woman, his wife Karen Wallace (Lee Grant), enters the room in an inebriated state and shows off the bottles of booze she has collected. When Martin leaves, Karen teases Frank with threats to tell her husband about their affair, one which he much regrets. Eve talks to Philip from the cockpit and informs him that Lisa and Benjy are aboard, and he decides to head out to meet them. Eve then tells Gallagher she has thought things over and wonders if they can discuss their relationship in Palm Beach later. He agrees.\n\nA drink arrives for Emily, along with a calling card bearing the name of her old flame Nicholas St. Downs III (Joseph Cotton), she sees him across the lounge area and is happy to reunite with him after decades apart. Eddie (Robert Hooks) tends bar and tells Eve his wife is expecting twins, and she encourages him to call home to check on her, then speaks with Lisa in private. Determined to become independent, Lisa wants to break the news to her father that she won't be dominated by his power and position any longer, but Eve informs her that Philip is terminally ill and has months to live, and urges her to restrain herself. Julie and Martin are at the bar and discuss the sea, which enthralls him as a diver, but she admits water frightens her. Karen interrupts their talk and tosses a drunken barb at Julie, who leaves, and she and a miserable Martin exchange insulting banter.\n\nThe conspirators begin their coup. The security guard is knocked out, but is hit too hard and dies instantly, so they move the body out of sight. Gallagher is lured from the cockpit to tend to a sick passenger and is subdued by a blow to the head. They secure oxygen masks to their faces, the sleeping gas is released into the cabin, and the passengers lose consciousness. Chambers takes the controls and the plane descends below radar, heading into a fog bank, reducing visibility to less than a mile. He changes the flight path over the Bermuda Triangle, taking the craft off course at 600 mph. The air traffic controller radios the plane from Palm Beach when they lose the radar signal, but he ignores it. The plan is to remove the artwork and head to South America with their black market profits, while the passengers awaken to an empty plane on deserted St. George Island.\n\nMinutes later, as Chambers looks at the vista ahead, a large offshore drilling platform emerges from the haze, and they are heading straight for it. He pulls back on the yoke and tries to turn, but the wing clips the derrick and the engine catches fire. Chambers immediately hits the fire extinguishing button and the flames go out momentarily, but the sudden loss of airspeed threatens to stall the airplane. As the engine reignites, the stall alarm goes off and the tail of the plane hits the water. The passengers awaken and start to scream and panic. Chambers struggles to keep the plane airborne, but finally it hits the water violently and stalls in the ocean. Banker is in the hold securing the art for the transfer when a cargo container slams into and breaches the bulkhead, the ocean bursts in and sends the container back to pin him to a wall, and the surging water drowns him. Wilson is killed when he enters the cockpit and is slammed into the flight panel, and Chambers is knocked unconscious at the controls. As passengers recover from the initial shock of impact, Karen looks out a window and alerts everybody as the plane begins to slip beneath the waves, settling on the ocean floor some 100 feet below the surface.\n\nThe ocean bottom is fortunately above the depth that would crush the fuselage, and Gallagher calms the passengers, informing them that they have been tracked and will be rescued soon. Buchek suffers an impact fracture of his arm while trying to protect Bonnie, who has been injured under the bar. Emily looks after Dorothy, who took a blow to her head. Gallagher and Buchek ask a passenger, Dr. Williams (M. Emmett Walsh) to help. The doctor spends time tending to the wounded, though he later confesses to the lead flight attendant that he is actually a veterinarian for Stevens and is used to tending horses. Gallagher and Buchek examine the plane and find some cargo areas flooded, but others remain airtight for the time being. How long the plane will hold up, and the lack of oxygen, are concerns.\n\nTheir attention is drawn by Eddie, who has suffered a severely broken leg, and Nicholas helps them take him into the main cabin to rest. Martin also offers to help, stopping momentarily to calm Karen but stressing to her that she will be fine while he is away. Gallagher and Buchek interrogate Chambers in the office when he regains consciousness and hear the confession of the conspirators' plans. They put him on watch in the passenger area.\n\nSteve the pianist is seriously hurt, Julie stays with him and, when he touches her face as a way of imagining how she looks, she gives him her earring as a token, and he says he loves her. When he requests a drink of water, in the moments it takes to bring it to him, she finds he has succumbed to his injuries. Meanwhile, Lisa assures Benjy that Bonnie will be okay.\n\nShips and planes are sent out to search for the downed flight under the guidance of Joe Patroni (George Kennedy), and he assures Stevens that the plane will be found. With the crash happening far from their expected flight path, Gallagher tells Eve they are on their own. Buchek examines growing damage to the fuselage and finds more airtight areas being breached by water, and the passenger compartment begins to flood.\n\nAs Emily comforts Julie, she hears a droning sound outside and asks all the passengers to be quiet. Martin recognizes the sound as that of an approaching ship, which brings them hope, but the ship's crew do not know the plane is submerged near them and pass the crash site. Karen lashes out at Gallagher, blaming him for their situation. Gallagher and Buchek find the only inward opening door of use on the plane, located in a rear cargo hold which has remained dry, and they wire an electrical circuit inside. Gallagher announces to the passengers that he plans to exit the plane from that airtight compartment and send a life raft to the surface with a homing beacon to alert search parties to their location. Martin volunteers as an experienced scuba diver to join him and double their chances of success, and Gallagher agrees.\n\nBuchek shows Gallagher how to touch two wires together to create the spark needed to unlock the cargo door. Karen tries to stop Martin from taking the risk, saying they should think about themselves, but he argues that selfishness sent them into their predicament, and he kisses her before he joins Gallagher. Buchek wishes Gallagher luck, leaves the hold and the hatch is shut and locked. Placing their oxygen masks to their faces, Gallagher notes they can get two minutes of air to breathe as he joins the two wires once. The door creaks but does not open, so he tries again several times, finally removing his oxygen mask to investigate the connection. Martin steps over to the door, and before Gallagher can warn him, it bursts open, striking Martin and throwing him across the cargo hold in a wave of ocean water as the cabin floods. Gallagher swims to a glassy-eyed Martin and tries to revive him with oxygen, but he died on impact and the effort is futile, so he grabs the raft and exits the hold into the open ocean.\n\nKaren and the others watch in horror as Martin's body floats away. Several passengers try to settle a shocked Karen as Gallagher swims skyward, pulls the inflation device and sends the raft to the surface ahead of him. Swimming to it when he surfaces, he boards and activates the beacon, then sits helplessly hoping for a quick response. A Navy plane investigates the beeper which has suddenly appeared on radar, indicating the flight is 100 miles off course.\n\nOn the airplane, Karen is obviously in an alcohol-fueled state of shock from losing her husband. She absently preens in a mirror, then approaches the main hatch and attempts to open it, which would flood the plane. Eve approaches and tries to calm her down, but they begin to struggle. Karen pounds at Eve, who finally has to punch Karen and knock her out to prevent a catastrophe.\n\nA jet pilot reports to base that he has spotted the plane, which is completely underwater at the coordinates given. Gallagher shouts with joy as the passing jet dips a wing in acknowledgment. The Navy discusses the situation, and it is decided to raise the plane as they would a submarine in a salvage operation. Patroni guides the Navy in how best to raise the aircraft without splitting it in two, while Stevens is sent to meet with the survivors.\n\nThe USS Cayuga arrives at the site, and a crew comes by boat to retrieve Gallagher, who talks with Patroni as the rescue is coordinated, stressing that the passengers are running out of time. With additional salvage crew members and equipment, the vessel sends divers (Gallagher also volunteers to help with his amateur diving experience and knowledge of the aircraft) below to the plane. A diver writes to the passengers on a tablet and shows it to them at a window, indicating that they should secure themselves as the crew attempts to lift the plane from the water. Divers run heavy straps under predetermined points under the fuselage and attach them to huge bladders to fill with compressed air to raise the plane.\n\nThe crew aboard the inflation boat begin sending air down to the bladders, which inflate and rise, lifting the plane from the ocean floor, but another airplane door opens under the change in pressure, water begins to fill the plane, and one bladder breaks away. The flood sends some passengers spinning in its wake. Karen is swept away toward the back of the plane and drowns. Buchek grabs Benjy and prevents him being swept away as well. Chambers is killed when debris from the flooding strikes him.\n\nAs the boats and crew circle and watch at the surface, the plane breaks through the water, and rafts-one with Gallagher aboard--pull up to the hatch as flight attendants ferry Eddie, Bonnie and Jane and the other wounded passengers aboard. Emily and Nicky see that Dorothy did not survive the ascent and reluctantly leave her. The able-bodied survivors rush out to waiting boats, but when a second strap holding a bladder keeping the aircraft buoyant gives way, Eve is trapped with the water rising at her only exit. Gallagher wades into the plane to her side and they climb the stairs to the cockpit to exit by the door there, and jump into the ocean. They are lifted by helicopter to safety. The remaining bladders holding their former prison give way and Flight 2-3 Sierra disappears again underwater.\n\nOn-board the Navy ship, Philips greets Lisa and Benjy, the injured are airlifted away, and Gallagher and Eve reaffirm that they have a date in Palm Beach that night as they land and greet the other grateful survivors on the Cayuga's deck."

    "Airport 1975": "Columbia Airlines' Flight 409 is a red-eye Boeing 747-100 en route from Washington Dulles International Airport to Los Angeles International Airport. One of the passengers on board is a teenage girl named Janice Abbott (Linda Blair) who is sceduled to have a kidney transplant in L.A. and she is being wheeled onto the plane on a stretcher. Another passenger is the actress Gloria Swanson (herself) going to L.A. for another movie deal. Barney (Sid Ceasar) and Bill (Norman Fell) are two gambling friends whom are planning just another good time in California. Also on board are two nuns named Sister Beatrice (Martha Scott) and Sister Ruth (Helen Reddy) whom take pitty on the ailing Janice and Sister Ruth borrows a guitar and sings a song for Janice and the rest of the passengers.\n\nMeanwhile, Scott Freeman (Dana Andrews) is a businessman living in Santa Fe, New Mexico with an urgent sales meeting in Boise, Idaho. Failure to make this meeting threatens half his sales commissions for the coming year. He is en route in his private Beechcraft Baron.\n\nHowever, an occluded storm front has the entire West Coast socked in, with Los Angeles reporting zero visibility. That not only affects the Columbia flight but also precludes Freeman making his meeting in Boise. Both flights are diverted to Salt Lake City International Airport.\n\nFreeman's small plane and the giant Boeing 747 enter Salt Lake's entry pattern. Air traffic control assigns the jumbo to enter the pattern first at a low altitude of 10,000 feet, followed by the Beechcraft. As Columbia 409 is making its final approach, the co-pilot and First Officer Urias (Roy Thinnes) feels a vibration on one of the adjacent panels and rises to check it out. Freeman, anxious about his missed meeting, makes a call to the Salt Lake Tower asking about the delay. The tower confirms that he is second to land after the big jet. Freeman suddenly suffers a massive heart attack. As he grabs his chest, the Baron falls out of the pattern and descends into the approach of Columbia 409.\n\nThe Beechcraft impacts the flight deck just above the co-pilot seat. Freeman is instantly killed by the impact as his small plane explodes. First Officer Urias, still standing, is instantly blown from the cockpit. Navigator and Flight Engineer Julio (Erik Estrada) is struck on the head by debris and killed. Captain Stacey (Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.) is struck in the face by debris and is blinded.\n\nThe impact knocks a male flight attendant from the upper lounge down to the cabin below. Nancy Pryor (Karen Black), the head flight attendant, rushes up to the flight deck to find Urias gone, Julio dead, and Stacey badly maimed. Fortunately, the captain is able to engage the autopilot and the altitude hold switch to keep the aircraft in the air before losing consciousness.\n\nNancy informs the Salt Lake control tower that the crew is dead or badly injured and that there is no one to fly the plane. She is told to stay on the same radio frequency. Nancy gives the assessment of the damage as a large hole on the starboard side of the flight deck that wiped out most of the instrument gauges over the engineer station.\n\nJoe Patroni (George Kennedy), Columbia's Vice President of Operations, is apprised of Flight 409's situation. He seeks the advice of Captain Al Murdoch (Charlton Heston), Columbia's chief flight instructor, who also happens to be Nancy Pryor's former lover. Patroni takes a personal intrest in Flight 409 because his wife (Susan Clark) is on board the plane with their eldest son.\n\nPatroni and Murdoch take the airline's executive jet to Salt Lake City. En route, they communicate with Nancy, who is still in the cockpit in the pilot's seat. While the autopilot is keeping the aircraft in level flight, it is inoperable for turns. Something has to be done, as the jet is heading into the Wasatch Mountains. After successfully guiding Nancy by radio on how to perform the turn, radio communications are interrupted and the Salt Lake tower is unable to restore contact.\n\nWith the low-flying plane unable to turn, leaking fuel, and dodging the peaks of the Wasatch Mountains, an air-to-air rescue attempt is undertaken from a jet-powered HH-53 Super Jolly Green Giant helicopter flown by the USAF Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Service. While the pilot is preparing to be released on a tether, it becomes apparent that Flight 409 is heading straight into the side of a mountain. With radio communications still out, Nancy flies the plane unaided.\n\nThe badly wounded Captain Stacey is able to give a cryptic clue regarding the decrease in airspeed during a climb in altitude. Nancy realizes that she must accelerate the engines to be able to climb over the mountain and successfully does so. After Flight 409 has leveled off, the pilot is released on a tow line from the helicopter towards the stricken airliner. Just as Nancy is helping him in, the release cord from his harness becomes caught in the jagged metal surrounding the hole in the cockpit. As he climbs in, his harness is released from the tether and he falls to his death.\n\nThe only other person on the helicopter who can land a 747 is Captain Murdock. He is tethered to the rear of the helicopter, lowered to the jet and successfully enters it through the hole in the cockpit. Despite the controls being smashed and with serious damage to the landing breaks, he then lands the plane safely at Salt Lake City Airport, where the flight attendants successfully conduct an emergency evacuation of the passengers via the inflatable slides on the left side of the 747. Patroni is reunited with his wife and son, and Nancy and Captain Murdock walk away from the damaged plane."

    "Aiyaary": "Indian Army Chief COAS General Pratap Malik (Vikram Gokhale) authorizes the formation of a covert Secret Operations unit DSD (Data Systems Diagnostics), a classified off the books intelligence Unit, directly under Army Chief's control, capable of Clandestine missions and operations behind enemy lines. He selects Colonel Abhay Singh (Manoj Bajpayee) to command the unit. Abhay Singh chooses Seven Army Officers for this new unit. Maj. Jai Bakshi (Sidharth Malhotra), Lt.Col Anees and Capt. Maya Semwal (Pooja Chopra) are his first recruits. Over the years, Abhay along with his unit conduct several successful high-profile covert operations in various parts of the world.\n\nOne day while conducting Telephone surveillance in South Block, New Delhi, Jai overhears a representative of Indian Arms lobby Lt.Gen Gurinder Singh (Kumud Mishra), an ex Army officer, attempting to bribe the Army chief, on behalf of a Czech firm, with a USD $2.5 Mn offer. The Army Chief flatly refuses and rebuffs the offer. This angers Gurinder who in turn reveals that he is well aware about DSD's existence and its functioning and before leaving, threatens to expose it to the general public. This alarms the Army Chief who immediately contacts the Defence Minister and informs about a foreign Military-Industrial nexus trying to influence the Indian Arms' Market through Gurinder Singh. The Defence Minister however refuses to intervene, leaving the Army Chief to deal with them himself. He however warns the Army Chief about the possible repercussions, should the existence of DSD become a public knowledge.\n\nMeanwhile, Jai, while listening to all this suspects a major scam involving the Indian Army. He conducts several more illegal Telephone Surveillance missions, in addition to those authorized by Abhay Singh, so as to get the full picture. After 2 months of continuous surveillance, Jai goes rogue. He along with his Girlfriend Sonia (Rakul Preet Singh), escape India and head to London, carrying along with him, highly sensitive Data drives which he stole from DSD HQ. Capt. Maya informs Abhay about Jai going rogue and the theft of highly sensitive Data from DSD Office. Abhay activates his intelligence network and launches a manhunt for Jai. Through his sources Abhay comes to know about Jai's plan of leaving along with Sonia. He raids Jai's house but doesn't find anything worthwhile, even Jai's mother is completely unaware about him going rogue.\n\nAll this while, a corrupt Army Officer Brig. K Srinivas, spies on Abhay's movements and keeps reporting them to Gen Gurinder. Abhay however outsmarts Srinivas and successfully manages to escape. DSD meanwhile shift their office to an undisclosed location, abandoning their existing Office. Lt.Gen Gurinder Singh, seeing his plan of capturing Abhay fail, contacts an influential journalist. He provides her with sensitive information, exposing Army's secrets and asks her to run a smear campaign against the current Army Chief along with giving a good PR to the forthcoming Army Chief.\n\nWhile all this is going on, Gen. Malik personally meets Abhay and informs about the termination of DSD, Foreign involvement in Indian Defence Deals and Lt.Gen Gurinder Singh's involvement with a powerful London based Arms Dealer Mukesh Kapoor (Adil Hussain), who's the major culprit behind all this fiasco. General Malik further informs Abhay that once the information about DSD goes public, Abhay will be declared a traitor and thrown out of the Army, along with his team.\n\nAbhay however remains unperturbed and promises Gen. Malik, that he will expose the wrongdoings and punish all those involved in the scam so as to protect the integrity of Indian Army. After the meeting, with Srinivas still tracking him, Abhay heads to the DSD office, where he informs his team that they have been disavowed, with Government denying their existence. Abhay and Maya alert all their sources and order them to keep a low profile, so as to avoid detection. While this is going on, Jai calls Abhay and they end up having a war of words, with Jai warning Abhay to leave everything and run and Abhay labeling Jai, a coward and a traitor. At that very moment, Brig. Srinivas makes his move, but fails to capture the DSD and its members. Abhay flies off to London, in pursuit of Jai, while DSD members stay back in India.\n\nIn London, Jai calls and threatens Gurinder in renegotiating a deal, revealing that he has bugged Gurinder's house. The frightened Gurinder reluctantly agrees and transfers the money to Jai's accounts. Abhay meanwhile has also reached London. He contacts a London-based immigrant Tariq Bhai (Anupam Kher), who is known to be a middle-man for Intelligence agents. Tariq Bhai and Abhay attempt to locate Jai and Sonia, but fail. However, their activities alert Jai, who orders them to back off, but Abhay refuses and instead vows to hunt him down.\n\nFinally, out of desperation, Abhay contacts Mukesh Kapoor and fixes a meeting with him. At the same time Jai also fixes a meeting with a few MI-6 Officers. Abhay reveals to Mukesh that Jai possesses sensitive incriminating data, which can badly affect his business and therefore asks Mukesh to eliminate Jai. Mukesh, however is suspicious of Abhay but is forced to accept the offer, when Abhay reveals his knowledge of Mukesh's identity as that of an ex Indian Army Colonel and capture of Gurinder Singh by DSD. However, Abhay double crosses Mukesh by informing Sonia about the threat to Jai's life and orders her to lure Jai to an undisclosed location. Jai's meeting ends up in an shootout with 2 MI-6 agents getting killed and he himself getting wounded. Jai however makes it to the place, where Abhay and Sonia are waiting for him.\n\nAbhay, on seeing Jai, severely beats him and derides him as a traitor. Jai however justifies his actions and accuses the Indian system of harboring corrupt and eliminating those who raise a voice against corruption. Abhay mocks Jai's justification, by calling it a lame excuse and insults his generation, but Jai counters this by stating that it was the older generation who was responsible for the massive corruption in India. Jai further questions the legacy that the older generation plans to leave for the youth, thus forcing Abhay to agree with him.\n\nMeanwhile, Mukesh, angry at being fooled, takes Tariq Bhai hostage and plans to execute him, but is forced to stop when Jai informs him that he will surrender all the sensitive information regarding Mukesh Kapoor's deals and requests for a personal meeting. Mukesh, realizing that Abhay still has Gurinder Singh, reluctantly agrees. Jai informs Abhay about a major Army housing scam in Mumbai, involving Gurinder Singh and the defense minister. He further tells that the only eyewitness to the entire scam, a watchman named Baburao Shastri (Naseeruddin Shah) is being hidden by Jai in a small hotel in Paharganj, Delhi.\n\nAbhay immediately heads back to India and meets Baburao, who confesses to him, about the irregularities in a major Army housing project in Colaba, Mumbai and the involvement of several senior bureaucrats and Army Officers lead by Gurinder Singh. Abhay records Baburao's confessions and gives them to the same influential journalist who earlier had met Gurinder Singh. The journalist is revealed to be Abhay Singh's ex Girlfriend, who tells him that she plans to run Gurinder's story tomorrow. Abhay gives her Baburao's confession and requests her to listen to both the stories and run the story which she finds fit. The Journalist listens to both the stories and decides to run Abhay's story, thus deciding to expose the Army's housing Scam.\n\nMeanwhile, Brig. Srinivas finally captures all the DSD members and frees a captured Gurinder Singh. But it is of no use as the DSD is absolved of all the crimes and Army's Housing Scam gets exposed. Gurinder Singh, overcome with shame, shoots himself dead. In the ending scene, Jai pays a final visit to Abhay before vanishing for good and Abhay is shown performing his duties as usual."

    "Akhanda": "In an impenetrable forest, the Indian Army is under severe hunt for a terrifying brigand named Gajendra Sahu. During that encounter, Gajendra Sahu is gravely wounded, and is rescued by a chieftain of a religious organization Maha Rudra Peetam. Upon which, Gajendra listens to the chieftain proclaiming the presence of God is in nature, which must be protected, and the public always bowed their head down before the chieftain because of his chair. Due to this, Gajendra conquers it by slaying the chieftain and cabals to play with nature. Before dying, the chieftain states never to challenge fate, creator, and the universe as he is not able to cope with its reply.\n\nAt the same time, a couple Ramachandraiah and Dharani at Anantapur are blessed with twins in which one is stillborn. Suddenly, an Aghora arrives when the mother is asleep and reveals that one is nature and stillborn is a cataclysm of nature, like that of Lord Shiva's anger. Ramachandraiah cuts the cords, and handover the child to Aghora, who is sent to Kaasi. While the child rises alive when placed at the sanctum, and is raised under the protection of the Aghoras.\n\nYears later, Murali Krishna is an arbiter, who is esteemed as a deity. He aims to eradicate factionalism so that the terrain flourishes from four sides. Saranya Bachupally is a newly appointed DC whose acquaintance with Murali Krishna initiates a contretemps that turns into a crush after learning of his ideologies. Antahpuram Varadarajulu, a gangster, illegally manages illegal mining of uranium extraction in a reversed forest. The laborers are subjected to inhumane conditions and treated as slaves. Gajendra Sahu paves the path to Varadarajulu as a soul. Since it is green soil, Saranya assigns Principal Secretary Padmavati to make a secret inquiry.\n\nMeanwhile, Murali Krishna and Saranya get married and are blessed with a baby girl. One day, multiple children in the region had strange maladies, and doctors are unable to detect the cause behind them. Murali Krishna seeks the government authorities when Padmavati divulges the savagery activities of Varadarajulu, and predicts it should be hindered swiftly. Otherwise, the region becomes a huge graveyard. Listening to it, Murali Krishna flares up on Varadarajulu when he is impeded by his acolyte Central Minister Bharat Reddy and retrieves him to the hospital. At that point, Varadarajulu moves to Gajendra Sahu who ruses by planting a bomb at the hospital leaving several deaths including Bharat Reddy. Following, Murali Krishna is incriminated and prisoned by NIA headed by Krishnamacharya Perumal.\n\nEventually, Murali Krishna's kid also becomes a victim and Saranya rushes to the city hospital. On the way, they are attacked by Varadarajulu's men while absconding she enters an ancient cave temple, where Akhanda Rudra Sikandar Aghora, Murali Krishna's brother with supernatural powers, who is proceeding under the mission of reinstating temples. He assaults blackguards, bounces back the baby to life, and safely drops them. Being cognizant of it, Gajendra Sahu is frightened and grasps Akhanda as the answer of God. Besides, DSP Ranjan, the younger brother of Varadarajulu apprehends Saranya and the entire family. On the verge to slay them, Akhanda appears to eliminate the wicked officers. Forthwith, he interrupts Gajendra Sahu's ritual by throwing Ranjan's dead body and giving him an ultimatum.\n\nMeanwhile, Dharani learns the fact when she rebukes them and decides to recoup her son. Akhanda proclaims that his life is dedicated to the lord which perturbs the mother as she lost the two. Anyhow, Akhanda develops unknown affection for the baby. Once, Akhanda spots Padmavati at a river and detects it through his yogic powers. She had been tortured and suffered to the state by Varadarajulu, due to uncovering the scam. Therefore, he onslaughts on Varadarajulu at the mining area, foredo him and frees the laborers. Currently, Krishnamacharya Perumal departs to seize Akhanda for the bloodbath. As soon as he responds that the extreme from this world and men who try to disturb the balance of nature need to be eradicated. Simultaneously, Krishnamacharya Perumal is aware Murali Krishna is non-guilty via Padmavati and acquits him.\n\nLater, Gajendra Sahu contacts a Kapalik tantrik, Prachanda to kill Akhanda. Ergo, they spell cursed death over the baby when Akhanda gives a call to Kedari Aghori Baba from Kaasi who foretells to conduct Maha Mrityunjay Homam. Until the completion of the ritual, Akhanda is captive to Shiva, where Gajendra Sahu and Prachanda devise a trap and wallop on him. However, Akhanda bears the pain and finishes the ritual successfully with aid of Murali Krishna. At last, Akhanda manifests him with mighty powers from Shiva, where he wreaks havoc and kills Gajendra and Prachanda. After this, Akhanda leaves, but he promises the child that he will be back if they are in trouble again."

    "Akira": "On July 16, 1988 an atom bomb vaporizes Tokyo. 31 years after WW3 in 2019, Neo-Tokyo has risen, a decrepit city filled with violence and desolation. In a grungy part of town, a man goes to a bar where the bartender (Y\u00f4suke Akimoto) sells drugs to a customer and the TV recaps the day's news. There is unrest due to unemployment and a bad economy. A young man, wearing a red biker suit, enters the bar and gathers some friends from a back room, announcing that they will be going after the Clowns, a rival bike gang, on Route 5. Outside, a younger teen, Tetsuo (Nozomu Sasaki, English: Jan Rabson), is admiring a bright red motorcycle with special technical features. Kaneda (Mitsuo Iwata, English: Cam Clarke), the youth in the red suit and the leader of the Capsules biker gang, walks out of the bar and mocks Tetsuo, telling him he doesn't possess the skill to operate the bike, which belongs to Kaneda. The bosozoku gang rides out into the night.\n\nThey meet the Clowns at the designated area, chasing them through the skyscraper district where the Clowns are knocked off their bikes. Bystanders watch as nearby cars are damaged and bombed by the violence. In the skirmish, Tetsuo wipes out and is left alone as the police arrive and the gangs split up.\n\nAt the same time, a wounded man, dripping blood, leads a short, green-skinned person through the night streets. He pulls a gun and shoots a pair of pursuing dogs. The man is eventually stopped by police near a group of rioting protesters and, in the chaos, is shot to death. The little green person cries out in terror as a building begins to collapse. The crowd scrambles for safety and a mustached man and his companion, a young woman named Kei (Mami Koyama, English: Lara Cody), are split up.\n\nMeanwhile, Kaneda's gang continues to pursue the Clowns. Tetsuo chases a Clown on his own and they approach the scene where police are attempting to hold back rioters with water cannons and tear gas. Tetsuo closes in on the Clown, wearing a red cross logo, as the rider wipes out. Tetsuo rides by and viciously hits the downed man on the head. When Tetsuo looks up, he sees the green person standing in his path. There is a crash and an explosion. Kaneda and the rest of the gang arrive on the scene to find Tetsuo semi-conscious in the street while the green person walks away, unhurt. Kaneda calls out to him but the person disappears into the darkness. A second green-skinned person then arrives in a hovering chair and speaks to the other in a child's voice, beckoning him to return and saying 'there is no escape'. A helicopter with an armed paramilitary group lands in the square and forces the Capsules gang to the ground as a tall man with a jarhead haircut emerges from the helicopter. Colonel Shikishima (Tar\u00f4 Ishida, English: Tony Pope) sends Tetsuo to the hospital while Kaneda and his gang are taken into custody before he leaves in the helicopter with the two green children.\n\nAt the police station, Kaneda and his gang are interrogated, while feigning innocence. Eight of the Clowns have been put in the hospital, but they come up with an alibi; Being that they were going to visit his dying mother and got attacked by the clowns. The police check their alibi put them on a bench, where several members of the street riot are also awaiting interrogation. Kaneda notices Kei being held with another group of suspects. Suddenly, a radical member of the freedom revolution goes mad and activates a grenade in the middle of the station, attempting to kill himself and the police. The grenade, however, turns out to be defective, and the nearby police subdue him. The other police officers then inform the capsules that they have contacted their school and therefore find their alibi plausible, releasing them from custody. Kaneda uses this as an opportunity to free Kei as well by stating that she's one of them too. Unknown to him, she is a member of a terrorist organization though she teases him for attempting to flirt by freeing her before she slips away. Still not knowing her name, Kaneda yells at her, right as an explosion happens at the police station.\n\nMeanwhile, at the hospital, Tetsuo is placed in a full-body scanner. His status is overseen by Doctor Onishi (Mizuho Suzuki, English: Lewis Arquette), who suddenly makes an alarming discovery. He contacts Shikishima who is in a meeting with a politician, discussing a possible 'mole' on the Executive Council. Arriving at the hospital, Shikishima is told by Onishi that Tetsuo possesses psychic abilities similar to Akira, a young esper like the two green children, who caused the nuclear-like destruction of Tokyo 31 years prior. Project Akira was sprung from a secret government lab run by a dissident, underground terrorist group, but there was an error involving the growth pattern. Onishi claims that Tetsuo possesses the key to solving that dilemma. However, Shikishima is concerned about Tetsuo's power and, after receiving a prophesy from the esper Kiyoko (Fukue It\u00f4, English: Melora Harte) envisioning Neo-Tokyo's destruction, instructs Onishi to kill Tetsuo if he thinks the power might get out of control.\n\nOnce awakened, however, Tetsuo escapes from the hospital and makes his way toward the hideout for the Capsules gang in a vandalized wreck of a building. There, the rest of the gang is recuperating with girlfriends from the evening's events, discussing their surprise of the cooperation between police and the army. A timid young girl, Kaori (Yuriko Fuchizaki, English: Michelle Ruff), expresses her concern for her boyfriend, Tetsuo. Suddenly, he appears and proposes that they run away together. They steal Kaneda's bike and ride off, but not before Kaneda and the others see him leaving.\n\nTetsuo and Kaori ride until the bike stalls. They are then confronted by three Clowns who accost Kaori and threaten to torch the bike. Kaneda and the rest of the Capsules arrive and help Tetsuo fight off the Clowns. Tetsuo, however, angry at having to be rescued, takes his frustrations out on a fallen Clown, kicking him fiercely. He begins to suffer a severe migraine, hallucinating that his internal organs have dropped out of his lower chest and hearing the word 'Akira'. Not a moment later, a CRC team arrives by armored vehicle and helicopters. Having pinpointed his location via a scanning device, Doctor Onishi has Tetsuo taken back to the hospital, leaving Kaneda and his gang to wonder about what's going on.\n\nNearby an explosion rocks a building and police shoot and kill fleeing armed men. Kaneda is drawn to the violence and sees a mustached man fleeing with Kei. Kaneda follows her as police flashlights bracket her attempt to escape. Kaneda assists Kei in escaping as a cop is shot and killed. When they reach the resistance headquarters, Kei frantically calls out for the moustached man named Ryu (Tessh\u00f4 Genda, English: Bob Buchholz), while Kaneda tries to convince her to turn herself in for killing the officer (not knowing what's really happening). Just then, Ryu and some resistance fighters arrive and, mistaking Kaneda for a spy, lock him up inside a room. There, they discuss their earlier failed attempt at kidnapping #26, which turns out to be the first green esper child, Takashi (Tatsuhiko Nakamura, English: Barbara Goodson). He proposes a new plan to gain access to a government facility to find what they can on the newest subject: Tetsuo. After being discovered eavesdropping, Kaneda explains to the suspicious group that he and Tetsuo are best friends from the same gang and that he can help. Ryu seeks advice from a short, old man named Nezu (Hiroshi \u00d4take, English: Mike Reynolds) who speaks of Akira as a symbol for hope and change while he watches the fires and protests in the city streets from afar.\n\nMeanwhile, Tetsuo experiences memories from his days as a boy. Suddenly, his memories turn into a nightmarish hallucination. Colonel Shikishima approaches an aged green-skinned esper girl; Kiyoko, sitting inside a crib while Onishi scans readings. Kiyoko is seen to have a '25' tattooed on her palm. She makes an ominous prediction. Shikishima flies out with a few scientists and don parkas before entering a large, oval-like facility. They enter the frigid space and begin activating some of the equipment within. A massive door slowly opens and the Colonel enters the cavernous chamber. A small, red light and sign reads 'Akira 28'.\n\nColonel Shikishima then attends a meeting with the Supreme Executive Council where he is angered by the members' refusal to further fund his project. He questions them, stating that his intents are the duties of a soldier before he angrily, and abruptly, leaves. Council member Nezu smiles at the Colonel's distress.\n\nIn his hospital room within the government facility, Tetsuo experiences bizarre hallucinations of a toy rabbit, a teddy bear, a toy car and milk. Confused about what's happening, Tetsuo steps out on a glass and cuts his foot which startles the three green children responsible for the hallucinations; Takashi, Kiyoko, and Masaru (Kazuhiro Kand\u00f4, English: Bob Bergen). Frightened at the sight of blood, the esper children flee despite their attempt to kill Tetsuo. Angered and realizing the power he holds, Tetsuo chases after them through the hospital, killing anyone who stands in his way and wreaking havoc with his telekinetic abilities.\n\nMeanwhile, the Resistance group, having made it into the facility disguised as electrical workers, are spotted sneaking in the sewers and a chase ensues. During the violent shootout, Kaneda manages to take over a flying platform, a small aerial vehicle flown by soldiers, and takes Kei as they flee the scene. However, they are quickly detained by soldiers. Using Kei as a medium and possessing her, Kiyoko leads them to a government nursery where Tetsuo is located. Kaneda faces Tetsuo, explaining that he's here to rescue him, but Tetsuo won't have it. He angrily retorts that he needs no rescuing now and, since he's discovered where Akira is, is eager to find out what he is, hoping to make his headaches go away. Possessing stronger powers than the three espers, Tetsuo manages to escape and uses his abilities to fly away; his destination is the Neo-Tokyo Olympic Stadium under which Akira is being held in a cryogenic storage facility.\n\nDesperate to find and stop Tetsuo, Colonel Shikishima places Neo-Tokyo under martial law. Tetsuo leaves a trail of destruction through the city before he stops at the bar seen at the start of the film, still wearing his hospital gown, and approaches the bartender, now alone. Tetsuo demands 'capsules' before we see two of his fellow Capsule gang members, Yamagata (Masaaki \u00d4kura, English: Michael Lindsay) and Kai (Takeshi Kusao, English: Matthew Mercer) walk in from outside. They find the inside of the bar totally destroyed and the bartender lying dead as Tetsuo sits on a pile of rubble and furniture, giggling. Perplexed and disgusted, they wonder if the person they see is really Tetsuo or someone else. Tetsuo speaks to them cryptically before intimidating and attacking them.\n\nHaving been left behind and locked once more in a holding cell, Kei is used again by Kiyoko to speak to Kaneda, warning him of Tetsuo's immense power. The cell door unlocks and the two escape. Meanwhile, a government representative arrives to arrest Shikishima but the Colonel's men remain loyal to him and assist the Colonel in a coup d'etat. He mobilizes his men to the stadium. Nezu, the government mole, listens to this report from home and murders his staff before Ryu arrives to inform him of the mission's failure to capture Tetsuo. Nezu shoots him and leaves with a briefcase full of money. However, he later dies in an alley from a heart attack. Having followed him, Ryu also dies from his wounds.\n\nKai manages to find Kaneda and Kei at an urban water-filled ditch and explains that he and Yamagata found Tetsuo, who acted strangely and somehow killed Yamagata. Angered by the news of his friend's death, Kaneda vows vengeance. Takashi and Kiyoko then appear, beckoning Kei who walks over the water before disappearing. Kiyoko tells Kaneda and Kai that Tetsuo's powers have become unstable and they are trying to stop him. Kaneda argues that Tetsuo is his friend and that he is responsible for finding a way to defeat and kill him.\n\nTetsuo makes his way towards the stadium, killing soldiers in his path and destroying vehicles and helicopters. Possessed by Kiyoko once again, Kei attempts to fight him but is thrown aside. Tetsuo exhumes Akira's entire cryonic chamber from the ground and opens it but finds nothing aside from dissected body parts housed in individual canisters. Kaneda, armed with an experimental laser cannon, rides into the chaos and confronts Tetsuo. As they fight, Shikishima intervenes with an orbital weapon called SOL, the beam of which severs Tetsuo's right arm. Enraged, Tetsuo flies into space and rips SOL out of orbit, causing it to disintegrate in the atmosphere. He then returns to the stadium where Kaori arrives, finding him screaming in pain due to his intense powers while he synthesizes an artificial, mechanical arm using the remains from Akira. The arm seems to throb with a life of its own. Shikishima finds Tetsuo and explains to him that the espers' mind-controlling drugs administered to Tetsuo were meant to stunt the evolution of his uncontrollable abilities, but they are weakening. He pleads with Tetsuo to return to the hospital but Tetsuo attacks him. Shikishima shoots back and Kaneda appears, intervening.\n\nThe three espers arrive at the stadium and appear to try and communicate with the remains of Akira in the canisters. Unable to control his powers any longer, Tetsuo's body begins to morph: his arm transforms into a horrific blob that attempts to swallow the Colonel. Kaneda shoots it, causing it to recede but Tetsuo's entire body swells into a protoplasmic mutation, crushing Kaori to death in the process. Kaneda escapes as the espers awaken Akira; now appearing as a young boy without the need for a physical body. His appearance triggers a monstrous explosion and Kiyoko grabs Shikishima, transporting him to safety in the nick of time. Akira creates a blinding ball of energy that engulfs the entire city and begins to absorb Tetsuo who cries out for Kaneda's help. Desperate to save his friend, Kaneda follows Tetsuo into the energy sphere, followed closely by the three espers who are determined to save Kaneda, though they observe that they might not return.\n\nKaneda experiences Tetsuo's and Akira's childhood memories, seeing how much Tetsuo trusted Kaneda and witnessing how the three esper children were first studied upon just before Tokyo's destruction. The espers tell Tetsuo that Akira is sending him 'away', but somewhere safe as Kaneda is ejected from the inside of the sphere, just before it explodes. The explosion partially destroys most of Neo-Tokyo, leaving a gaping hole where the sphere was that is quickly flooded by the sea. Doctor Onishi is killed when his laboratory collapses.\n\nKaneda awakens and is reunited with Kei and Kai. Together, they ride away on their damaged bikes to start anew. Colonel Shikishima emerges from the tunnel where he was placed by Kiyoko and watches as the sun rises over the destroyed city.\n\nElsewhere, a cosmic 'bang' breaches the darkness and a voice speaks out, \"I am Tetsuo.\" Coming into full control of his powers, he initiates a new universe."

    "Alexander": "The story begins around 285 BC, with Ptolemy I Soter (Anthony Hopkins), who narrates throughout the film. Ptolemy narrates that history made Alexander better than he was. The Persians ruled to the East. Greece was in decline and the Persians bribed Greek kings to fight as mercenaries in their army. King Phillip changed this by uniting Greece under a single King. He built a professional army. The Persians assassinated Phillip, and Alexander came to power. Alexander wanted revenge and conquered all cities of Western Asia and Egypt, where he crowned as Pharaoh. Finally, Alexander took on the Persian empire with the battle at Babylon.\n\nIn 334 BC, 45,000 Greeks against 100,000 Persians led by King Darius. Hephaestion is Alexander's lover. The Persians have cavalry and chariots, which Alexander counters with legions of phalanxes. Alexander is a skill-full commander in battle. He opens up a hole in the Darius lines by luring one part of his army by offering himself as the bait. The Greek army attacks into the hole, and Alexander almost kills Darius, forcing him to withdraw from the battlefield. Persian empire was destroyed and at the age of 25, Alexander was the King of all.\n\nAlexander (Colin Farrell) grows up with his mother Olympias (Angelina Jolie) and his tutor Aristotle (Christopher Plummer), where he finds interest in love, honor, music, exploration, poetry and military combat. Olympias was a sorcerers and Alexander was considered by some to be a son of Zeus. Philip hated Olympias, who never let Philip touch her. Hephaestion & Alexander trained together. Aristotle teaches Alexander that a gay relationship is not natural. Men can be friends. A Man cannot love a woman as she is purely driven by passion. These ideas were taught to him in childhood. Aristotle showed him the way to India and back to Greece. But he also warns that the East has a way of swallowing men's dreams and lives. Which is why Greece has never conquered the East yet.\n\nHis relationship with his father, Philip II (Val Kilmer) of Macedon, is destroyed when Philip marries Attalus's (Nick Dunning) niece, Eurydice (Marie Meyer). Olympia tells Alexander that the son of Philip and Eurydice will be a pure Macedonian, unlike Alexander, and hence will have first right to the throne. Olympia wants Alexander to marry a Macedonian, or declare civil war against Philip. Alexander calls her mad. She tries to convince Alexander that Zeus is his real father and Philip never wanted him. Alexander insults Philip after disowning Attalus as his kinsman (Attalus had toasted Eurydice as the legit queen and her future sons as the legit Macedonian sons at Philip's wedding), which results in Alexander's banishment from Philip's palace.\n\nAfter Philip is assassinated in 336 BC, Alexander is proclaimed the King of Macedonia in the ensuing chaos. His supporters move quickly, take advantage of the public mood and crown him King, even though Eurydice had a son. Alexander suspects Olympia of being behind the assassination. That was the last time Alexander saw Olympia. He had Attlus, Eurydice and her son killed. Ptolemy mentions Alexander's punitive campaign in which he razes Thebes, also referring to the later burning of Persepolis, then gives an overview of Alexander's west-Persian campaign, including his declaration as the son of Zeus by the Oracle of Amun at Siwa Oasis, his great battle against the Persian Emperor Darius III (Raz Degan) in the Battle of Gaugamela, and his eight-year campaign across Asia.\n\nBack in the present, Alexander enters the rich city of Babylon. Alexander meets Bagoas in Babylon and is attracted to him. He treats Darius's queen with respect and grants her the status of his own family. Olympia wants to be brought to Babylon as Queen, but Alexander is not too keen on it. Alexander continues to chase Darius across Persia in 329 BC, and finds his dead body at a riverbed where Darius had been betrayed by his own commanders. Alexander then chased the commanders until he killed them all. All cities that stood in his way were burnt down and destroyed. He marries a commoner from Bactria, a woman of no political significance. The woman was Roxana.\n\nAfter 7 long yrs away from Macedonia, Alexander's commanders don't understand what they are doing so far away from home, building roads and cities for barbarians. Alexander seeks an Asian empire with him as king. They are upset with Alexander marrying Roxana and want a Macedonian heir. The commanders can see that Alexander lusts for war.\n\nAlso seen are Alexander's private relationships with his childhood friend Hephaestion (Jared Leto), Bagoas (Francisco Bosch), and later his wife, Roxana (Rosario Dawson). Hephaestion compares Alexander to Achilles, to which Alexander replies that Hephaestion must be his Patroclus (Achilles' lover). When Hephaestion mentions that Patroclus died first, Alexander pledges that, if Hephaestion should die first, he will follow him into the afterlife (as Achilles had done for Patroclus). Hephaestion shows extensive jealousy when he sees Alexander with Roxana, and deep sadness when he marries her. Roxana sees Alexander embracing Hephaestion and does not trust him. Olympia warns Alexander not to chase his dreams further east and asks him to return to Babylon or Macedonia to strengthen the empire. Philotas (Joseph Morgan) is found guilty to be leading a conspiracy against Alexander and is executed after trial. Alexander orders his loyal father Parmenion (John Kavanagh) to be executed as well, as Parmenion was in charge of guarding his supply lines to the East. Alexander is shown to sleep with Bagoas.\n\nAlexander marches his army of 150,000 soldiers through the passes of Hindu Kush into the promised lands of India. Roxana bore no sons even after 2 yrs of marriage. He reaches India in 327 BC. He finds monkeys, sadhus, rain and forests. He found no gold. The army became restless as even conquered lands were returned to their kings to make them allies. Hephaestion attempts to keep Roxana away from him after Alexander murders Cleitus the Black (Gary Stretch) in India. Cleitus got drunk and started by saying that he wanted to be back in Macedonia. He then insulted Alexander by calling him a lesser King to previous Greeks. He then insults his love for Asia and the barbarians, a woman who cant bear sons. He calls him the son of Zeus, and thus a bastard of Philip and thus his mother a whore. At this point an enraged Alexander kills Cleitus. Cleitus was a trusted general of Philip.\n\nAfter initial objection from his soldiers (40,000 had died in the quest to the East), Alexander convinces them (Alexander killed the commanders of the mutiny and this divided his army) to join him in his final and bloodiest battle, the Battle of Hydaspes against Porus. Porus deploys an army of elephants that trample the core of Alexander's army. Alexander personally leads a charge to rally his troops against the enemy. He is severely injured with an arrow but survives and is celebrated. Alexander orders a return back to Macedonia. Alexander chose the shortest route back through the Arabian desert. This was the worst blunder of his life and many more thousands died on the way back. Back home, he took 2 more wives. Alexander's army was made of Persians and Macedonians. His generals questioned his every decision. While his regional Satraps had dubious loyalties. He orders the construction of Alexandria.\n\nLater on, Hephaestion succumbs to an unknown illness either by chance or perhaps poison, speculated in the film to be typhus carried with him from India. Alexander, full of grief and anger, distances himself from his wife, despite her pregnancy, believing that she has killed Hephaestion. He dies less than three months after Hephaestion, in the same manner, keeping his promise that he would follow him. On his deathbed, Bagoas grieves as Alexander's generals begin to split up his kingdom and fight over the ownership of his body. He died on 10th June, 323 BC in Babylon. He was 33 yrs old. Within 40 yrs, the empire was split into 4 parts. Cassander (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) kills Olympias 7 yrs after his death. He then executes Roxana and her 13 yr old son, 6 yrs after that.. Alexander's bloodline was finished.\n\nThe story then returns to 285 BC, where Ptolemy admits to his scribe that he, along with all the other officers, had indeed poisoned Alexander just to spare themselves from any future conquests or consequences (mixed races with the Asians). However, he has it recorded that Alexander died due to illness compounding his overall weakened condition. He then goes on to end his memoirs with praise to Alexander.\n\nThe movie then ends with the note that Ptolemy's memoirs of Alexander were eventually burned, lost forever with the Library of Alexandria."

    "Alien Hunter": "In the North Pole, a strange huge white egg-like thing is found. Some scientists take the thing to the laboratory. At first, the sceptical people are the ones who are listened to by the politicians. Dr. Kate Brecher (Janine Eser) is worried about the thing. She thinks it's not only spacial rubbish, but a kind of alien container which may become dangerous.\n\nJulian Rome (James Spader) is an expert in computer language. There are a kind of strange transmission he's getting, but he seems not to be able to crack it. A Russian submarine is in the watchout. They are approaching the polar base fast. The crew don't look happy at all.\n\nAt the beginning, they think that the alien object is a kind of rock, but first results show that there is a kind of carbon alloy, which has never been seen before on planet Earth. The scientists decide to open the box with a laser beam and special machinery, like a stronger welder. At that very same moment, Julian has the idea to treat the mysterious message as a kind of labyrinth. He re-programs the computer and a new message seems to appear, repeated over and over again: the sentence DO NOT OPEN appears over and over again. Julian and Shelly Klein (Aimee Graham) run to tell the rest of the crew to leave the alien box alone, but it's too late. Something seems to be moving inside the white cocoon. As soon as he enters the huge warehouse, there is an explosion. Everything seems to blow up.\n\nWhen the explosion is over, they start looking around for casualties. One of the scientists says that she doesn't feel very well, and at that moment she falls to the floor, - as though she were a ragged doll - and the body gets kinda deflated. She is not the only one: two other people suffer the same almost immediate death.\n\nDr. John Bachman (Roy Dotrice) starts wondering what the alien will do when they capture it. The lights have gone off, so they have to find the fuse in the dark, lit by weak torches.\n\nJulian's light falls to the floor. At that moment, he realises that the alien is close by. The alien moves slowly towards him. It feels attracted to the torch until it goes off. Then, the bigger-than-a-human creature faces Julian attentively. It is a wet alien, who hugs Julian's head. Julian has visions of a foreign planet.\n\nJulian and the rest of the survivors - 7 all in all - finally communicate with their base; they finally get to talk with Bachman and his advisors. They are informed that an alien contact has happened before - in Roswell, New Mexico, USA. The aliens have a virus inside of them which they are immune to, but which can kill any human almost instantly. Infection seems to spread through the air. The alien race which is inside the white cocoon is friendly, but when they tried to talk to the Martians, they killed all the civilization in that planet almost instantly. Bachman tells that the Russian submarine is approaching fast, but that the crew's orders are to contain the infection at all costs, not to rescue the remaining scientists. Bachman also admits - to Julian's question - that the aliens usually communicate through telepathy.\n\nDr. Michael Straub (John Lynch) wants to leave the base immediately, but Julian tells him that nobody can leave the polar station until Shelly has discovered a way to detect the pathogen, fight the infection and cure it. Straub insists, so Julian ends up punching him. T.\n\nDr. Alexi Gierach (Nikolai Binev), the pilot (Anthony Crivello) and the co-pilot (Kaloyan Vodenicharov) have just got their order. They are in shooting range of the base at the same time that some of the scientists try to run away, as Shelly has not been able to identify the pathogen in the blood of the survivors. She has the notion that the pathogen may get hidden inside the proteins and cells of the human body, but at that moment she has no clue.\n\nWhile they are leaving, they have to go through the underground garden in which the scientists used to grow their own vegetables. Michael touches one of the of the corn cobs, and it immediately rottens up. At that moment, he realises that all the humans inside the scientifical compound have sufferd contamination. Julian runs after Michael, who succeeds in reaching the white frozen land surrounding the building.\n\nHowever, there is a kind of twister of energy. It is possible - but difficult - to breathe. Michael keeps on trying to run away, so there are like two bolts of lightning which kill him off. Julian enters again in the building and he tells everybody to leave the building, walk slowly, breath calmly, and as he has just had a telepathic vision of thousands of aliens in their world, he tells everybody to join the two shadows - two aliens - who want to take them to their planet. That way, they will live in a place where there is not risk of them contaminating everything and everybody.\n\nJulian finally convinces everybody, but it looks as though Shelly is left behind. However, on the nick of time, Julian convinces her. The transparent starship leaves with all the remaining survivors. Exactly at that moment, the Russian rocket arrives to its destination, blowing everything up.\n\nThere is a newscast talking about the deaths of Julian, Shelly, Kate... The president is going to make an annoucement about it.\n\nAt exactly that moment, we see the alien spaceship flying away - with the surviving humans inside."

    "Alien Outpost": "The film begins with a couple of text blocks explaining that in 2021 aliens invaded the planet. After crashlanding all over the earth, the next day begin the attacks by the aliens, which are called Heavies. After unifying the planets resources, men begins to fight back and the Heavies are driven off, leaving thousands of Heavies stranded on earth. After most of them have been disposed off, outposts are build to keep the rest of the world save from the remaining Heavies. Most of the people on earth move on and forget about the war, while the outposts are constantly undermanned and understaffed.\n\n10 Years after the initial attack: Three new recruits and their documentary film crew are dropped of in the vicinity of Outpost 37 where they are ordered to serve. They get a short ride from a crew from another outpost, but need to leave the vehicle as enemy fire is detected in the area. They make it to outpost 37 to find it deserted and not respondent to hails. They enter and are pulled into a prank which the crew of outpost 37 plays on all their newcomers.\n\nLater the camera crew is summoned by Captain Spears, who gives them each a gun, telling them that everyone on the base is a combatant. Shortly thereafter the base comes under attack by the local population. The outpost is build within their sovereignty and after 10 years of putting up with it, they are beginning to lose their patience with the soldiers. After calling in air support the locals are driven back, but not before wounding soldier Hollis, who needs to be transferred to the nearest other outpost, Mako, to have a bullet from his shoulder removed.\n\nAfter returning, Captain Spears informs them that Hollis won't be returning, but will be recovering back in the civilized world. He also informs the men that he put in a request for reinforcements, but this request is denied.\n\nThe crew of the outpost teases Frankie, one of the new recruits, about the picture of his mother, which they took and put onto a poster of a topless model.\n\nLater, a new soldier arrives on foot. He is questioned about his coming to outpost 37 and says he volunteered for the assignment, as no reinforcements will be send from command. Saleem, their local translator and friend, comes to visit and tells them they need to follow him to a man who says the soldiers killed his goats during the last attack.\n\nAn attachment of soldiers goes to meet the man, who says the soldiers owe hem twelve goats. Upon examining the goats, the men come to the conclusion they did not kill the goats and suspect a Heavy is in the area. With tensions high a young boy suddenly begins to move toward them. After being stopped by another man, he suddenly explodes and a Heavy appears. Taking heavy fire they retreat, only to find that soldier North has gone missing. After finding his helmet and examining the camera footage from his helmet cam, they see he's taken hostage by a Heavy. The crew wants to go find him, but are thwarted by high ranking officers who came to investigate the case. They are not allowed to leave the base.\n\nAt night, when looking at the camera footage of the area around base, they see Saleem being attacked by a Heavy. They disobey orders and leave to rescue him, as soldier Brick fires a drone, to stop the Heavy. The soldier save Saleem and take the heavily wounded, but still alive Heavy back to base. When Captain Sears finds out, he shoots the Heavy and tells them to follow their orders. Saleem then volunteers to look for North and goes out in his own.\n\nWhen he comes back, he's checked at the gate for bombs, since the boy they saw earlier exploded. He checks out, but Brick, who is in the camera room, sees that Saleem has a very low body temperature. He tries to warn Frankie, but it's too late and Saleem shoots Frankie in the head. Captain Spears bursts out of his office and kills Saleem. After examining the body of Saleem, the doc finds a small incision in the back of Saleems neck. He doesn't know what to make of it.\n\nAfter the funeral of Frankie, Captain Spears orders the men to gear up as they go out to find North. They find him, he is still alive but unconscious, and they bring him back to base. Though he's been shot three times, his vitals are stable and strong. He however doesn't regain consciousness. In the camera room, the men see North's eyelids moving and discover he's using tap code to give them a location. After informing Captain Spears he then asks North, who is still unconscious, what is at that position. Using his eyelid method, North spells out Steel Rain. He then wakes up suddenly and begins to attack Captain Spears, all the while screaming, kill me, kill me! Spears shoots him and North thanks him when he dies. The doc cuts open the scar in Norths neck, only to reveal an alien device which they think is used to control North with.\n\nSpears wants to explore the location given to him by North, but is forbidden so by General Dane. A short while later a combined group of Heavies and locals begins to attack the outpost. After contacting command they are told the attacks are happening all across the outpost line and it will be at least an hour before they can get air support. Gearing up, the men blow cover fire as Andros rigs the base to explode. They leave at the last second and blow up the base, buying the other outpost some time. Brick is killed by a blast from a Heavy while in the truck.\n\nSpears refuses to go to the Mako outpost and asks the men if they are willing to follow him to the coordinates North has given him. They all agree and make their way to the coordinates where they encounter a large alien structure, protected heavily by Heavies and locals alike. After making it into the facilities they find multiple rooms which house the missing soldiers and locals. They all have the same scar in their neck. After more resistance in the structure, they come across a power station, which is gearing up. Spears orders Andros to rig the station to blow as he and the other men give cover fire. After a heavy loss of casualties, in which one of the camera men is fatally wounded, most men run for the exit. The wounded camera man takes the detonation device and is seen exploding the charge as a Heavy comes upon him.\n\nWith the power station, the whole building blows and the soldiers, who are by now in their truck, see the building collapse. Moments later something big falls from the sky. After stopping, Omo investigates. It turns out the building was designed to disrupt the network of defense satellites who have been put around the earth after the first attack. In the moments the building was active, until the time it collapsed, hundreds of pods could come to the barrier to resupply the Heavies who stayed behind after the initial attack. The collapse of the building causes to defensive satellites to regain their effectiveness, stopping more pods and possibly new Heavies, from entering the atmosphere.\n\nAs the film comes to a close the camera man asks what Steel Rain means. The soldier answers with: Second Wave....\n\nMovie ends."

    "Alien Resurrection": "Two hundred years after the events of Alien 3, military scientists on the outer space vessel USM Auriga create a clone of Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) using DNA from blood samples taken before her death. The Alien queen's DNA was mixed in with Ripley's, and the clone grows up with an embryo already inside it. The scientists extract the embryo, raise it, and collect its eggs. The Ripley clone is kept alive for further study. As a result of the alien's DNA inside her, she develops enhanced strength and reflexes, has acidic blood and a psychic link with the Aliens. Also, the alien's genetic memory allows the clone to have some of Ripley's memories.\n\nA group of mercenaries, Elgyn (Michael Wincott), Johner (Ron Perlman), Christie (Gary Dourdan), Vriess (Dominique Pinon), Hillard (Kim Flowers), and Call (Winona Ryder), arrive at Auriga on their ship Betty. They deliver several kidnapped humans in stasis. The military scientists use the kidnapped humans as hosts for the Aliens, raising several adult Aliens for study.\n\nThe Betty crew soon encounters Ripley. Call recognizes her name and tries to kill her, suspecting she may be used to create more Aliens. However, the Aliens have already matured and escape confinement by killing off one of their own and using the acidic blood to burn through their enclosures. They damage the Auriga and kill the crew members who do not manage to evacuate, including General Perez (Dan Hedaya) and Elgyn. Military scientist Dr. Wren (J. E. Freeman) reveals that the ship's default command in an emergency is to return to Earth. Realizing this will unleash the Aliens on Earth, Ripley, the mercenaries, Wren, a Marine named DiStephano (Raymond Cruz), and surviving Alien host Purvis (Leland Orser), decide to head for the Betty and use it to destroy the Auriga. Along the way, Ripley encounters the grotesque products of 7 failed attempts to clone Ripley. The surviving one begs Ripley to mercy kill her, and she complies.\n\nAs the group make their way through the damaged ship, they swim through a flooded kitchen. They are chased by two Aliens. One is killed, while the other snatches Hillard. As they escape the kitchen, the Alien returns and blinds Christie, who sacrifices himself to kill the Alien so the others can escape. After Wren betrays the group, Call is revealed to be an android. Using her ability to interface with the Auriga's systems, Call sets it on a collision course with Earth, hoping to destroy the Aliens in the crash. She cuts off Wren's route of escape and directs the Aliens towards him. Ripley is captured by the Aliens, while the other survivors head for the Betty. There, Wren shoots Purvis and takes Call hostage, demanding that she abort the collision. An injured Purvis violently attacks Wren and forces his head to his chest just as the Alien embryo he is carrying bursts through his rib-cage, causing it to go through Wren's head and kill them both. The survivors then shoot at the embryo.\n\nRipley is taken to the Alien nest, where she witnesses the Queen, now possessing a womb as a result of the genetic mixture, gives birth to a Newborn, a Xenomorph with human traits, such as human teeth, mouth, pale skin color and a human-like face with actual eyes. The hybrid Alien recognizes Ripley as its mother, kills the queen Alien and Dr. Jonathan Gediman (Brad Dourif), a scientist previously captured and cocooned. Ripley takes advantage of the distraction to escape. She makes her way to the Betty.\n\nThe Newborn reaches the Betty and attacks Call. It kills DeStephano when he arrives to help her. Ripley finds her way onto the ship and saves Call by distracting the Newborn. Using her acidic blood, Ripley melts the glass of a window and pushes the Newborn towards the hole. It is violently sucked through the hole due to explosive decompression, while Ripley tearfully watches.\n\nThe countdown on the Auriga continues as the survivors escape in the Betty. The Auriga collides with Earth, causing a large explosion. Call and Ripley look down at Earth, and when Call asks what Ripley wants to do next, she says, \"I'm a stranger here myself.\" In an alternate ending that is used in some extended adaptions, The Betty lands in a ruined Paris."

    "Alien Trespass": "It was a summer night in 1957 in the quiet California desert town of Mojave. Local astronomer Ted Lewis (Eric McCormack) is making a special anniversary dinner for his wife Lana (Jody Thompson). A local diner waitress, Tammy (Jenni Baird) is in her trailer painting a horse scene while Dick (Andrew Dunbar) and Penny (Sarah Smyth) are necking at lovers lane. All are watching the light show from the annual August Perseid meteor showers when suddenly there is a blinding light and crash into the butte just outside of town. Ted attempts to investigate but Lana prevails in keeping him home at least until she falls asleep and he can sneak out to the crash site. In the meantime we see a gruesome alien creature (The Ghota) leaving the spaceship to slip away into the night. Soon after, a tall alien in a silvery metallic suit (Urp) appears from the ship. When Ted arrives at the butte he does not discover a smoking red-hot meteorite but rather a flying saucer imbedded in the hillside with its ramp down. He cautiously enters the saucer and is snatched up by the mysterious silver alien.\n\nTownspeople soon start disappearing everywhere and the only remnant at the scene is a puddle of gurgling mud. Ted Lewis, having been body snatched by Urp, is now on the trail of the murderous Ghota. Urp, is actually a galactic Federal Marshal from another planet who was transporting the Ghota when his saucer crashed landed and the Ghota escaped. He needs to find and recapture the creature before it begins to divide or it will multiply exponentially until all life is consumed on planet Earth. After unsuccessfully trying to convince Lana to help him find the Ghota, Urp meets Tammy on the highway when she offers him a lift. Urp tries his best to convince Tammy of his plight and to help him track down the Ghota. But when they stop at an old derelicts cabin and find only a mud puddle of human remains, Tammy can take no more of the crazy talk and circumstances and leaves him in a huff.\n\nThe teens, Dick & Penny, are on their own track encountering first the Ghota and then the saucer, trying to convince anyone to believe them. Finally they tell their story in the diner to Tammy who now realizes that Urp was telling her the truth. She tries to convey this to the temporary police chief (Dan Lauria) who still refuses to believe there is any real threat, much less from outer space. That is until later when his senior deputy (Robert Patrick) is also dissolved by the Ghota.\n\nThe Ghota is now rampaging through the town dissolving people, cops (and even children) at will. Tammy encounters the Ghota herself while she is closing the diner and makes a narrow escape. Then comes the big scene in the local movie theater where Dick, Penny and Cody (Aaron Brooks) are watching the original 1950s version of The Blob. The Ghota appears at the rear of the theater and begins picking off its prey. All the patrons flee the theater except the teens who are trapped and now stalked by the Ghota. All seems hopeless until Tammy arrives and tries to help, only to become trapped herself with the teens when the Ghotas divided twin suddenly materializes.\n\nThen from the curtain entrance a ray gun blast and then a second stunning shot. The Ghotas are down, but only in stasis as Urp arrives and saves the day. Time to load the Ghotas in Tammys truck and race to the butte so Urp can return Teds body and quickly depart in his spaceship with its deadly cargo.\n\nBut not so fast! Sheriff Dawson and an armed posse of townspeople are hot on their trail and looking for revenge. There is a showdown at the saucer where Tammy stands resolutely between Dawson, the posse and Urp. With an impassioned and compelling speech, Tammy convinces Dawson to put down his gun, let Urp repair his ship, take the immobilized Ghotas and depart Earth in peace. Dawson reluctantly agrees.\n\nThere is a tender goodbye between Urp and Tammy before astronomer Ted is returned to the delight of his wife Lana. Then plumes of smoke and the saucer lifts off to the amazement of the gathered townspeople.\n\nIn the closing scene, as Tammy is driving out of town in her battered pick-up on the way to her new life in Sausalito, she watches the saucer rising over the butte. It stops momentarily in mid-air as Tammy waves dreamily from the cab. The saucer wags a thank you and a final goodbye and then zooms up and away towards a welcomed return to outer space. A 50 year old new movie!"

    "Aliens": "Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is rescued after drifting through space in stasis for 57 years. She is debriefed by her employers at the Weyland-Yutani Corporation over the destruction of her ship, the Nostromo; they are skeptical of her claims that an Alien killed the ship's crew and forced her to destroy the ship. Ripley tries to convince her employers that while she killed the creature, the alien ship itself carried thousands of eggs & if any of those were to make their way to Earth, life would come to an end as these aliens gestate inside living humans.\n\nIn Zeta Reticuli, the Exomoon LV-426, where the USCSS Nostromo encountered the alien eggs, is now home to the Terraforming colony Hadley's Hope with about 60 - 70 families living there for over 20 years to change the planet's atmosphere and make it livable for humans. One of the exploration groups at the station encounters the alien ship & accidentally triggers the breeding process in which one of the eggs hatches and locks itself to the face of the explorer, starting the breeding.\n\nWhen contact is lost with Hadley's Hope, Weyland-Yutani representative Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) and Colonial Marine Lieutenant Gorman (William Hope) ask Ripley to accompany Burke and a Colonial Marine unit to investigate the disturbance. Traumatized by her encounter with the Alien, Ripley initially refuses, but relents after experiencing recurring nightmares about the creature; she makes Burke promise to destroy, and not capture, the Aliens. Aboard the spaceship USS Sulaco, she is introduced to the Colonial Marines and the android Bishop (Lance Henriksen), toward whom Ripley is initially hostile following her experience with the traitorous android Ash aboard the Nostromo.\n\nA drop-ship delivers the expedition to the surface of LV-426, where they find the colony deserted. Inside, they find makeshift barricades and signs of a struggle, but no bodies; two live face-Huggers in containment tanks in the medical lab; and a survivor, a traumatized young girl nicknamed Newt (Carrie Henn) who used the ventilation system to evade capture or death. The crew uses the colony's computer to locate the colonists grouped beneath the fusion powered atmosphere processing station. They head to the location, descending into corridors covered in Alien secretions.\n\nAt the center of the station, the marines find the colonists cocooned, serving as incubators for the Aliens' offspring. When the marines kill a newborn Alien, the Aliens are roused and ambush the marines, killing and capturing several. When the inexperienced Gorman panics, Ripley takes control of their vehicle and rams it through the nest to rescue marines Hicks (Michael Biehn), Hudson (Bill Paxton), and Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein). Hicks orders the drop-ship to recover the survivors, but a stowaway Alien kills the pilots, causing it to crash. Ripley, Newt, Burke and the remaining marines barricade themselves inside the colony.\n\nRipley discovers that Burke deliberately sent the colonists to investigate the derelict spaceship where the Nostromo crew first encountered the Alien eggs, believing he could become wealthy by recovering Alien specimens for use as biological weapons. She threatens to expose him, but Bishop informs the group of a greater danger: the power plant was damaged during the battle and will soon detonate with the force of a 40-megaton thermonuclear weapon. He volunteers to crawl through several hundred meters of piping conduits to reach the colony's transmitter and remotely pilot the Sulaco's remaining drop-ship to the surface.\n\nRipley and Newt fall asleep in the medical laboratory, awakening to find themselves locked in the room with the two face-Huggers, which have been released from their tanks. Ripley triggers a fire alarm to alert the marines, who rescue them and kill the creatures. Ripley accuses Burke of releasing the face-Huggers so that they would impregnate her and Newt, allowing him to smuggle the Alien embryos past Earth's quarantine, and of planning to kill the rest of the marines in hyper-sleep during the return trip so that no one could contradict his version of events. Before the marines can kill Burke, the electricity is cut and Aliens assault through the ceiling. Vasquez and Gorman are killed, while Hudson, Burke, and Newt are captured.\n\nRipley and an injured Hicks reach Bishop in the second drop-ship, but Ripley refuses to abandon Newt. She hastily assembles a weapon and rescues Newt from the hive in the processing station, where the two encounter the Alien queen in her egg chamber. Ripley destroys the eggs, enraging the queen, who tears free from her Ovipositor. Pursued by the queen, Ripley and Newt rendezvous with Bishop and Hicks on the drop-ship. All four escape moments before the colony is consumed by the nuclear blast.\n\nOn the Sulaco, Ripley and Bishop's relief at their escape is interrupted when the Alien queen, stowed away on the drop-ship's landing gear, tears Bishop in two. The queen advances on Newt, but Ripley clashes with her using an Exosuit cargo-loader and expels it through an airlock. Ripley, Newt, Hicks and the badly damaged Bishop enter hyper-sleep for the return to Earth."

    "Aliens vs Predator: Requiem": "Following the events of Alien vs. Predator, a Predator ship is leaving Earth carrying Alien face-Huggers, and the body of Scar, the Predator that defeated the Alien Queen. A chest-Burster erupts from Scar's body; it is a new creature that is a hybrid of both species. It quickly matures into an adult Predalien, makes its way onto a scout ship that is then detached from the mothership, and starts killing all the Predators on the ship. A Predator's weapon fire punctures the hull, and the scout ship crashes in the forest outside of Gunnison, Colorado.\n\nWith the Predators dead, the Predalien and several face-Huggers escape, implanting embryos into a nearby father (Kurt Max Runte) and son (Liam James) and several homeless people living in the sewers. An injured Predator sends a distress signal before being killed by the Predalien. The distress signal reaches the Predator home world and a lone Predator, Wolf (Ian Whyte), responds, travels to Earth to track and kill the Aliens. He begins to erase the evidence of the Aliens' presence by destroying the crashed ship and using a blue liquid to dissolve the bodies of the face-Huggers and their victims.\n\nMeanwhile, ex-convict Dallas Howard (Steven Pasquale) has just returned to Gunnison after serving time in prison. He is greeted by Sheriff Eddie Morales (John Ortiz) and reunites with his younger brother Ricky (Johnny Lewis). Ricky has a romantic interest in his classmate Jesse (Kristen Hager) and is constantly harassed by her boyfriend Dale (David Paetkau) and two of his friends. Kelly O'Brien (Reiko Aylesworth) has also just returned to Gunnison after serving in the military and reunites with her husband Tim (Sam Trammell) and daughter Molly (Ariel Gade).\n\nWolf fights a number of Aliens in the sewers, and as the battle reaches the surface several of them disperse into the town. Wolf pursues some to the power plant, where collateral damage from its weapons causes a city-wide power outage. Ricky and Jesse meet at the high school swimming pool but are interrupted by Dale and his cohorts just as the power fails and an Alien enters the building, killing Dale's friends. Another Alien invades the O'Brien home, killing Tim while Kelly escapes with Molly.\n\nKelly, Molly, Ricky, Jesse, Dale, Dallas, and Sheriff Morales meet at a sporting goods store to gather weapons. Troops from the Colorado Army National Guard arrive but are quickly killed by the Aliens. When the battle between Wolf and the Aliens enters the store, Dale is killed and Wolf's shoulder cannons are damaged; he is able to modify one into a hand-held blaster.\n\nAs the survivors attempt to escape Gunnison, they make radio contact with Colonel Stevens (Robert Joy) and learn that an air evacuation is being staged at the center of town. Kelly is suspicious of the military's intentions and convinces a small group to go to the hospital where they hope to escape by helicopter, while Sheriff Morales heads to the evacuation area with the rest of the surviving citizens. The hospital, however, has been invaded and overrun by the Aliens and the Predalien, who has impregnated some pregnant women to breed more Aliens. Wolf soon arrives and in the ensuing battle, Jesse is killed, Ricky is injured by the Predalien, and Dallas takes possession of Wolf's blaster cannon after the Predator is attacked by an Alien and both tumble down an elevator shaft.\n\nAs the battle reaches the rooftop, Dallas, Ricky, Kelly, and Molly escape in the helicopter while Wolf, having survived the fall, battles the Predalien in hand-to-hand combat. Wolf and the Predalien mortally wound each other just as a military jet arrives. Rather than a rescue airlift, it is an F-22 Raptor, executing a tactical nuclear strike with a B83 nuclear bomb that destroys the entire city, killing all the extraterrestrials (including Wolf and the Predalien) along with the remaining citizens. The shock wave causes the fleeing helicopter to crash in a clearing, where the survivors are rescued by the military. Wolf's blaster cannon is confiscated, and Colonel Stevens presents it to Ms. Yutani (Francoise Yip). Ms. Yutani tells Colonel Stevens that the world is not yet ready for this kind of more advance technology. Colonel Stevens replies, \"But this isn't for our world, is it, Ms. Yutani?\""

    "Alien\u00b3": "A fire starts aboard the Colonial Marine spaceship Sulaco. The computer launches an escape pod containing Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), the young girl Newt, the wounded Corporal Hicks, and the damaged android Bishop; all four are in Cryonic stasis. Scans of the crew's Cryotubes show an Alien face-Hugger, a parasite that implants its hosts with Alien embryos, attached to one of the members. The pod crash-lands on Fiorina \"Fury\" 161, a foundry facility and penal colony inhabited by male inmates with histories of physical and sexual violence. After inmates recover the pod and its passengers, a face-Hugger approaches the prison dog.\n\nRipley is awakened by Clemens (Charles Dance), the prison doctor, and informed that she is the only survivor. Many of the ex-inmates, led by Dillon, have embraced an apocalyptic, Millenarian version of Christianity. Ripley is warned by the prison warden, Harold Andrews (Brian Glover), that her presence may have disruptive effects. Ripley requests that Clemens perform an autopsy on Newt (Danielle Edmond), secretly fearing that Newt may be carrying an Alien embryo. Despite protests from the warden and his assistant Aaron, the autopsy is conducted, and no embryo is found. Ripley's unusual behavior begins to frustrate the warden and agitate the prisoners.\n\nA funeral is held for Newt and Hicks and their bodies are cremated in the facility furnace. In another section of the facility, an unusually large Alien bursts from the prison dog. The Alien kills several members of the colony and returns outcast prisoner Golic (Paul McGann) to his deranged state. Ripley re-activates Bishop, who confirms that an Alien came with them to Fiorina in the escape pod. Ripley informs Andrews of her encounters with the Aliens and suggests everyone work together to hunt down and kill it. Andrews does not believe her story but explains that the facility has no weapons; their only hope is the rescue ship being sent for Ripley by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation.\n\nThe Alien surprises Ripley and Clemens in the prison infirmary and kills Clemens. It examines Ripley but spares her and retreats. Andrews orders Aaron (Ralph Brown) to take her back to the infirmary, but he is ambushed and killed by the Alien. Ripley rallies the inmates and proposes they pour flammable toxic waste into the ventilation system and ignite it to flush out the Alien. However, the Alien's intervention causes an explosion, and several inmates are killed. With Aaron's help, Ripley scans herself using the escape pod's medical equipment and discovers the embryo of an Alien Queen growing inside her. She also discovers that Weyland-Yutani hopes to turn the Queen embryo and the adult Alien into biological weapons.\n\nDeducing that the Alien will not kill her because of the embryo she carries, Ripley begs Dillon to kill her; he agrees only if she helps the inmates kill the adult creature first. They form a plan to lure the creature into the foundry's molding facility, trap it via a series of closing doors, and drown it in molten lead. The bait-and-chase plan results in the death of every prisoner except Morse (Danny Webb) and Dillon. Dillon remains in the mold to distract the Alien, allowing it to tear him apart as Morse pours the molten lead onto them. The Alien is covered in molten metal but escapes the mold; Ripley activates the fire sprinklers, causing the Alien's exoskeleton to cool rapidly and shatter, killing it.\n\nThe Weyland-Yutani commando team arrives, including a man who looks identical to Bishop who claims he is Bishop's creator (Lance Henriksen). He tries to persuade Ripley to undergo surgery to remove the Queen embryo, which he claims will be destroyed. Ripley refuses and steps back onto a mobile platform, which Morse positions over the furnace. The Weyland-Yutani team shoot Morse in the leg; Aaron strikes the man with a wrench and is shot dead. The commando team begs Ripley to let them have the \"magnificent specimen\". Ripley throws herself into the furnace. The facility is closed and the only surviving inmate, Morse, is led away."

    "Alita: Battle Angel": "In 2563, planet Earth has survived a war known as \"The Fall.\" There is a city floating above the earth in the sky, called Zalem, suspended by advanced engineering. Beneath this is a city called Iron City. There is a tube from Iron City's Factory connected to Zalem. In the junkyard, Dr. Dyson Ido discovers a core of female cyborg that has brain and core heart, but without body nor limbs. Together with a nurse assistant, Ido rebuilds the cyborg with a spare robotic body in his cyborg clinic. She wakes up with no recollection of any memories. Ido names her \"Alita,\" as she didn't know her own name. He finds out that the new cyborg body integrates well with Alita's original brain as she can control her fingers. Her sensory taste is also proven working when she likes orange fruit when she tried it for the first time.\n\nIt turns out, the name of Ido's deceased daughter was Alita was (referred to as real Alita on-wards). The robotic body was initially built for Ido's late daughter, real Alita because she was wheelchair bound. Real Alita never had a chance to use it as she was killed by a cyber-robber, who broke into Ido's clinic looking for drugs. Ido's partner was Chiren, who is also real Alita's mother. Ido and Chiren separated after the real Alita died. Chiren and Ido came from Zalem and was outcasted to come to Iron City. Chiren's goal after the death of her daughter is to go back to Zalem. Chiren worked for Vector, as he promises to send her back to Zalem. Vector is the boss who manages Iron City Motorball competition. He has the authority from Zalem scientist Nova to send people to Zalem. The winner of Motorball competition gets to be sent up to Zalem by Vector.\n\nAlita befriends a boy named Hugo, who dreams of moving to the sky city of Zalem as well. He also shows her that he wanted to be a Hunter-Warrior like Zapan, a bounty-hunter warrior, with a long sword as his trademark weapon. Hunter-Warrior collects money by killing criminals in Iron City. Hugo also introduces Alita to Motorball race in the neighborhood. Alita tries to participate, falls down and is made fun in the beginning. After a few times, her natural competitive streak shows up, and she is able to defeat everyone to score a Motorball goal.\n\nAlita discovers that Ido is a Hunter-Warrior when she follows him one night and they encounter three deadly cyborgs. When Ido is injured, Alita tried to protect him, and finds out that she is naturally skilled in an ancient martial art called \"Panzer Kunst.\" While in combat, Alita has memory flashbacks of her earlier life on Mars. She used to be a warrior with code '99'. With her skill, she kills two of the cyborgs and severely damaging the third one, called Grewishka, who retreats underground. Grewishka promises to come back and hunt down Alita. Despite Alita's fighting skills, Ido discourages her from becoming a Hunter-Warrior.\n\nOnce Vector and Chiren find out Alita's capability, they get an order from Nova to kill Alita. Nova promises Chiren that she can go back to Zalem if she succeeds the mission. It turns out, Grewishka works for Vector and Chiren. Vector orders Hugo and his friends to attack cyborgs and steal their body parts for fixing and upgrading Grewishka. Vector promises to send Hugo to Zalem once he gets enough credits doing his dirty work (important later). On the next day, Hugo and his friends brought Alita to a forest area outside the city. Here, they found an old abandoned spaceship from \"the Fall\" era. Alita went into the spacecraft through an underwater door and brought back a Berserker warrior cyborg body with her. Ido refuses to install her in the body, as he wants Alita to have a second chance in life without being a warrior. Alita is disappointed and rebels by registering herself as a Hunter-Warrior.\n\nAlita and Hugo go to the Kansas Bar to ask other Hunter-Warriors to help her take down Grewishka. They refuse to help as Grewishka is not in the wanted list, and there is no benefit / bounty in killing him. Zapan tries to intimidate and embarrass Alita, but Alita easily beat him in a fight and being humiliated in the process. Afterward, Alita challenges all the other Hunter-Warriors and creates a massive battle in the bar. Ido comes in time to stop the fight, as an upgraded Grewishka storms into the bar and challenges Alita to a rematch. Despite her courage and martial arts skills, Alita's body is sliced up by Grewishka's bladed fingers before Ido and another Hunter-Warrior force him to retreat again. Without any other options, Ido places Alita in the Berserker body, which automatically integrates with her.\n\nVector realizes that he is not able to defeat Alita easily. He arranges for a Motorball match where all the participants are instructed to kill Alita for a significant amount of credit. At the same time, he urges Hugo to enter Alita in the Motorball competition. When Alita wins, both Hugo and Alita can go to Zalem.\n\nWith her new body, Alita has higher power and enhanced flexibility. She enters her name in a Motorball tryout race, as per Hugo's request. Ido discovers that the other contestants are Hunter-Warriors and other cyborgs hired by Vector to kill her. Meanwhile, Zapan is plotting his revenge against Hugo and Alita. Zapan caught Hugo and his friend Tanji while they are stealing cyborg parts. Zapan kills Tanji and frames Hugo for murdering the cyborg they were taking parts from.\n\nNow Hugo has a bounty on his head, and all Hunter-Warriors are looking for him. While Alita is in Motorball race, Hugo is trying to escape from Zapan. Hugo calls Alita and tells her to meet him at the abandoned church. After Alita eliminates the other contestants, she heads to the church to confront Zapan and learn the truth about Hugo's work before Zapan mortally wounds him. Chiren was at the church, supposed to kill Alita, but instead, she saves Hugo's life by having him decapitated and uses Alita's heart to keep his brain alive. This angers Zapan, but Alita grabs his Damascus Blade sword and slices off his face.\n\nHugo's head is transplanted onto a cyborg body by Ido. He also tells Alita that Hugo's belief of going to Zalem for one million credits was a lie fabricated by Vector, as citizens of Iron City will never be able to enter Zalem. Alita storms through the Factory to confront Vector. Vector reveals that Chiren has been murdered and her organs and body parts will be sent to Zalem. This is the only way citizens of Iron City gets to go to Zalem.\n\nAlita once again battles Grewishka in Vector's office and kills him before stabbing Vector, who has been mentally controlled by Zalem scientist Nova. Alita promises Nova to get revenge for Hugo, and he made the mistake of underestimating her. In the meantime, Hugo has run away from the clinic. With his new cyborg body, he attempts to climb a Factory tube towards Zalem. Alita pleads with Hugo to return with her, as a massive spiked ring sent by Nova comes hurtling down the tube, shredding Hugo's body. Alita manages to grab Hugo's remaining arm and use her sword to secure hold onto the tube. Hugo's elbow joints cannot support him and break apart, but not before he can say goodbye, leaving Alita on the tube clutching the remaining of his arm. Alita is devastated but determined to live on Hugo's memory.\n\nIn the final scene, Alita is shown as the star athlete of the Motorball tournament. The crowd cheers for her as she points her sword towards Zalem while Nova watches her from above."

    "All Is Lost": "Somewhere in the Indian Ocean (\"1700 nautical miles from the Sumatra Straits\"), we see an abstract image of an object floating in water. Our Man (Robert Redford) narrates:\n\n\"13th of July, 4:50 p.m. I'm sorry. I know that means little at this point, but I am. I tried. I think you would all agree that I tried. To be true, to be strong, to be kind, to love, to be right, but I wasn't.\" And I know you knew this, in each of your ways. And I am sorry. All is lost here, except for soul and body, that is what's left of it, and a half day's ration. It's inexcusable, I know that now. How it could have taken this long to admit that, I'm not sure, but it did. I fought to the end. I'm not sure what that is worth, but know that I did. I've always hoped for more for you all. I will miss you. I'm sorry.\"\n\nThe film cuts to eight days earlier, as Our Man wakes up to find his sailboat, the Virginia Jean, a Cal 39, taking on water. He goes out on deck to see the boat has hit a detached shipping container filled with sneakers, leaving a yard-long hole in his high starboard side. He goes below to get a sea anchor and ties it to the container. The anchor pulls the container free from the sailboat. He steers the boat back to the side of the container and jumps onto the container to go retrieve his sea anchor. He then steers his boat away from the container for good.\n\nOur Man checks the electronics on the boat and discovers that they do not work. He retrieves a box filled with fiber glass patch materials and mixes up a batch and starts patching the hole. He uses a knife to carve a piece of wood until it can fit in the manual- hand-bilge pump hole, as he has lost the lever for it. He starts pumping out the water from below deck. That night he sleeps in a hammock, above the water remaining in the boat.\n\nThe next day he continues patching the hole in the side of the boat and pumping more water. It's slow, exhausting work. He pulls out the radio equipment and pours bottled water on the interior of the devices to remove conductive sea salt from them. He sets them out to dry on deck.\n\nThe next day, he's able to complete cleaning the cabin with a sponge and mop. His fiber glass patch seems tentative, but at least keeps water out. He drags one of the boat's service battery on deck and hooks it to his radio. The radio does not work. He consults his navigation charts. He goes below and as he's looking through a book on celestial navigation, he hears someone speaking on the radio. He hurries back up on deck and makes an SOS call. It doesn't appear to work before the radio goes dead.\n\nLater, he has a couple of stiff drinks and begins fixing a meal. It begins to rain. He goes out on deck and enjoys washing off in a brief rain. He eats a pasta dinner, reads some of a book using a head lamp, and goes to sleep.\n\nThe next day he hoists himself high up the mast in a bosun's chair, and discovers a disconnected antenna lead. He reattaches the lead but, while at the top of the mast, sees an oncoming tropical storm. He immediately descends to make preparations for it. He packs things away and even takes time to shave.\n\nWhen the storm arrives, he runs before the wind under bare poles for a while, until he determines that approach is too tiresome and dangerous. He returns below deck to put on a rain suit. He intends to bring the boat into a hove-to position and puts on a safety harness and starts crawling to the bow to hoist the storm jib. Suddenly, a large wave hits him and he is thrown overboard. He manages to hang on and pull himself back on board, returning to the cabin where he vomits sea water and briefly collapses.\n\nThe boat starts to list heavily, then capsizes, rolling completely over. He goes back out on deck and throws the sea anchor out. The boat does another 180 degree roll, knocking him overboard. He makes his way along the mast and gets back on deck just before the boat returns upright. The main mast has snapped and most of the equipment on board is destroyed.\n\nHe cuts the mast loose, then goes back into the cabin and sees that the fiberglass patch has started leaking again. The boat lurches and he strikes his forehead on the bulkhead and falls unconscious. When he wakes, the cabin has about two feet of water in it, with more gushing in.\n\nHe grabs the bag containing a life raft and takes it out on deck. After tying the raft to the railing of the sailboat, he tosses it overboard and pulls the rip cord, causing the raft to self inflate. He pulls it close to the boat and jumps on board. He pulls the roof of the raft up and around and zips it closed. He rides out the rest of the storm in darkness.\n\nThe next day he awakens in the raft, which is tethered to the boat that is now is half-submerged. He pulls on the rope and brings the raft up next to the boat. He climbs onto the boat and looks things over. He lowers himself into the flooded cabin and gathers some canned food, fresh water and a few other items. He is leaving, but remembers something else he wants and pulls the raft back to the boat and goes back into the cabin, diving under the water and retrieving a white cardboard box. He then starts tending the wound to his forehead, until he realizes that the boat is going under. He returns to the raft and watches the Virginia Jean sink.\n\nHe opens the white cardboard box, which contains a sextant and a card. He tosses the card aside without reading it. He then refers to an instructional manual and tries using the sextant and navigational maps to determine where he is.\n\nHe wakes after sleeping to find sea water has seeped into his raft. He starts using a rag to mop it up and wring it out over the side.\n\nHe figures his best hope of being found is to make his way over to the shipping lanes. From his readings, he is heading north by northwest, toward a shipping zone he sees on the map. Another storm moves in. The storm capsizes his raft. He unzips the cover and goes out to pull the raft back upright. Back inside, surrounded by wind, rain, and water, he closes his eyes and covers his ears.\n\nThe next day he uses a hand pump to re-inflate the raft and continues bailing water out of the raft. He finds that his jug of drinking water has been contaminated by seawater, after which he gets emotional and emits a drawn out, \"Fuuuccck!\" He has a thought and cuts open the water jug and uses a plastic bag to make a freshwater still.\n\nOur Man is exposed to the elements, becoming dehydrated and numb. His still works and he gets a little water to drink, savoring it. He maps out that he is in the shipping lane now and he begins looking intently along the horizon. Seeing nothing, he naps. When he wakes, he sees a cargo ship and lights a flare, waving his arms and yelling for help, as the ship passes by very close. It keeps on moving and disappears.\n\nThe next day, he finally gets a tug on his fishing line, but just as he is about to pull in a fish, a small shark grabs it at the surface. Many sharks are swimming under his raft. That night, he wakes up to find another cargo ship passing closely by, almost right on top of him. This time he fires off two aerial flares, but again, the ship keeps going and disappears.\n\nOn the eighth day, he charts that he has now moved north out of the shipping lane and back to open ocean. He is also out of food and has very little water and cannot hope to survive much longer. He writes the message that he narrated at the beginning of the movie, puts it in a jar, and with some hesitation, he tosses it into the water.\n\nThat night, he sees a light in the distance, possibly another ship. He is out of signaling devices, but tears blank pages from his journal and a book to create a signal fire in the empty water jug. As he adds more paper to the fire, he loses control of it and the flames consume his raft. He falls overboard. Treading water, he looks up to the heavens, then stops swimming and lets himself sink, watching the raft burning on the surface above him.\n\nAs he sinks, he sees the hull of a boat with a search light approaching his burning raft. Our man swims up to the surface, and a hand reaches down to him."

    "All Quiet on the Western Front": "In Spring 1917, three years into the First World War, 17-year-old Paul B\u00e4umer enlists in the Imperial German Army alongside his school friends, Albert Kropp, Franz M\u00fcller, and Ludwig Behm. They listen to a patriotic speech by a school official and unknowingly receive uniforms from soldiers killed in a previous battle. After they are deployed in Northern France near La Malmaison, they are befriended by Stanislaus \"Kat\" Katczinsky, an older soldier. Their romantic view of the war is shattered by the realities of trench warfare on the Western Front, and Ludwig is killed by artillery on the first night.\n\nOn November 7, 1918, German official Matthias Erzberger, weary of mounting losses, meets with German High Command to persuade them to begin armistice talks with the Allied powers. Meanwhile, Paul and Kat steal a goose from a farm to share with Albert, Franz, and another veteran, Tjaden Stackfleet, with whom they have grown close behind the front in Champagne. Kat, who is illiterate, gets Paul to read him a letter from his wife and worries that he cannot reintegrate into peacetime society. Franz spends the night with a French woman and brings back her scarf as a souvenir.\n\nOn the morning of November 9, General Friedrichs drives Erzberger and the German delegation to a train bound for the Forest of Compi\u00e8gne to negotiate a ceasefire. Paul and his friends go on a mission to find 60 missing recruits sent to reinforce their unit and discover that they were killed by gas after taking off their masks too soon. Friedrichs, who opposes the talks, orders an attack before French reinforcements arrive. That night, Erzberger's delegation reaches the Forest of Compi\u00e8gne, and Paul's regiment is sent to the front to prepare to attack the French lines.\n\nOn the morning of November 10, Ferdinand Foch, the Supreme Allied Commander, gives 72 hours for the Germans to accept the Allied terms, with no room for negotiation. Meanwhile, the German attack takes the French front line after hand-to-hand fighting but is routed by a combined arms counterattack with Saint-Chamond tanks, airplanes, and flamethrowers. Franz is separated from the group, and Albert is killed trying to surrender. Trapped in a crater in no man's land with a French soldier, Paul stabs him and watches him die slowly, becoming remorseful and asking forgiveness to his dead body. Erzberger learns of Kaiser Wilhelm II's abdication and receives instructions in the evening from field marshal Paul von Hindenburg to accept the Allied terms. Paul returns to his unit and sees them celebrating the imminent end of the war. He finds a wounded Tjaden, who gives him Franz's scarf. Paul and Kat bring him food but Tjaden, distraught at being crippled, kills himself.\n\nAround 5:00 AM on November 11, Erzberger's delegation signs the armistice set to take effect at 11 AM. After learning of the ceasefire, Paul and Kat steal from the farm one last time, but Kat is shot by the farmer's young son and dies as Paul carries him to the hospital. Friedrichs wants to end the war with a German victory and orders an attack to start at 10:45. A despondent, battle-hardened Paul kills many French soldiers before being speared through the chest by a bayonet seconds before 11:00 when the fighting stops, and the front falls silent. A short time later, a newly arrived German recruit that Paul had saved in the combat finds Paul's mud-caked body and retrieves Franz's scarf that was passed on to Paul from Tjaden."

    "All Star Superman": "Dr. Leo Quintum and his P.R.O.J.E.C.T. Team are exploring the Sun when they are sabotaged by a booby-trapped, genetically enhanced Lex Luthor clone. Superman saves the day, but it turns out that his body has been overdosed with solar radiation that not only gives him new powers but now is slowly killing him. Luthor, having orchestrated the death of Superman while under the employment of General Sam Lane, is arrested thanks to Clark Kent's article and sentenced to death. Deciding to keep his impending death a secret from the public, Superman reveals his secret identity to Lois Lane because he wants to spend his remaining time with her. Though Lois was unable to accept it after years of him keeping the truth of his identity as Clark Kent from her, Superman takes her to the Fortress of Solitude. During this visit, Superman's secretive behavior and indirect exposure to alien chemicals heightens Lois's paranoia to the point of attacking Superman with a kryptonite laser. However, seeing the solar radiation has now made him immune to green kryptonite, Superman is able to calm her down and reveals that his secret was that he has been preparing her birthday present: superpowers for 24 hours. Now as a Superwoman, she and Superman stop an attack by Subterraneans in Metropolis just as Samson and Atlas arrive. Flirting with Lois, and showing a newspaper that reads \"Superman Dead, by Clark Kent\", Samson is revealed to be the one who stole jewels from an Ultra-Sphinx that he gave to Lois. Answering the Ultra-Sphinx's unanswerable question to save Lois, Superman then defeats Atlas and Samson in a double arm-wrestling match before spending the rest of the day with Lois as her powers fade. Later, Kent meets Luthor for an exclusive interview at Stryker's Island. However, Superman's energy causes the Parasite to free himself and causes havoc in the prison. Clark stops him while not revealing his secret identity, with Luthor disclosing his respect for Clark as both a journalist and a regular person. He then reveals a tunnel from his cell for Clark to escape with the help of Nasthalthia, his delinquent niece. Though Clark asked, Luthor states that he has no desire to escape as long as Superman dies before he does. Two months later, after taking the city of Kandor to a new planet to thrive, Superman finds Metropolis has been repaired with Kryptonian architecture, and Earth has been protected by Bar-El and Lilo, Krypton's first astronauts, survivors, and Superman's relatives. But, to his dismay, the two have less altruistic goals and intend to turn Earth into a new Krypton. However, Bar-El and Lilo begin showing signs of illness: the two had passed through the remnants of Krypton and thus were saturated with kryptonite. To save them, Superman places the two within the Phantom Zone at their request until a cure can be found. After settling his affairs in order, Superman proceeds to finish his last will and testament. By then, having reprogrammed one of Superman's robots to get the formula he used to give Lois super powers, Luthor succeeds in making a super serum for himself and tricks the executioners in having him drink it. Escaping, he meets up with Nasthalthia below one of his lairs to continue his plans. Superman finishes off his final entry in the Fortress of Solitude when he learns of Luthor's secret ally: Solaris, the tyrant star computer, which betrayed Luthor by tampering with Earth's sun and turned it blue. With his robots, Superman engages Solaris in space. All seems lost until Superman's pet Sun-Eater sacrifices itself to weaken the tyrant star, which allows Superman to destroy Solaris. Clark returns to the Daily Planet, very ill, to submit his article until he falls dead. As the staff tries to save him, the super-powered Luthor arrives and attempts to kill Lois when Clark comes to and fights off Luthor with a gravity gun. Though the gun is destroyed and he is powerless against Luthor, Superman actually intended the weapon to warp time for Luthor so that his powers burn out early. As his powers fade, Luthor briefly sees the world as Superman sees it, and weeps as he gains a measure of understanding of the universe and everyone in it before realizing his spare serum was taken by Superman who destroyed it. With Superman's body starting to turn into pure energy, he and Lois embrace one final time and he proclaims his love for her once and for all. He takes off, flying into the Sun as his solar-radio consciousness begins to overtake his body as he enters the Sun and thus saves the day for the last time. One year later, a memorial service is held for Superman. Only Lois does not attend, believing Superman is not dead and will return after he is done fixing the sun. Quintum visits Luthor in his death row cell. Now enlightened from his ordeal and accepting his impending death, Luthor presents Quintum with the only thing that could redeem him for his actions over the years, a formula to recreate Superman's genetic structure through a healthy human embryo. Inside the sun, Superman, now a solar being, is activating and making machinery within."

    "All the Old Knives": "In early 2020, CIA officer Henry Pelham is informed by his boss, Vick Wallinger, that the CIA has reopened the case of Turkish Alliance 127, a 2012 terrorist hijacking which ended in tragedy. Headquarters suspects there was a leak from the Vienna station, where Henry and Vick work. Henry is sent to interview Celia Harrison, who also worked at the Vienna station at the time of the hijacking. Henry and Celia were lovers, but she left him shortly after the event.\n\nCelia, now retired, lives in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California with her family. Henry meets her at an upscale restaurant, which is almost empty of customers and staff. As Henry and Celia talk, she reveals that an Austrian intelligence agent named Karl Stein approached her shortly after she moved to Carmel. He wanted her to inform on her coworkers, but she refused. Henry has Celia recall the events of the hijacking.\n\nIn a flashback to 2012, Flight 127 is on the runway when it is hijacked by four armed militants belonging to an Islamic terrorist group. The Vienna station jumps into action to address the crisis and learns that Ilyas Shushani, a Chechen and former informant for Henry, may be involved. The hijackers threaten to kill the passengers unless several of their comrades are released from custody. Ahmed, a CIA courier who happened to be on the plane, contacts the CIA and suggests an attack via the plane's undercarriage. Celia connects with a possible source named Mohammed, but the meeting seems to yield nothing of value. Henry tells Celia and her mentor, Bill Compton, that when Henry worked in Moscow his superiors forced him to betray Ilyas to the Russian government as a trade-off for intel on an imminent attack on a U.S. embassy.\n\nThe Vienna station receives another message from Ahmed saying that the terrorists have a camera mounted on the plane's undercarriage and the assault should be called off. Celia notices differences in the language of Ahmed's messages and fears he has been compromised. Checking the station's phone logs, she notices that a call to Iran was placed from Bill's office phone. Then Ahmed is killed and thrown off the plane. The next day, Celia leaves both Henry and Vienna.\n\nIn the present, Henry asks why she ended their relationship so abruptly. Celia reveals that she saw a call on Henry's cellphone from the same Iranian number that she had found in the station phone logs. It is revealed that when the terrorists' demands were not met, they released sarin gas, killing themselves, the crew, and all passengers. The Vienna station is devastated by the outcome. Realizing that Henry was the leak, she left him but did not divulge her discovery to the CIA.\n\nShe further confesses that, after Henry contacted her to arrange this meeting, she contacted Karl Stein, and he arranged the meeting place, the staff, and fake customers, with the aim of poisoning Henry via his wine.\n\nAs Henry begins to succumb to the poison, Celia tearfully asks why he betrayed everyone to the terrorists. He explains that he was lured into a meeting with Ilyas, who had become radicalized and masterminded the hijacking. Ilyas' people staged the meeting between Mohammed and Celia to create the impression that Celia's life was in danger. This pushed Henry into revealing the plan for an undercarriage assault, and then the presence of Ahmed on the plane, in exchange for her life.\n\nHenry comes to terms with his impending death, and Celia returns home to her husband and children. Karl calls Vick to report that Henry has died, revealing that they had been working together the entire time. (thanks to Wikipedia)"

    "Allegiant": "Picking up shortly after the previous film, 'Insurgent' left off, now that Jeanine is dead, Evelyn (Naomi Watts) has assumed control of Chicago and is placing everyone in Erudite that worked for Jeanine on trial, while also sealing off the gates to the rediscovered land outside the city.\n\nTris (Shailene Woodley) and Four (Theo James) watch as Max (Mekhi Pfeiffer) is the first to go on trial. Most of Evelyn's followers demand that Max be executed, while those that follow Johanna (Octavia Spencer) think he ought to be spared. Kang (Daniel Dae Kim) gives Max the Candor truth serum. Max shows no remorse for killing people under Jeanine's orders, and he compares people to sheep that get slaughtered if they stray from their shepherd. Evelyn listens to the people and has Edgar (Jonny Weston) shoot Max in the head. Caleb (Ansel Elgort) is on trial next, and he fears for what they'll do to him. Johanna is booed out with her followers for disagreeing with Evelyn's verdict.\n\nFour goes against his mother, saying there was no point in going to war with Jeanine when Evelyn just became her.\n\nTris and Four plot to break Caleb out. Four orders Evelyn's guards to release Caleb to him. Four takes him outside and throws him into a ditch before taking out his gun and pretending to shoot Caleb. The guards leave, and Caleb comes out of hiding.\n\nThe three of them, along with Christina (Zoe Kravitz) and Tori (Maggie Q) plot to break out of the city. Peter (Miles Teller) comes along so that he won't rat on the group. After fooling Evelyn's guards, the group heads toward the wall, but one of the guards alerts Edgar to their plan.\n\nAs the group reaches the wall, they shoot their grappling hooks and use the wires to scale the wall. However, the fence on top of the wall is electrified. Tris goes down the wall with Four following so she can destroy the electrical box. Edgar and his boys show up and start shooting at the group. Four holds them off as Tris places a bomb on the box. As they run back to the wall, she detonates it, blowing up the box and killing some of the goons. Tris and Four run back up the wall. Tori is shot and killed by Edgar, and Tris is forced to leave her behind.\n\nOnce they make it further away from the city, they discover that the land has been mostly burnt out and become a toxic wasteland. The rain that falls on them is red. A van rolls in above the group... it's Edgar. They run for it and reach a point where a wall to another city appears to open up, revealing vans and aircraft. A squad of soldiers take the group in and blast Edgar's van away.\n\nThe group is taken in plasma bubbles to a facility known as the Bureau of Genetic Welfare. They are decontaminated and have a bar code printed onto their skin, but all with different coding. A video shows the group an explanation of what happened to the world. Many generations ago, a hopeful miracle drug was created, but it naturally spun out of control and led to chaos around the globe, leading the survivors to form the Bureau and strive to fix things.\n\nTris is taken to meet the Bureau's director David (Jeff Daniels). He considers Tris a miracle, as she is what the Bureau considers \"pure\", while the others, like Caleb and Four, are \"damaged.\" David has also been watching everything that goes on around the city, which explains how he knows Tris and what she's been through, as well as everything that is happening in the city now. David gives Tris a device that allows her to see the memories of her late mother Natalie (Ashley Judd) from when she was a child living in The Fringe, the isolated area where the infected roam and attack survivors. Natalie was saved and later worked with David to establish the Faction system.\n\nFour is assigned to a woman named Nita (Nadia Hilker), who teaches him how to use target drones for combat. Peter and Caleb are put on surveillance duty to observe what goes on around the city.\n\nCaleb observes Evelyn and her henchmen meeting with Johanna and a few of her followers, which have called themselves the Allegiant. The two leaders are prepared for a war, which is instigated by Edgar after he shoots one of Johanna's followers.\n\nFour is on duty with the other men on his team. They go into The Fringe and accidentally kill the father of a young boy. The boy and other survivors are brought in and supposedly decontaminated with a special gas. However, Christina notes to Four that the boy has forgotten his father and his own name.\n\nDavid takes Tris to Providence, a clean and dystopic city structure where all the privileged folks live. Tris appears before a council to go along with David's plan to cleanse the world, but she rejects the notion that they should classify some as pure and others as damaged.\n\nFour is apparently sent to The Fringe with one Bureau worker, Matthew (Bill Skarsgard). However, Matthew tips Four off about the Bureau's true intentions. He fights the goons on board and crashes the ship. Four escapes and tells Matthew to tell Tris and David that Four left him behind, because Tris will know that's a lie. Four is eventually captured and taken back into the city.\n\nDavid sends Peter back into the city to deliver the gas to Evelyn, claiming that David is a personal friend. Peter suggests using it on the Allegiant so that Evelyn may retain control over everyone. She tests it out on her ex-husband Marcus (Ray Stevenson). With a heavy dose, Marcus literally watches his mind deteriorate and his memories disappear, leaving him with no idea who Evelyn is or was to him.\n\nKnowing that something bad is gonna happen, Tris steals David's hovercraft and gets Caleb and Christina to head back into the city. Nita gives them some weapons because she hates David too. The three fly away and are pursued by David's henchmen. They try to bring Tris down gently, but she attempts to manually fly the ship, nearly crashing it until they are able to go beyond the camouflage wall.\n\nTris and Christina make it into Evelyn's facility where she plans to release the gas unto the Allegiant, unaware that it will go throughout the entire city. Tris reunites with Four while Caleb is outside on surveillance. Evelyn begins to release the gas until Four tells her that it will affect both of them, and he won't know who his mother is. She has a change of heart and tries to stop it, but Peter shoots her in the back and allows it to continue, until the gas reaches the room he's in. He frantically tries to stop it but can't.\n\nThe gas starts spreading into the city, hitting some of the Allegiant. Tris runs down to the main control room, but David, who is still watching, tries to hold her off. Tris uses the drones to find the main power grid for the gas and blasts through the wall to ultimately destroy it. David yells in defeat while the gas stops spreading.\n\nTris sends a message to everyone in the city, saying that they are neither pure nor damaged, but that they must stand united as one city against their oppressors. Tris leans against Four, thinking everything is fine... not knowing David is still watching and planning something sinister."

    "Allied": "French Morocco, 1940\n\nMax Vatan (Brad Pitt) parachutes into the desert. He walks some distance before he is met by a driver who supplies him with luggage, a wedding ring, a weapon, and false documents. The driver tells Max that the woman he is to meet will be wearing a purple dress, and to \"look for the hummingbird.\"\n\nMax arrives at a club in Casablanca. He finds the woman, Marianne Beausejour (Marion Cotillard). She instantly knows who he is and excitedly greets him with a kiss. They pose as husband and wife to Marianne's friends before they leave. As they drive away, Marianne compliments Max on making a convincing appearance, but she criticizes his Parisian French accent.\n\nMax and Marianne's mission is to kill the Nazi ambassador. They work on their ruse posing as a married couple by living together and trying to make their charade convincing.\n\nThe two meet with the ambassador, Hobar (August Diehl). Marianne does most of the talking as she tries to convince Hobar that Max is her French assistant. Hobar insists Max attend a party, but Max pretends he would rather play poker. Hobart challenges him to split a deck of cards. If he gets the low card, he must come to the party. Max expertly shuffles the deck and picks the low card, the outcome he desired.\n\nThey continue preparing for their operation, including target practice, and pretend to be husband and wife. Max resists Marianne's sincere advances for a while until they have sex in Max's car in the middle of a sandstorm.\n\nThe two attend the party with multiple Nazi officials present. When Hobar descends the stairs and speaks to the assembled guests, there is a large explosion outside. Max and Marianne seize weapons from under a table and shoot the Germans. Max wounds Hobar and then finishes him off with an expert shot to the head. Marianne kills one German when he tries to shoot her, and she nearly kills his wife until Max pulls her away. They continue shooting until they drive away.\n\nWith the mission completed, Max and Marianne prepare to part ways, but he invites her to join him in London where they can get married. She agrees to join him and they wed.\n\nAn air raid takes place over London. Marianne is in labor and is evacuated from the hospital as bombs start dropping. Max stands by her side, and Marianne gives birth in the hospital courtyard to a baby girl that they name Anna.\n\nAfter a year, Max and Marianne have grown accustomed to their life as a family. They have truly fallen in love. Max is called in to meet with a commanding officer, Frank Heslop (Jared Harris), as well as an S.O.E. official (Simon McBurney). They inform Max that Marianne is suspected of being a German spy. The real Marianne Beausejour had been killef, and that a German spy (Max's wife) took the dead woman's identity. Max learns that Hobar was a dissident and Hitler had wanted him dead. The officer orders Max to conduct a test of Marianne's loyalty, a Blue Dye operation, or both of them will be shot. Max is infuriated that they question his wife's loyalty, but agrees to cooperate, until he decides to investigate the truth on his own.\n\nMax plans to hold a party for Frank and other officers to help them see that Marianne is who she says she is. Max goes to his sister Bridget's (Lizzy Caplan) home to invite her and her girlfriend Louise (Charlotte Hope).\n\nMax visits an former associate of Marianne's named Guy Sangster (Matthew Goode). Max finds Guy in an hospital recuperating from injuries, confined to a wheelchair, and his face horribly disfigured from his wounds. Max tries to show Guy a photo of Marianne on their wedding day so he can identify her, but Guy's right eye was shot off, and the retina in his left eye is dislodged, so he can only see a white figure. He screams at Max for what has happened to him, but also tells him of another man in France, Paul Delamare, who knew Marianne. Frank orders one of his pilots flying a clandestine mission to supply Resistance fighters in France to find Paul, a one -armed man, and confirm Marianne's identity. While waiting for the answer, he is delayed and killed by Germans.\n\nThe party goes on at Max and Marianne's home. Numerous guests are in attendance, with several of them getting intimate in various corners around the house. During the party, an air raid occurs. A German plane is shot down and appears to be going to crash into their apartment. Max runs upstairs to get Anna, but Marianne already has her. He protects them as the plane narrowly misses and crashes in a field behind their house.\n\nMax flies into France and looks for Paul Delamare (Thierry Fremont). Resistance members tell him Paul is in jail. They sneak into town and go to the Gendarme's office so Max can talk to Paul, the former associate of Marianne's. The soldiers take the Gendarme's keys at gunpoint and enters Paul's cell. He is very drunk and he pukes when Max wakes him up. Paul tries to go for his flask, but Max takes it away until Paul answers his questions. He shows Paul the picture of Marianne and asks if he knows who she is. Paul's answers seem to confirm her identity until he mentions that when he saw her, she played the French Marseilles on the piano like a goddess right in front of the Germans. Max is stunned. The Gendarme alerts German troops seeking black market cigarettes to the presence of the Resistance soldiers. Max and his comrades shoot the Germans, and Max tosses a grenade into their personnel carrier before administering a coup de gr\u00e2ce to the wounded Germans.\n\nMax returns to England and demands that Marianne go with him. He takes her to an pub where he tells her to play the piano and the French song Marseilles that Paul had mentioned. After hesitating, Marianne closes the piano, as she knows the story. She starts crying as she didn't think the Germans would find her in England. But they did and threatened to harm Anna if Marianne didn't spy for them. She admits she sent the message last night and she has been forced to spy for the Germans. Max is furious, but he asks her if she really loved him. Marianne says that she does love him and the life they have together.\n\nMax plans to take Marianne and Anna away. He kills the nanny and a jeweler who were her handlers. They go to an airfield where Max tries to get a plane started, but Frank and other soldiers arrive. Frank confronts Max and is preparing to take him in for treason. Marianne gently sets Anna down in the backseat and takes a gun from the glove compartment. She gets out of the car and tells Max she loves him and to take care of Anna. She turns her back and shoots herself in the head. Max takes his jacket off and covers Marianne's body. Frank orders the other soldiers to report that Max killed Marianne by his own hand.\n\nIn the final scene, Marianne writes a letter for Anna to read when she is older. She writes how she loved her, Max, and the year they had together in London. The last thing we see as Marianne's voice-over finishes is an older Max and teen-aged Anna walking through the field of their ranch."

    "Aloha, Bobby and Rose": "At a pool hall in Los Angeles, California, Bobby Eckert (Paul Le Mat) loses money in a billiards game. Unable to pay his thuggish opponent, Bobby offers the title to his car as collateral and promises to return the following night with the money. Bobby leaves with his friend and co-worker, Moxey (Robert Carradine), and the two cruise around until dawn.\n\nThe next day, as Bobby reports to his job at an auto repair shop, his boss, Benny (Mario Gallo), reprimands him for his incessant tardiness. Moxey says that he has made it into transmission school, meaning he will soon earn a higher wage. Learning that Moxey must wake up at 6:00 a.m. to attend the school, Bobby says he would prefer to make less money and sleep late.\n\nLater that afternoon, Bobby delivers a car to Rose Miller (Dianne Hull), a waitress at a fast food restaurant. He asks for a ride home, but Rose refuses, saying that someone from the shop drove her to work in a dirty tow truck and she got a ketchup stain on her pants as a result. Bobby goes to a bus stop across the street, but Rose takes pity on him when it starts to rain and offers him a ride.\n\nThey stop at Rose's house, where Bobby meets Rose's young son, Eric, and her mother. Rose invites Bobby to come ice-skating with her, and he becomes smitten while watching her skate. They go to Pink's hot dog stand for dinner, and after cruising around, they park and look at photographs in Rose's wallet. Bobby asks where Rose's father is, and she explains that he never returned from the Korean War. When Bobby sees a picture of Rose dressed like a pizza, she tells him about the time she went on the television game show, Let's Make a Deal, and won a trip to Hawaii. However, she decided to trade the trip for a mystery prize behind a curtain, which turned out to be a tricycle. They kiss, and Bobby suggests sex in the back of the car. Saddened, Rose says she is not interested in having a one-night stand. Bobby, apologizing that he does not take himself seriously, confesses that he owes someone money at the pool hall. Rose agrees to accompany him to the pool hall, then whimsically begs him to take her to Hawaii.\n\nStopping by a liquor store on the way to the pool hall, Bobby entertains Rose by pretending to rob a young cashier with a piece of beef jerky. The cashier's elderly father emerges from a back room wielding a rifle and orders Bobby to freeze, believing that Bobby is the same man who robbed him the previous week. The man cocks his gun, but Rose knocks him over the head with a bottle. Falling to the ground, the man accidentally shoots his son. Terrified, Rose screams and Bobby ushers her outside, past the boy's dead body.\n\nFleeing in her car, Rose pleads with Bobby to turn around and explain the situation to the police, but he refuses. Taking a corner too quickly, the car rolls onto its side, causing Rose and Bobby to hit their heads on the windshield. Dazed, Bobby helps Rose out of the upturned vehicle and they run, narrowly avoiding police.\n\nThey retrieve Bobby's car and stop at a fast food restaurant, where one of the customers notices Bobby's bloody forehead and alerts a police officer. The officer and his partner approach Bobby in the parking lot, but he convinces them that the blood is from a motorcycle mishap earlier that evening.\n\nLater, the couple stops at a secluded spot and Rose notices Bobby's wound is bleeding more. Bobby apologizes for not knowing what to do, and Rose says that she cannot leave her child, no matter what.\n\nThe next morning, Bobby takes Rose to a bus station by the beach and apologizes that he cannot return to Los Angeles with her, saying he may go to San Diego or even further south to Mexico. Rose cries as she boards the bus back into town, and Bobby remarks that they might see each other in Hawaii someday. Although Rose takes a seat by the window, she cannot bear to part ways and rushes out before the bus leaves.\n\nLater, at a parking lot near San Diego, Bobby fights with a man who sits on his car. The man's friends team up against Bobby, but a stranger named Buford Wizell (Tim McIntire) threatens them with a gun, then offers to buy Bobby and Rose a drink, insisting they join him and his girlfriend, Donna Sue (Leigh French). Although Rose resists the idea, she agrees when Buford also offers to buy dinner.\n\nIn Buford's car, the two couples ride to Tijuana, Mexico, where Buford says that he once played for the Dallas Cowboys football team but was fired after a disagreement with the coach. Later, at a local restaurant, Rose is bored by Buford's ramblings. She cries while fixing her makeup in a bathroom, and Donna Sue comforts her, guessing that Rose and Bobby are having a fight. As they leave a bar, Buford urinates into someone's car and drunkenly admits to Bobby that he was fired from the Cowboys on his first day.\n\nReturning back across the border and to the town where they met, Buford offers Bobby his hotel room for the night, saying that he and Donna Sue are going to head back to Texas. Once they are alone, Rose cries and tells Bobby she misses her son.\n\nThe following day, Bobby calls Buford from a payphone, and Buford promises him a business opportunity in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nAt a Los Angeles playground, Rose meets her mother, and says that she must go away with her son, Eric.\n\nIn Studio City, Bobby stops to buy Eric an ice cream cone, and Rose follows him, leaving the boy alone in the car. A police officer discovers the abandoned child and coaxes him out. More police arrive, and as Bobby and Rose leave the ice cream shop, they spot the police with Eric and hurry away in the other direction. Bobby instructs Rose to call her mother from a payphone and arranges to reunite with her at a hotel that evening. When her mother does not answer the phone, Rose calls police and provides information about the liquor store shooting that she and Bobby witnessed.\n\nThat night, after arranging with a friend to meet him at the hotel, Bobby sees the friend arrive and walks outside. However, police have surrounded the building, and, believing that he has a gun, shoot Bobby down before he has a chance to surrender. Having witnessed the shooting, Rose cries over Bobby's dead body."

    "Alone in the Dark": "The narrator reads a long, boring story about the existence of an ancient Native American civilization which disappeared for unknown reasons.\n\nPresent Day. Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) is on board an airplane and has a nightmare, in which he remembers how he hid himself in a high-voltage box as a child, while staring at some alien-like creatures.\n\nAs an adult (explaining in a voice-over narration), Edward looks for remains of an extinct Indian tribe, the Abkani, which disappeared suddenly 10,000 years ago for reasons unexplained. He's found a trinket piece of something related to it. On his way to the museum where Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid), an assistant curator and Edward's ex-girlfriend, works and is scanning some more Abkani pieces, he is attacked by somebody with supernatural abilities named James Pinkerton (Ed Anders) who tries to steal the artifact that he has, but Edward fights him off.\n\nAt the same time, Professor Lionel Hudgens (Matthew Walker) almost doesn't make it alive from a sea voyage, where he finds the \"edegus\" or something like that. The ship's crew finds a coffin made of gold from the ocean floor. After they dock, the evil and greedy captain of the salvage tug locks up Hudgens and his men open the gold coffin... even though Hudgens asks them not to do so. Five minutes afterwards, they are all dead but for Hudgens, imprisoned inside a storage room on the ship. Hudgens slips away ashore after collecting another item from the empty gold coffin, which apparently contained a mysterious creature.\n\nUpon the opening of the gold coffin, an old friend of Edward disappears into the night. Several other people across the USA and Canada walk off in a trance as if being drawn by some beacon. Edward hears a ear-splitting screech while in his apartment looking over the Abkani artifact. At the same time in an underground military facility, called Research Agency Bureau 713, the location of the opening of the gold coffin is relayed by the control room techs who report it to their bureau chief by the evidence of the electro-magnetic wave that appears on their monitors.\n\nEdward, a paranormal investigator and former agent of Bureau 713, thinks it's related to the Abkani. The old friend was a fellow orphan, from when Hudgens convinced Sister Clara (Karin Konoval) to run some experiments on the children without anybody's consent (shown in another flashback). Edward investigates.\n\nEdward arrives that same evening at the Natural History Museum where he is reunited with a not-so-happy Aline with the artifact and she shows him another Abkani artifact that recently arrived and she has been working on it since Professor Hudgens is away. Just then, the mysterious creature from the ship attacks them inside the museum, killing a security guard, but Edward and Aline hide in a storage closet long enough for troopers from Bureau 713 to arrive, and the creature (which is a four-legged, fast-moving beast resembling a cross between a panther and the creatures of 'Aliens') retreats into the night.\n\nCommander Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff), the team leader of the Bureau 713 strike force, arrives where Edward tries to relay information to him that something big is going down, but Burke rebukes him, saying that since he no longer works for Bureau 713, to stay out of their investigation.\n\nThe next day, Edward tries to get information from his former co-workers at Bureau 713, one of whom is staff surgeon and pathologist Sam Fischer (Frank C. Turner), to learn more about the creature encountered as well as the history of the Abkani.\n\nAt the same time, Professor Hudges arrives back at the museum where he goes to his office where he has a captured creature (whether this is the same creature from the ship or a different one is never fully explained). Hudgens uses a syringe to draw fluid from the captive creature to study it as part of his further research to combine the DNA of man and beast.\n\nEdward continues investigating his past by going to his former orphanage to learn more about Hudges research, and then back to his apartment where Aline is and they consumate their attraction to each other.\n\nWhile the Bureau 713 soldiers are patroling the museum, they are attacked by several creatures, who are the missing people that wondered off upon the opening of the gold coffin containing the creature. During the firefight, several soldiers, and most of the human-creatures are killed. Edward arrives on the scene and talks more with Burke, who again tells him away. However, during a scuffle, Edward picks Burke's pocket containing his Bureau 713 security badge.\n\nThe next morning, Edward goes to Bureau 713 where he talks with Fischer in the morgue looking at one of the dead bodies, where Fischer shows Edward a small, cenntipede-like baby creature in the dorsal spine of his old friend Pinkeron. Fischer also discovers that Edward has one of his own in his body, but it is dead, presumably because of the contact with the electro-shock while Edward was a child. Fischer tells him that he could take the creature out, but leaving him disabled. As the monster looks dead, it's not an urgent matter. Burke and his men arrive and escort Edward out of the morgue and the building.\n\nThat evening, Professor Hudges ambushes Fischer as he arrives home to find his wife dead. Hudges inserts a baby creature into Fischer's mouth, thereby putting him under his control.\n\nEdward discovers that the Abkani had fought those creatures which can get killed by light (that's why they always move around on dark places). They also disrupt electrical light, creating blackouts. The Abkani artifacts found all over the world actually open the gate to another dimension, where millions of those creatures are sleeping, waiting to be freed and kill humans. Hudgens is making further experiments with the creature he's captured somehow when he takes some of the creature's blood and injects it into his veins. That way, he becomes a semi-alien being and can control the monsters.\n\nAt the climax, Aline, Edward, Burke and the latter's military squad go to Edward's orphanage, where there are strong electro-magnetic disruptions. They are attacked by dozens of these reptilian-like monsters and there is a climactic and violent 20-minute fight where almost all creatures and humans kill one another. Edward, Burke and Aline reach the old surgery room underground where the baby creature was transplanted into Edward. There, Hudgens takes Edward's piece of archeological remains and opens the gate. Millions of creatures start to wake up and run down a huge cave. They go down the walls but they don't approach the gate for some reason, giving time for the three good characters to kill Hudgens, run away only to realize that they can't detonate the bomb from such a long distance. Burke comes back and blows everything up... himself along with the creatures.\n\nEdward and Aline rise to the surface at the back of the orphanage at dawn, only to find an evacuated city without people, cars abandoned on the streets. They walk down the street, but several noises are heard. The last shot shows them in the middle of an empty road turning around suddenly, supposedly to confront one of the creatures.... regardless of it being day.\n\nAren't the monsters hurt by light? Because the gate hasn't been closed properly, the door has been left open for a second installment. (No, please!)"

    "Along Came a Spider": "The daughter of a United States Senator is kidnapped from her private school under the nose of her Secret Service agent Jezzie [Monica Potter]. The kidnapper is a teacher who uses the girl's habit for \"passing\" encrypted notes to her friend, the son of the Russian President, as a pretext for getting her away from other students to repremand her. He drugs her and flees the campus with her in tow.\n\nThe kidnapper, Mr. Soneji, contacts the famous profiler Alex Cross [Morgan Freeman] to initiate the chase he has so dramatically laid out in his mind, The Secret Service agent, Jezzie Flannigan, who let the kidnappers get away with her charge, Megan Rose, pleads with Cross [Freeman] to let her help retrieve the girl so she can redeem herself. They both follow the clues that allude to the famous Lindbergh kidnapping case. They realize that the kidnapped Megan is being used to lure the real intended target away from his tight security; the son of the Russian president.\n\nMeanwhile Megan is being held on a boat and taking an active role in her own rescue, trying to escape and cleverly creating havoc; she takes the battery pack out of the intercom, asks to go to the bathroom, dropping the battery pack onto the stove next to the open flame under the teapot. It explodes, & while Soneji battles the blaze she runs out & jumps overboard. She catches the attention of a fisherman on shore; just as he is about to reach Megan, Soneji shoots him. He hauls Megan back on board...Soneji 1, Megan 0.\n\nAfter Alex & Jezzie are rejected when trying to warn the Russians, they decide to stake out the place anyway & Soneji makes his move against Demetri by tricking him into thinking he's corresponding w/ Megan. Demetri evades his security & goes to a phone booth. Meanwhile, Soneji has killed the 2 patrolmen & commandeered their car. He exits the car, moving toward the phone booth, but Alex & Jezzie see him. Gunfight ensues, Demetri is saved, but Soneji gets away. He returns to the boat to find that Megan is gone.\n\nOur erstwhile heroes get a phone call, saying the plan has changed & he wants $10mil in diamonds. There follows a lot of rigamarole w/ Cross carrying around a load of diamonds, following instructions from the voice on the phone. Unaware that Soneji no longer has the girl, Cross is running all over Washington DC, answering phones and running through train stations with the diamonds in a thermos for the complicated \"drop\", only his new partner on his tail for backup. Defeated, after having handed over the diamonds and getting no girl, the duo returns to Jezzie's apartment to discuss the case when there is a knock on the door. It's Mr Soneji with a Tazer in the Hall! He zaps Jezzie and she falls to the floor. He draws a gun on Alex who must give up his own gun or never find out where Megan Rose is. After a discussion of his miserable childhood & why he is the way he is, Soneji says he's taking Jezzie w/ him, but she wakes up and stabs him in the leg, allowing Cross time to load a shotgun and put an end to him. Jezzie sobs that they will never find Megan now. But Cross reveals to Agent McArthur (Dylan Baker) that Soneji had failed to react to a comment made by Cross about the $12mil ransom, from which he has concluded, since the ransom was $10mil, that Soneji had no idea what he was talking about, Megan is no longer with him & there are other kidnappers in play.\n\nCross & Agent McArthur go over the school tapes, & Cross deduces that Soneji was hoodwinked by the new kidnappers. Meanwhile, we see Megan in her new kidnapper's abode. A faintly familiar face appears in a dimly lit room and is offering food to Megan. It's another Secret Service agent from her school and LO & BEHOLD! it's Agent Devine! He leaves her in her barn location, returning to the main house. & HOLY BETRAYAL! JEZZIE! They had followed Soneji around for a year & divined his plans. She demands to know where Megan is and is annoyed to learn she is still alive. She asks to see the diamonds and explains that Soneji is dead and Cross had twigged on the notion that he was not the sole plotter in the kidnapping. Divine asks if she thinks Cross is onto them. Jezzie says they are not onto the two of them, and blows a hole in her boyfriend's head commenting that Cross is onto HIM.\n\nMeanwhile Alex has timed the surveillance tapes from the day of the school kidnapping and puts it together that Agent Divine was essentially an accomplice. He runs to Jezzie's apartment and finds files on her computer that only the plotter would have! Things start to happen fast. Jezzie goes to the barn to get Megan, who initially is glad she's there but soon gets suspicious that there's no one else w/ her...smart girl! A nasty 1-sided gunfight ensues, with Jezzie chasing Megan all over the barn & Megan cleverly evading her. Alex catches Megan & keeps her from yelling while Jezzie slowly enters the trap. Alex comes up behind her, telling her to drop the gun. She doesn't, playing on Alex's guilt over his partner's death, thinking he won't shoot her...big mistake, as she raises her gun, & he does. Alex & Megan walk out of the barn together, his promise to return her to her parents puts smiles on all around."

    "Amar Akbar Anthony": "On the 15th of August, a chauffeur named Kishanlal (Pran) is released from prison after taking the blame for a fatal hit-and-run accident committed by his employer, the notorious crime boss Robert (Jeevan). Despite Robert's assurance that his family's welfare will be looked after, Kishanlal discovers that Robert did not lift even a finger for the man's family-coming home to three starving sons and his wife Bharati (Nirupa Roy), who is now suffering from tuberculosis. Kishanlal seeks help from Robert, who instead humiliates him and orders his henchmen to kill him. Kishanlal inadvertently escapes in one of Robert's cars loaded with smuggled gold bullion, given chase by Robert's henchmen.\n\nKishanlal returns home to find his sons abandoned by his wife, who had left a suicide note. He takes his sons and leaves them at the foot of a Mahatma Gandhi statue in a public park while he drives off to draw the pursuing henchmen away. In an inflamed car crash, Kishanlal is presumed dead by the henchman and the passing police but survives and has run away with the gold. Before his return, each of his three sons, who've separated from the statue and each other, are found and adopted by a Hindu policeman, a Muslim tailor, and a Christian priest respectively. Bharati, who attempts suicide, is instead struck by a falling branch and loses her eyesight as punishment for leaving her sons behind; even becoming distraught to hear from the police that Kishanlal and the boys seemingly died from the car crash. she is also saved by the same Muslim tailor who picked up her youngest son (but can't recognize him as she is blind now). Kishanlal returns to the park but finds all 3 of his kids missing.\n\n22 years later, the eldest son is now a policeman named Amar Khanna (Vinod Khanna); the middle-born is a licensed liquor dealer named Anthony Gonsalves (Amitabh Bachchan), and the youngest is a Qawwali singer named Akbar Ilahabadi (Rishi Kapoor), who has fallen in love with a young doctor named Salma Ali (Neetu Singh). The three meet when they donate blood for a hit-and-run victim, unaware that they are related and that the recipient Bharati, who now sells flowers, is their mother. Akbar is initially viewed scornfully by Salma's father, Tayyaib Ali (Mukri). Amar falls in love with a one-time petty crook named Lakshmi (Shabana Azmi), taking her and her grandmother to his home after arresting her abusive stepmother and stepbrother. Anthony falls in love with Jennie (Parveen Babi), an Anglo-Indian who has returned from London, after meeting her at a church sermon.\n\nIn the meantime, Kishanlal created his own crime syndicate from the smuggled gold, destroying Robert's business and forced Robert to work for him. Kishanlal had also taken in Robert's daughter, revealed to be Jennie, as his niece and previously send her to school in London before picking her up following her return. However, a police raid was laid on one of Kishanlal's loading docks, forcing Kishanlal and his men to escape while letting Robert escape with another shipment of gold bullion, regaining his former position and becoming Kishanlal's rival. He is determined to retrieve Jennie for himself. While escaping Robert shoots Amar's stepfather. While running from the police, Anothny hides Robert in exchange for 2/3rd of the gold. Amar finds that Anthony had given shelter to Robert and arrests him. Kishanlal rescues Anthony while he is being taken to court. Kishanlal questions Anthony about Robert's whereabouts. Anthony doesn't say a word, he escapes and goes back to the police station to surrender himself as he doesn't want Amar to get into trouble on his account. Anthony takes Amar to the hiding place when he learns that Robert shot Amar's stepfather. But Robert had already escaped by then.\n\nKishanlal is double-crossed by one of his bodyguards Zebisco (Yusuf Khan), who betrays Jennie to Robert in exchange for her hand in marriage. Kishanlal rescues Jennie and a car chase ensues. Kishanlal drops Jennie at a safe location to draw the attackers away from her. She is rescued by Anthony. Meanwhile Kishanlal crashes his car, and Akbar saves him from being run over by Robert. Robert finds Kishanlal in a hospital where Akbar admitted him. He finds Bharati in the same hospital, who had come to meet Akbar. Robert recognizes Bharati and kidnaps her (Salma is a doctor at the same hospital and finds out that Kishanlal is Bharati's husband) but has a car accident and she escapes. Bharati miraculously regains her eyesight at a festival in honor of Sai Baba of Shirdi hosted by Akbar. She recognizes him as her youngest son Raju (from a photo hanging in the house) thanks to his adoptive father recognizing Bharati as the woman he rescued from the falling branch years ago.\n\nSalma meets Akbar and informs him that she knows about Bharathi's husband. Akbar now knows that Kishanlal is his dad. When they go to the hospital, Kishanlal is already gone. Akbar seeks Amar's help and gives him their original home address. Amar remembers the address and goes there. Kishanlal had gone there and finds Amar looking for a gun which he had hidden 22 years ago. Kishanlal recognizes Amar as his eldest son and now Amar knows that Akbar is his youngest brother. Jennie was with Anthony's adoptive father and learned the story of how he found Anthony 23 years ago. She remembers the story of how Kishanlal lost his 3 sons and immediately calls him to let him know that Anthony is one of his lost sons but is cut off by Zibesco.\n\nJennie is kidnapped, resulting in Anthony's adoptive father's death by Robert when the priest tries to stop him. Lakshmi is also kidnapped by her abusive stepbrother Ranjeet (Ranjeet), who is working for Robert. Anthony finds Kishanlal's locket in his dead adoptive father's hands, which Robert had stolen from Kishanlal at the hospital. Anthony confronts Kishanlal and learns that he is Kishanlal's son. In their pursuit of justice against Robert, the brothers discover their mutual heritage with each other along with Kishanlal and Bharati, reuniting the family once again.\n\nAkbar, Amar, and Anthony respectively pose as an elderly tailor, a one-man band, and a Catholic priest, and infiltrate Robert's mansion along with Salma. Salma rescues Jennie and Lakshmi, while Robert and his henchmen are beaten up by the brothers, arrested, and sent to prison. Due to his past crimes, Kishanlal is sent to prison as well, but he comforts Bharati by telling her that their sons are reunited, which is the only thing that matters to him the most.

    "Ambulance": "War veteran Will Sharp (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), desperately in need of $231,000 for his wife Amy's surgery, reaches out to Danny (Jake Gyllenhaal), his adoptive brother and a life-long criminal, who talks him into taking part in a $32 million bank heist. Danny need Will as a driver, since Will is an excellent driver and can drive anything. Though initially hesitant, Will agrees after Danny reaffirms that he is doing this for Amy. The plan nearly succeeds until Officer Zach (Jackson White), who goes to the bank to ask out a bank teller, discovers the situation and is held hostage by Danny. The money is stuffed into 4 bags, which means $8 million per bag. A shootout then occurs between one of the heist members and Zach's partner Officer Mark (Cedric Sanders).\n\nThe Special Investigation Section (SIS) of the LAPD arrives and shoots down the whole crew except Will and Danny, who retreat towards the garage. The SIS was tracking Danny and his crew from the beginning but were late to the scene as Danny did not use the vehicle that the SIS had put a tracker on. Will and Danny escape with 1 bag each. Zach attempts to escape and during a scuffle between him and Danny, he is accidentally shot by Will. Will wants to stop and help Zach, but Danny forces Will to leave Zach and run. Mark finds Zach and calls in an Ambulance.\n\nLeaving Zach to die, the brothers attempt to exit through the back of the building but find it surrounded by police. They then hijack an ambulance with EMT Cam Thompson (Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez) on board, who is treating the injured Zach. Cam is known to be the best paramedic in town who can keep anyone alive for 20 minutes. But she has no friends. Cam is held hostage by Danny. Danny forces Cam to convince the SIS team to let them through the barricade as she has a dying cop inside the ambulance. Meanwhile Mark finds the injured Ambulance driver and realizes that it has been hijacked. After a chase that leads them into an alleyway, Cam makes a desperate attempt to escape using a fire extinguisher but is quickly recaptured by Danny.\n\nSIS Captain Monroe (Garret Dillahunt) arrives on the scene and deploys helicopters to chase after the ambulance. Danny tells Will to keep driving towards their back up car location. Cam gets Danny to help her use a defibrillator and Will to transfer some of his blood to Zach, much to his confusion and frustration. Danny wants to keep Zach alive, as he knows that killing a cop would lead to dire consequences for him. Meanwhile Monroe orders using electronic sniping to figure out the communication units on board the ambulance. They find a satellite phone and police scanners on board. Danny then calls Papi (A Martinez), one of his father's criminal friends, for help losing the police in exchange for $8 million. Papi and his son Roberto start to outfit a car with heavy ammunition.\n\nWhen Cam stops Danny from shooting Mark, who has been chasing them, Danny threatens to throw her off the ambulance. The police are forced to retreat when it is discovered that Monroe's dog is inside Mark's police vehicle. FBI Agent Anson Clark (Keir O'Donnell), a past friend of Danny's, is put on the case. Clark says that Danny has been robbing banks since he was 17 years old. And his father is a known psychotic. Clark says that Danny is looking for a way out since he did not kill the cop. Will tells Danny not to hurt Cam.\n\nZach begins to bleed out; Cam, with Will's assistance, begins to perform surgery on Zach. Despite her inexperience and a ruptured spleen, Cam successfully performs the surgery with advise on phone from doctors who are specialists at this. Danny had taken over the driving as Will helped Cam. Cam tries to convince Will to stop Danny, to no avail. Will tells Cam that he will get her out alive. The phone line to the doctors got cut due to low battery as Zach's spleen burst while being taken out. In that scenario a patient has 60 seconds to live. Cam was able to block the artery with a clamp, but the doctors didn't know that. Monroe, unaware of the surgery's success, moves forward with the operation and prepares to snipe Will and Danny without negotiating for Cam's life.\n\nClark calls Cam, on Zach's phone which was still on his person inside the ambulance and tells her to get down. Cam, wanting to save Zach's life, alerts Will and Danny about the snipers. Danny, having had enough of Cam, decides to shoot her but Will intervenes, causing the brothers to fight about their predicament. They later partially reconcile and listen to music together to ease the tension.\n\nIn the Los Angeles River, helicopters chase the ambulance as Danny shoots at them. Will and Danny then drive on the opposite lane of the interstate, creating multiple accidents. Danny hides his ambulance under a bridge, where it is painted blue by Papi's men. Danny says that this is Will's window to walk away, but Will refuses to go. He won't leave Danny. Cam learns that Will has a daughter and that his wife has cancer and needs the money for her surgery. From under the bridge, many ambulances are driven away in different directions, to confuse Monroe's teams.\n\nOn Papi's orders, his son, Roberto (Jesse Garcia), drives an empty ambulance towards the police after filling it with C-4 explosives and deploys machine guns on separate cars to cause additional damage, which ends up wounding Monroe in the crossfire. Mark had seen Roberto escape after jumping out of the loaded ambulance and gives chase.\n\nMark chases down Roberto and fatally shoots him after a scuffle, leaving Papi angry and distraught. Will and Danny escape to Papi's hideout. Papi demands the brothers to leave Zach and Cam with them to deal with; Will refuses to cooperate and teams up with Danny to kill Papi and his crew. In the ambulance, Zach regains consciousness and gives his Partner's gun to Cam.\n\nIn the chaos, Cam accidentally shoots Will using Zach's gun. Danny puts Will into the Ambulance. Will takes a bundle of cash and gives it to Cam, begging her to give it to his wife. Danny takes the ambulance to a hospital and discovers Zach's gun. He is enraged when Cam reveals that she was the one who shot Will. Danny says that Will was the one who saved Zach and Cam. Danny vows to kill Cam along with himself on live television, before confronting the police.\n\nWill, left with no other choice, shoots Danny in the back. Danny apologizes to Will before he dies from his injuries. The police arrest a heavily injured Will and take him inside for surgery after Cam says that he saved Zach's life. Cam secretly gives some of the heist money to Amy for her surgery, and Zach, when questioned by the police about his injuries, tells them that Will saved his life."

    "American Assassin": "While vacationing in Spain, Mitch Rapp (played by Dylan O'Brien) proposes to his girlfriend. She accepts but a few minutes later dies when a jihadist cell lands and guns down the tourists. The purpose was to make Americans see how it feels to have your loved ones killed. The attack has the opposite effect: Mitch survives and lives to hunt down and kill those responsible.\n\nMitch physically trains to be ready for the confrontation. Unknown to him, the watchful American government is impressed with his training. CIA agent Irene Kennedy (Sanaa Lathan) recruits him for a 'black ops' team and sends him to Dan Hurley (Michael Keaton), a former Navy Seal, for further training.\n\nWorld events move faster than expected, so Dan takes Mitch to Istanbul. In Turkey they meet with CIA agent Annika (Shiva Negar). Mitch and Annika pretend to be newlyweds in order to cover their real mission: prevent the jihadist construction of a nuclear bomb. Things don't go according to plan so Mitch improvises. Though he disobeys direct orders, his improvisation gets results.\n\nFurther complicating this, Ghost (Taylor Kitsch), now a mercenary but formerly a member of Dan's group, works for the bad guys. In another plot twist, Annika works for the Iranian government. Too many things go wrong and the operation becomes a joint CIA and Mossad (Israel intelligence) collaboration. A final chase ends with the bomb headed for the U.S. navy fleet.\n\nMitch throws the bomb overboard to let it detonate deep in the ocean. In the aftermath, an Iranian military man (secretly tied to the creation of the bomb) publicly blames the problems of his country on the U. S., which he promises to eliminate. He then gets into an elevator. Standing behind him is Mitch - the American Assassin."

    "American Sniper": "In the opening scene, US Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) is perched on a rooftop, scoping out the path of a US military convoy through his sniper rifle. He sees a man on a rooftop talking on a cell phone, and he appears to be watching the convoy, which Kyle reports it through his headset. He is told that if the man is reporting troop movement, he has the green light to shoot him, but Kyle is unsure. His marine backup suggests that he may just be talking to his girlfriend on the phone. The man disappears from the rooftop and a few moments later, a woman and a young boy appear in the doorway of the same building and walk toward the convoy. Kyle reports the woman and boy, noting that the woman is not swinging her arms as she walks and appears to be carrying something. No one in the convoy can see it to confirm. He watches through the scope as the woman removes something from her cloak and hands it to the boy, and he realizes that it is a grenade. He again gets the green light to shoot, but his marine guard warns him that he will be sent to prison for shooting a child, if he's wrong.\n\nThe film cuts to a young Chris hunting with his father, and he shoots and kills a deer. His father congratulates him on his excellent shot, telling him he has a gift. Chris happily approaches the deer, dropping his gun to the ground as he runs to it. His father reprimands him for treating his gun cavalierly.\n\nOver several scenes set in his childhood, we see young Chris, his younger brother Jeff and his parents attend church, where he pockets a small well-worn copy of the New Testament. There's also a scene of Jeff being beat up by a much larger kid on a playground. Chris runs up and pulls the bully off, beating him up. In the next scene, seated at the family's dinner table, Chris' father tells the boys that there are three kinds of people in the world - sheep, wolves and sheepdogs. Sheep don't believe that there is evil in the world, wolves are predators who commit evil, and sheepdogs are blessed with the aggression and bravery to protect the world from evil. The speech clearly makes an impact on Chris.\n\nYears later, Chris is competing in rodeos with his younger brother traveling alongside him. He returns home one night and finds his girlfriend in bed with another man. He hits the man several times and kicks him out before turning around to kick his girlfriend out. She complains that he abandons her every weekend to go to rodeos, believing himself to be a cowboy when he's just a failed farmer.\n\nAs Chris and his brother watch TV, they see the news of the August 1998 terrorist attacks on the US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. Chris is angry that US citizens are being attacked and feels compelled to do something to protect his country.\n\nHe visits a US navy office and talks to the recruiter. The recruiter suggests that Kyle might be interested in the SEAL program and hands him a pamphlet, but Kyle remarks that he's not much of a swimmer. The recruiter takes the pamphlet out of his hand and says that it's not for most men, but Kyle retorts that he's not most men.\n\nKyle goes through the rigorous training process, which includes being blasted with a powerful hose while exercising, laying down on the beach and letting the cold surf wash over him as well as being verbally harassed by the officers who run training, mocking him for being too old to be a SEAL at the age of 30. He also goes through sniper training, bringing in his hunting background. The instructor reminds them to 'aim small, miss small' - if they aim for a button on a man's shirt, they might miss by only two inches, but if they aim for the shirt altogether, they might miss by two feet. His instructor also tells him to keep his non-scoping eye closed, to better focus on the target. Kyle responds that he needs to keep both eyes open to see what else is out there. The instructor tells him that they are shooting at a target, and there's nothing else out there, and reprimands him with 50 push ups. Kyle proves him wrong by shooting a snake, hidden in the grass on the shooting range.\n\nIn the mean time, Kyle meets a woman named Taya (Sienna Miller) at a bar one night. She tells him that she would never marry a SEAL, as her sister did but was cheated on and lied to constantly. She also challenges him at drinking shots, showing off how tough she is, but she ends up vomiting outside the bar. Kyle is kind to her, holding her hair back and taking care of her. He calls her repeatedly until she agrees to date him, and their relationship progresses. She asks him at one point if she ever thinks about who will be at the end of his gun, and he tells her that he just wants to protect his country. On their wedding day, he and his fellow SEALs receive word that they will be deployed to Iraq, which they celebrate.\n\nThe film cuts back to the opening scene and Kyle watches the woman hand the grenade off to the young boy. As the young boy starts running toward the convoy with the grenade in his hand, Kyle pulls the trigger and kills him. The woman starts wailing and running toward the boy, and Kyle watches her closely. The woman runs past the boy's body to grab the grenade he dropped and continue running at the convoy. She is about to fling the grenade at it when Kyle shoots her. The grenade falls short of the convoy and explodes, leaving the troops unharmed.\n\nKyle returns to the base camp where a fellow SEAL congratulates him on his first kill. Kyle doesn't appear to regret the killing but admits that he didn't think this is what it would be like to protect his country.\n\nKyle continues to provide overwatch for marine units who are going door-to-door through an evacuated city, searching for an al Qaeda leader named Zarqawi. They are told that any military-aged male who remained in the city should be considered a threat. Kyle successfully watches over the troops, shooting many would-be attackers who carry guns and bombs. Kyle is dedicated to his job, even urinating in his post to avoid abandoning his watch. After a particular watch, Kyle reports that he had six kills, which is more than all the other snipers combined in the same shift. His fellow troops begin calling him The Legend. Also, a bounty has been placed on their heads by al Qaeda. Kyle also hears of an al Qaeda sniper who won a gold medal for shooting in the Olympics called Mustafa, known for making nearly-impossible shots.\n\nSeveral times throughout, Kyle talks to his pregnant wife on the phone and she tries to get him to be honest and tell her about what he's going through. He resists but they talk and laugh together. She complains that she has to put the crib together by herself and they express how much they miss each other. She also tells Kyle that his younger brother has been deployed to Iraq as well.\n\nAt times, Kyle complain about being assigned to overwatch as he wants to be on the ground with the troops going door-to-door. He believes his training makes him better equipped than the Marines doing the job, and he can't protect them on overwatch once they're inside a building. He finally abandons his overwatch post and joins the Marines on the ground who welcome The Legend. As they go door to door they find a home where the family has refused to evacuate. The man tells them that it is his home, and he will not abandon it. Kyle questions the man with the help of an interpreter, showing him a picture of Zarqawi and asks him if he knows who he is. The man says that Zarqawi's second in command is a man known as the Butcher. He can give Kyle information on the Butcher, but he wants $100,000 in return. Kyle promises to help him, and the man provides a name. Kyle has the name checked out, which turns out to be useful intelligence, so they prepare to bring the cash to the man.\n\nAs the SEALs drive back to the man's home to bring him the money, Kyle calls Taya, who tells him that she has just learned their baby is a boy. Kyle is overjoyed when his vehicle is suddenly attacked and he drops the phone while it is still connected. Taya listens in horror to gunfire and screaming, unsure of what is going on. Mustafa is shooting at the men, and Kyle tries to take him out but is unable to do so as he is pinned down by gunfire. The Butcher found out that the man gave up information to the troops, and he kills the man's young son with a handheld power drill. He also shoots the man and screams out a warning to anyone who cooperates with the US military. The Butcher and Mustafa both get away unharmed. More troops arrive, and Kyle and his men are able to get out safely. A few days later, the troops return and Taya tearfully reunites with Kyle.\n\nKyle tries to adjust to life back at home. Taya finds Kyle watching a video of US soldiers being killed by a sniper and rushes to shut it off when he sees her. She tells him that she wants him to open up, but he doesn't want her to know about the atrocities they're facing in Iraq. The video shows Mustafa's kills, which he records and sells.\n\nWhile at the obstetrician's office for a check up, the doctor asks him how he's doing, to which he responds that he's fine. She takes his blood pressure which is very high at 170/110. Both the doctor and Taya are extremely concerned about him, but Kyle brushes off their concerns and says he will take care of it. As they drive away, Taya tries to get him to open up, but Kyle just repeats that he's fine. However, as he's talking, he grows more frustrated as he tells her that he doesn't understand why everybody isn't talking about what's going on in Iraq and how people are just going about their every day lives. Taya goes into labor and they rush to the hospital where she gives birth to their son.\n\nAfter arriving in Iraq, Kyle sees his younger brother marching with his troop. Kyle cheerfully greets Jeff who is about to be sent home and is much more battle-worn and conflicted. Jeff wearily walks away and tells Kyle, \"fuck this country.\"\n\nKyle redeploys for a second and third tour in Iraq, continuing to hunt down the Butcher. The bounty on his head has been increased, and he jokes that his wife may go after it herself. In their search for the Butcher, Kyle leads a team of SEALs, including men he has served with for a long time, and they are clearly a close-knit group. One of his men, Mark begins to express regret about the war, and Kyle reminds him that they are patriots serving their country and protecting their families.\n\nOn one mission, the team gets intelligence that the Butcher may be hiding out in a particular building. The team breaks into a home across the street from the building though the man that lives there with his family says that they have no knowledge of any terrorist activity. The SEALs watch the building from the home, realizing they will have a hard time getting in when the man tells them that it is a holiday and he wants to invite them to be guests at his table. The SEALs join them for a meal, eating and talking boisterously. The man reaches across the table to his son, and Kyle notices that his elbows are rubbed raw. Since snipers often spend considerable amounts of time held up on their elbows, causing callouses like the ones the man has, this tips him off that the man might not be as innocent as he professed. He gets up under the pretense that he's going to the bathroom and searches the apartment until he finds a hidden compartment in the floor filled with guns and weapons. He returns to the dining table, taking the man into the other room and showing him what he has found. He tells the man that he will help the SEALs get into the building. At gunpoint, they force the man to knock on the door. The door opens to allow the man in, as he is clearly known to the people inside, when a sniper takes out the door opener. The man grabs the door opener's gun and tries to shoot at the SEALs who take him out. The SEALs enter the building, clearing room after room looking for the Butcher who escapes through back tunnels.\n\nWhile at an auto body shop, a young Marine approaches Kyle and tells him that Kyle had saved his life once in years past. The Marine asks Kyle if he would go down to the VA sometime to talk with veterans. He also talks with Kyle's son, telling him that his father is a hero and allowed him to go home to his own daughter. Kyle is gracious but feels uncomfortable with all the praise the young man gives him.\n\nBetween deployments, Kyle continues to struggle to readjust to civilian life. Loud noises seem to startle him deeply. Taya gives birth to their second child, a daughter. When Kyle visits the hospital, he sees his daughter in the nursery and she begins to cry. The nurse is handling another baby and doesn't immediately attend to Kyle's daughter, and he becomes increasingly agitated, screaming at the nurse. His wife bitterly remarks that he is missing his kids' childhoods, and she has to create memories by herself. He argues that he is protecting the family and his country by doing his job, but Taya wants him to protect them at home.\n\nIn a casual conversation, another SEAL, Biggles reveals that he's purchased an engagement ring locally to save money. The men tease him about the quality and possible blood origins but Biggles laughs it off and says he will tell his girlfriend it's from Zales. In an ensuing battle, Biggles is shot in the face by Mustafa and they rush him back to the base where he goes into surgery. Biggles asks Kyle to promise to deliver the engagement ring he bought to his girlfriend back home, no matter what happens. The troops head back out immediately, burning to get revenge and Mark is shot during the mission and presumably killed. Biggles survives and is brought stateside for medical treatment.\n\nAfter his third tour, Kyle still cannot connect with his family and his home life. He visits Biggles in the hospital who seems to be in good spirits. Biggles shares that he is now engaged, having purchased a new ring that is actually from Zales, despite trying to warn his girlfriend that her life will be much more difficult being married to him. Kyle doesn't seem to comprehend what could be difficult about being marring to a SEAL, saying she's lucky to be married to a patriot who fights for his country.\n\nKyle still feels compelled to return to the war. He fights with his wife about it, with Taya demanding to know if he has a death wish. She says he's done his duty and it's somebody else's turn to go. She also tells him that if he leaves again, she and the children will not be waiting for him when he returns. He tries to smooth things over but deploys yet again.\n\nKyle tries to call Taya but it goes to voice-mail. While talking with another SEAL, Kyle finds out that Biggles has died in a recent surgery stateside. During one overwatch post, Kyle watches a man walks out onto the street carrying a grenade launcher. Kyle kills the man. A young boy who had been playing nearby is startled and runs over. Kyle is concerned that the young boy will try to pick up the grenade launcher and he will have to kill him. The young boy struggles to get the grenade launcher on his shoulder, and Kyle prepares himself to shoot the boy. The boy finally gives up and runs away, and Kyle is clearly relieved.\n\nKyle and his team are told that engineers are trying to construct a wall around the city but a sniper keeps picking them off from over 1,000 yards away, leading the team to believe it is Mustafa.The team is sent out despite an oncoming sandstorm to try to take him out and protect the troops constructing the wall. They head out into the city and take their places on a rooftop, aiming at the direction they believe Mustafa is shooting from. However, Mustafa moves quickly and shoots from a different angle, killing another soldier constructing the wall, causing the SEALs to scramble to change their set up.\n\nKyle believes he's spotted Mustafa through the scope though the rest of the team has a hard time believing him, as he's over 2,000 yards away. They don't think he can see Mustafa let alone shoot him at that distance. Also, the team spots many insurgents walking around the building and if Kyle takes a shot, it will alert them to the SEALs' location where they will be vastly outnumbered. The leader calls in a response team from the base, which will take some time to arrive. They warn Kyle not to take the shot and endanger them all until they have backup. One of the SEALs encourages Kyle to take the shot if he believes he can do it.\n\nKyle takes the shot, killing Mustafa, but the insurgents hear the gunshot and swarm the roof. The four SEALs try to conserve their ammo and take out the terrorists one by one that are rushing in on them. The backup is on its way but hasn't yet arrived so the men are on their own. Kyle tearfully calls Taya and tells her that he's ready to come home. The men shoot their way off the roof as the backup finally arrives as does the sandstorm. The men try to run into the vehicle but they have little to no visibility, struggling to see the truck, shoot the insurgents and protect each other. Three of the SEALs run into the truck bed but Kyle falls behind when he's shot. They slow down for him and he barely makes it back into the truck.\n\nKyle returns home. He is still not connected to his home life. At a family barbecue, Taya catches him watching the TV intently as if it were on, when it is actually off. She tries to get him to join the party, and they watch the children play. A dog grabs the collar of a boy and is tugging at it. Kyle suddenly rips off his belt and grabs the dog as if he might beat or strangle it until Taya cries out in horror.\n\nKyle goes to a doctor who tells him that according to his military records, Kyle has been credited with 160 kills, more than anyone else in US history. The doctor asks if he has any regrets about killing those people, and Kyle's response is that he doesn't regret that, he only regrets not saving more American troops. The doctor tells him that there are American troops who could use his help at home. He takes Kyle to a support group of disabled veterans, many of whom have lost limbs. The men share their stories, and Kyle decides to take some of the men out to a shooting range and teach them to shoot sniper rifles. After hitting a target, one of the men remarks that it's the first time he's felt like a man since he was injured in battle.\n\nKyle has finally regained himself, playing with his children and connecting with his wife. He teaches his young son to hunt, telling him that it's serious business to end a heartbeat. He continues his work with veterans. Taya tells him how proud she is of him, for finding himself and finding his way back to his family. He tells her that a Marine's mom reached out to him, asking if he would help her son out who's been struggling since his return. Kyle opens the door and an uneasy young man waits for him by his truck while Taya watches. The door closes, and the final credits reveal that the troubled young Marine killed Chris Kyle i.e. 'Chris Kyle was killed that day by a veteran he was trying to help'."

    "American Ultra": "Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg) is in a holding cell, handcuffed and trembling. A man enters the room while another (Bill Pullman) watches them. Mike sees flashes of the last few days, as well as items such as a bloody spoon, a frying pan, and a shot-up teddy bear.\n\nThree days earlier:\n\nMike was living peacefully in the small town of Liman, West Virginia with his girlfriend Phoebe (Kristen Stewart). He's a stoner-slacker and he is head-over-heels in love with Phoebe. Mike planned a surprise trip to Hawaii for the two of them where he hoped to propose to her, but they missed their flight because he was having a panic attack in the bathroom. Mike apologizes to Phoebe repeatedly but she forgives him. En route back they're stopped by the local sheriff, who knows Mike well. He welcomes them back to town in a kind of warning way.\n\nMike returns to his dead-end job as a clerk at the local convenience store. Since business is slow, he kills time by drawing cartoons and rolling joints. Mike draws an ongoing cartoon about a simian astronaut named Apollo Ape.\n\nAt the CIA Headquarters, Victoria Lasseter (Connie Britton) is going through classified files when her former assistant Petey Douglas (Tony Hale) enters. She then gets a phone call from a disguised voice saying \"Tough Guy\" is moving in on \"Wise Man\". She confronts another agent, Adrian Yates (Topher Grace), as they both know this involves Mike and his association with a program that Victoria started, the Ultra Program. Yates wants Mike dead immediately, because he \"keeps trying to leave town,\" and orders Victoria to leave.\n\nMike and Phoebe are sharing a joint at a spot overlooking a street where they see a bunch of cop cars and a tow truck taking a car that crashed into a tree. A very stoned Mike talks about how the tree has just been standing there forever and only just did something by stopping the car. He starts crying because he thinks he's the tree and Phoebe is the car. She comforts him and says that's not the case.\n\nThe next day, Mike meets his buddy Rose (John Leguizamo) to get fireworks, as he wants to propose to Phoebe using them.\n\nLater that night at work, Victoria approaches Mike with a soup cup and a milk bottle, and she speaks in codes. He has no idea what she means, and she leaves frustrated. Mike goes outside to smoke a joint and eat the soup when he sees two guys putting something on the tires of his car. He calls to them, and they approach him with knives. Something in Mike goes off and he quickly reacts by throwing the hot soup in one guy's face before disarming both of them. He stabs the other guy in the neck with a spoon and then shoots both goons dead. Freaked out, he calls Phoebe at work. She rushes over and sees the dead men. They're then both arrested by the sheriff as he arrives on the scene.\n\nYates gets wind of what happened and knows that the codes Victoria said to Mike were meant to activate his skills. He orders two of his own agents, Crane (Monique Ganderton) and Laugher (Walton Goggins) to find Mike and Phoebe at the station, as well as a whole lockdown of the town. Crane opens fire and kills the officers while Laugher goes to kill Mike himself. Mike and Phoebe fight him and lock him in the cell. They run into Crane, who shoots at them, but they escape. The sheriff slows Crane down by cuffing her ankle to a metal chair before she executes him. Mike and Phoebe run, but Crane calls to Mike and throws him a grenade. He catches it and throws it back, blowing up the station and spilling Crane to the ground. He nods to Phoebe and walks over to Crane, and squares off with her. She throws a punch, but he grabs her wrist and breaks it, then slams Crane in the head before breaking her neck.\n\nMike and Phoebe head back to the store where Mike left his car. He freaks out again and they hug each other. The wind blows a bag onto Mike's car, setting off a bomb that the goons from earlier planted on the car.\n\nYates is brought to a truck full of sleeper agents, including Laugher, who survived the explosion at the station. Yates decides to use him and a few others to go after Mike.\n\nThe two take Phoebe's car to Rose's home where they can be protected. Rose is suspicious when he sees them because the news is making it seem like Mike contracted typhoid from Victoria, and that's why the town is on lockdown.\n\nMeanwhile, Victoria comes across the station and sees Crane's corpse sitting outside. She contacts Petey and asks for his help. He sends her a package containing guns and files on Crane and Laugher. Victoria realizes that Yates is using people with mental health problems as part of his program.\n\nYates calls Petey and tells him he knows about the supply package, and threatens to have him killed for treason.\n\nLooking over the files, Victoria talks to Petey, who now says he can't help her because he's been told she is committing treason.\n\nA few sleeper agents sneak around Rose's home and spread a poisonous gas through the vents. Another agent breaks in and kills Rose and his two buddies while Mike and Phoebe are in the next room. Phoebe tries escaping through the ceiling but falls through as one agent attacks Mike. Mike is exposed to the gas but he rips the mask off the agent, which Phoebe takes. Mike bashes the agent's head in with a weight and slowly slips out of consciousness.\n\nPhoebe grabs Mike and takes him outside. She kills the agent that let the gas in and takes an antidote from him, then injects it into Mike. He feels sleepy but Phoebe warns him that he will die if he slips away. Mike then sees flashes of nothing but his time with Phoebe as she pleads with him to wake up. He pukes and is okay but asks Phoebe how she knew what the gas was. She then admits that she is CIA and has been his handler for the last five years. Betrayed, Mike retreats to her car. She runs there with him, and the car is then hit by Laugher, driving in a larger vehicle. The car falls over a bridge. Laugher grabs Phoebe and pours gas all over the car. Victoria shows up and gets Mike out before Laugher lights it up and makes the car explode. He takes Phoebe back to Yates.\n\nVictoria takes Mike somewhere safe and tells him that he volunteered at a young age for the Ultra program after getting in and out of trouble a number of times. He was the only successful volunteer, but the program was discontinued after it was discovered it was starting to drive Mike insane. She erased his memories and gave him phobias to prevent him from leaving home (the order to kill him was because he tried to leave town to go to Hawaii). They return to Mike's house where he says he would rather die stoned and smiling in bed. Victoria explains to Mike that Phoebe watched over him during his training and always believed in him. She was only supposed to stay long enough so that Mike was settled in Liman, then return to CIA headquarters for debriefing and go on to her next assignment, but she fell so deeply in love with Mike that she gave everything up to stay with him.\n\nThree more agents arrive and shoot at Mike. At the same time, Yates orders Petey to send out a drone to blow up Mike's home, even at the cost of some of his own agents. Victoria kills one using a teddy bear as a silencer. Mike kills another and then finishes the last by bouncing a bullet off a frying pan. Petey cancels the drone strike to spite Yates. He then calls Yates and Victoria's superior, Raymond Krueger (the man watching Mike at the beginning).\n\nYates gets in touch with Mike, who arranges to get Phoebe back at a nearby supermarket. When Yates lets Phoebe talk to Mike to show she's alive and that Yates has her, she tells him that she was the tree all along, and he was the car. But Mike resolves to get her back.\n\nAt the supermarket, Yates brings Phoebe with a team of assassins. Mike uses the fireworks as he makes his entrance, driving through the store. He takes on all the assassins, killing them with whatever he can get his hands on in the store (a meat cleaver and hammer, for instance). He is left to face Laugher while Yates takes Phoebe with him. She uncuffs herself with a paper clip and punches Yates in the face. He hits her back and yells at her about how Mike will be killed, but she just smiles and flips him off. Victoria then catches Yates and nearly strangles him to death with a cable until Krueger arrives and stops her. Mike almost finishes off Laugher until he slumps over and apologizes, saying he can't control what he does, and that Mike is a better agent than him. Mike lets Laugher go.\n\nMike finds Phoebe and they walk outside together to face SWAT teams and other armed troopers. Mike takes this opportunity to propose to Phoebe. She says yes, but the moment is killed when both of them get tasered.\n\nKrueger takes both Yates and Victoria into the woods and reprimands them for letting all the deaths happen as a result of getting Mike activated, including seven civilians; a severe violation. Yates admits to acting without authorization, but insists he took initiative on a program already in place and that Krueger would be thanking him if it was a success. Krueger admits Yates is right about this, but then he shoots and kills him. A frightened Victoria begs for her life, but Krueger coldly tells her she needs to come up with a miracle. Victoria says she already has one: Mike killed 17 \"toughguy\" assets by himself, proving that Mike is a very valuable asset worth keeping alive.\n\nWe return to the first scene where Krueger is watching Mike get debriefed.\n\nSix months later.\n\nMike and Phoebe are in the Philippines on what appears to be a romantic getaway. Mike leaves Phoebe at the front desk, and she looks into a camera where Victoria and Petey are watching them. Mike gets into an elevator and is taken by two Mandarin gangsters, as planned by Victoria. The main gangster threatens and taunts Mike, but Mike observes what he can get his hands on in the room and he springs into action...\n\nAs the closing credits begin, a montage of Apollo Ape animations show Mike wiping out all the gangsters and escaping the hotel with Phoebe, where they finally take that long-awaited Hawaiian getaway."

    "American Warships": "When a fleet of mysterious ships wage war against the Earth, only the crew of the USS Iowa, the last American battleship, can prevent global armageddon.\n\nThis is an excerpt from Dan's movie report, for the full review go to:\n\nAmerican Warships represents a technological leap for The Asylum, the CGI in this film is very good, by low budget standards of course, not distracting at all. I am basing this strictly on lower budget standards, as many asylum films and other lower budget films have much poorer often times wrenching 80s technology CGI.\n\nThe acting is acceptable, not going to win awards, but Mario Van Peebles (Capt. Winston), Carl Weathers (General McKraken), and Johanna Watts (LT Bradley) are solid in their portrayal of their respective characters.

    "Amsterdamned": "Opening from his point of view, a murderer looks around the city of Amsterdam at night through the canals the city is famous for. He sneaks into a Chinese restaurant's backdoor and steals a butcher knife while the cooks weren't looking. The killer finds his first victim in a local prostitute, who after refusing advances from a cab driver, gets thrown out of the cab. A baglady watches from a distance as the killer plunges the knife into the hooker and drags her back into the water. The next morning, a tour boat on the canal collides with the body of the prostitute, who has been hung on one of the small bridges. As the tourists scream, the body drags on the top of the boat until an opening shows her bloodied body and face.\n\nAssigned to the case is detective Eric Visser, a hard-boiled detective who is raising his 13-year old daughter Anneke after a split from his ex. He spends an hour in a bath, comes home late from work, and tends to drink now and again. Nevertheless, Eric is praised as one of the best detectives on the force. His partner, Vermeer, meets Eric at the site where the body was found with fellow cop Potter attempting to get through to the baglady, who tells Eric that it was a monster who killed the prostitute and that it came out of the water.\n\nThat night, two environmentalists are taking water samples in an ongoing investigation against a nearby chemical plant. However, when the killer emerges, one of the men is taken underwater and when his partner attempts to grab the anchor, he is horrified to find the man's head on the anchor. Scared, the surviving environmentalist swims to the nearby shore and calls for help when he sees a truck pass by. As the truck driver comes out from a distance, the killer grabs the environmentalist and drags him back into the water.\n\nWhen Eric and Vermeer see the bodies of the environmentalists, he is convinced that there is a serial killer. Eric runs into John, an old friend from the police academy. John works for the river police and we learn that Eric's ex-girlfriend used to date John before Eric stole her from him. When John asks about what happened, John and Eric renew their friendship and are now partners on the case to find the killer.\n\nDuring a search at a local sporting club, Eric meets Laura, a museum guide as well as Martin Ruysdael, a former diver turned psychiatrist and Laura's doctor/friend. Eric begins to have eyes for Laura and she begins to like him too. Meanwhile, that night, a salvationist and a young woman on a gumboat the next day are the next victims of the killer. As Eric begins to get frustrated with nothing turning up, he and John eventually think they find a suspect in a former chemical plant employee known for his violent outbursts. When the suspect is caught, Eric begins to have doubts. When he sees Laura that night, a skipper at the nearby dock is the killer's next victim with the boat sinking.\n\nJohn decides to go underwater and investigate the next day. At first, he finds the skipper's body but as he approaches out of the skipper's sunken boat, the killer emerges and a tussle leaves John slashed and killed. Eric arrives to hear the bad news about John. When the killer is locate at a marina, a speedboat chase ensues between Eric and the killer. Eric eventually tracks the killer to a local sewer only to be shot at close range in the shoulder with a harpoon gun. When the killer attempts a coup de gr\u00e2ce, Eric shoots the mask before waking up in the hospital.\n\nWhen Laura goes to her appointment and finds Martin isn't home, she stays but hears a noise in Martin's underwater basement. She finds the broken mask and thinks Martin is the killer. An attempt to call Eric fails when he is still unconscious. When he awakens, the nurse tells him of Laura and both he and Vermeer head to Martin's house. Martin arrives and waits for Laura only to hear a sound in his basement. Laura confronts him and hits him repeatedly with an oar. However, the killer comes out of the water and grabs Laura. Eric arrives in time and shoots the killer. Martin finally confesses that the killer is a childhood friend of his and fellow diver who was shunned by society after a job at a chemical company caused him to be disfigured by uranium hexafluoride poisoning. The killer arrives to his home, where he reveals himself and decides to take his own life before the police arrive."

    "An Action Hero": "The film starts showing some R.A.W. officers entering an investigation room, where they find a handcuffed Maanav exercising. As they enquire about \"Katkar\", Maanav mentions Vicky and Bhoora Solanki, as the film goes into a flashback. Maanav is a popular actor, known as a leading man in action films. For his upcoming film, he heads to Mandothi in Haryana. Vicky Solanki, an aspiring strongman politician, who is currently contesting the local elections, wants to meet Maanav in order to gain an upper hand. Maanav does not pay heed, however, because of his busy shooting schedule. Just when he is about to meet Vicky, he is distracted by the delivery of his new Ford Mustang and goes for a long drive. However, an enraged Vicky follows and manhandles him. Maanav gets enraged, and pushes Vicky, who lands on a stone and gets hit in the head and neck. He dies on the spot.\n\nFrightened, Maanav escapes from the village and flees to the UK. He does not realize that Vicky's brother, Bhoora Solanki, a municipal councilor of Mandothi, has also reached the UK to hunt him down. His Mustang's side mirror is found in the crime scene, in Haryana, and the police soon conclude Maanav's role in Vicky's murder. Maanav's reputation is degraded and his films are boycotted. The news has already reached UK, and Maanav is forced to hide himself from the UK police. While returning from the market, Maanav finds Bhoora at his house; Bhoora has already killed two British officers, but Maanav manages to escape and tries to seek help from his lawyer, who does not respond. Bhoora confronts Maanav, who tries to prove his innocence, but Bhoora does not listen and tries to kill him. Maanav manages to not only overpower him, but also escape by locking him up in the car's trunk.\n\nUpon pressuring his manager for help, Maanav finally gets to meet a lawyer and fixer, but Bhoora arrives and kills him too. When he tries to kill Maanav, he is intercepted by Kaadir. Maanav flees again with Kaadir's help, but leaves him behind. Bhoora manages to learn where Maanav would be taken, and he holds Kaadir hostage. Meanwhile, Maanav gets fed up of hiding, and surrenders himself to the police with evidence of Bhoora killing the two British police officers in his house. Masood Abraham Katkar, a feared don who was taunted by Maanav as irrelevant, abducts him. Maanav is taken to a function hosted by Katkar where he has to perform in exchange for freedom.\n\nBhoora, after killing Kaadir in the parking lot of the building where the function is held , arrives and disrupts the function. He then gets caught by Katkar's men. After an interrogation, Katkar indirectly advises Bhoora to kill Maanav. His image with Katkar becomes viral on social media, just as Bhoora is about to shoot Maanav. Katkar dies in the process, and shortly thereafter, his men arrive to kill them both and a gun fight ensues. Maanav and Bhoora manage to defeat Katkar's men. Maanav formulates a plan to make a deal with the Indian Embassy to project a story that the government used Maanav's situation and assigned him for the mission to track and kill Katkar, thus saving him from imprisonment. Bhoora refuses to spare him out of ego, despite being aware of his innocence from the beginning, and wants to kill him. With no choice, Maanav kills Bhoora and his plan becomes successful. He regains his reputation and returns to India, where he is surrounded by his fans for an autograph session."

    "Angel": "The movie opens with 15 year-old honor student Molly Stewart (Donna Wilkes) attending her private prep school in the Los Angeles area. When she gets home, however, with some makeup work and a change in wardrobe she becomes Angel: the mini-skirted, high-heeled street prostitute working Hollywood Blvd. As she weaves her way through the evening avoiding vice-cops and interacting with potential customers, we meet the members of her street family: the aging movie cowboy Kit Carson (Rory Calhoun), street performer Yoyo Charlie (Steven M. Porter) transvestite Mae (Dick Shawn) and fellow hookers Crystal (Donna McDaniel) and Lana (Graem McGavin).\n\nDespite the carnival-like atmosphere of the Hollywood streets after dark, all is not well as hookers are being killed by a psycho-necrophiliac (John Diehl) that likes to dismember the girl's bodies when he is done. Police Lt. Andrews (Cliff Gorman) has been assigned to the case, but has no leads. Tragedy strikes Angel's group of friends when Crystal, who has a budding romantic relationship going with Yoyo Charlie, picks up the killer and winds up a victim.\n\nThe next day at school the arrogant jock Ric Sawyer (David Underwood) makes a play for Molly which she pointedly rejects. She then goes to see teacher Patricia Allen (Elaine Giftos) who is concerned about Molly's lack of extra-curricular activities. Molly explains that her mother has been paralyzed by a stroke and she needs to go home immediately after school every day to take care of her.\n\nThe next evening a crowd, including Angel, gathers outside the motel room where Crystal's body was found. Lt. Andrews advises the girls to work in pairs. Later that evening Angel is working with partner Lana when they see a potential client across the street. Lana takes him to a motel room she and Angel share. A couple hours later when Angel shows up at the room with a client of her own, she finds the naked, bloody body of Lana in the shower where the killer left it.\n\nThis makes Angel the only person who can identify the killer. Based on a description she gives the police, a sketch is made and the killer is brought in for a lineup. Angel recognizes him, but he escapes by grabbing an officer's gun and shooting his way out of the police station.\n\nAndews takes Molly/Angel home and demands to speak with her parents, then finds out the truth: Molly's father left her mother nine years ago and her mom abandoned Molly three years ago. Molly keeps up the fiction of her mother being around so that she will not be sent to a foster home. She believes someday her father will return for her and wants to be waiting for him at their old apartment, so since the age of 12 she has paid the rent by prostitution.\n\nDespite Andrews' warnings to stay off the street, Angel/Molly purchases a small pistol and goes back to work. That night schoolmate Ric Sawyer and pals see her on a street corner and force her into their car, but Molly uses the gun to escape. However, her secret is out now and her whole school knows she spends her evenings as a Hollywood hooker.\n\nThe next day, Mae is playing cards with Molly's ill-tempered landlord, Solly (Susan Tyrrell), when teacher Allen, who has heard the stories circulating around the school, comes by insisting on seeing Molly's mother. Mae sneaks up to Molly's apartment to try and pretend he is Molly's mother, but Allen sees through this subterfuge. Mae is still at Molly's apartment a few minutes later when the killer, trying to murder Molly, shows up. He and Mae fight till Mae is stabbed. After the killer flees, Mae is still alive long enough where he dies in Solly's arms.\n\nAndrews and Molly return to her apartment to find Mae dead. While Andrews is on the phone to call for backup, Molly goes to Solly's room and gets her gun (a huge, long-barreled .44 magnum) and heads out on the streets to avenge Mae. Andrews goes looking for her and enlists Kit Carson to help in the search. The killer, dressed up as a Hara Krishna, sneaks up behind Molly with a knife, but a warning from Yoyo Charlie saves her and starts a chase though the streets with Molly using the huge gun to blast away at the killer while Andrews ties to catch up with them both. In a dead-end alley the killer jumps Molly and gets her gun and is about to turn it on both her and Andrews when Carson - having put real bullets into his cowboy/show guns - arrives just in the nick of time to fill the killer full of lead. Molly, Andrews and a wounded Carson walk off together as the scene fades to black."

    "Angel Has Fallen": "Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) undergoes training at a private military facility owned by his friend Wade Jennings (Danny Huston), a former fellow Army Ranger who is currently the CEO of the paramilitary company Salient Global, and is recommended for the position of Secret Service Director by the President of the United States, Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman), to replace retiring Director David Gentry (Lance Reddick). Banning hides the fact that he is suffering from migraines and insomnia with regular visits to several doctors, and begins taking medication to cope with recurring back pain.\n\nWhile the President is on a rural fishing trip, armed drones attack his protection detail, with only Banning surviving and saving the President; both are incapacitated, with Trumbull in a coma. FBI Agent Helen Thompson (Jada Pinkett Smith) finds substantial evidence that Banning may be responsible for the attack, with the van used to carry out the attack containing Banning's hair and DNA & $10 MM transferred into his accounts mysteriously from a state owned bank in Moscow. Banning is subsequently arrested.\n\nEn route to a detention facility, Banning and his transport are ambushed. He escapes after killing the assailants, revealed to be agents who took part in his training exercise; Banning realizes that Jennings has betrayed and framed him. Banning calls his wife Leah (Piper Perabo), letting her know he is alive. The call alerts Thompson to Banning's location, leading to a car chase. However, Banning escapes again before heading to his father's home in the woods.\n\nWith Trumbull still comatose, Vice President Martin Kirby (Tim Blake Nelson) is sworn in as Acting President. Via surveillance cameras, Banning and his father Clay (Nick Nolte) observe Jennings' men approaching the house; Clay detonates explosives around the perimeter, killing the would-be attackers as he and Banning escape, and Banning reveals to his father that he has a wife and daughter. Leah and her daughter are on the verge of being kidnapped by Jennings' men when Clay saves them. Kirby reveals to the press that Banning is responsible for the assassination attempt with support from the Russian government.\n\nFinding the bodies around Clay's cabin, Thompson deduces that Banning was set up. Trumbull awakens from his coma, and Kirby is revealed to be involved with Jennings. Kirby plans to retaliate for the President's \"attempted assassination\" by attacking Russia. Thompson and another agent meet Jennings, who kills them both.\n\nBanning reaches Trumbull's hospital and is captured, but Trumbull orders his release. Banning leads Trumbull to safety with help from Gentry and other loyal agents, as Jennings destroys the hospital's Intensive Care Unit by increasing the oxygen and nitrogen supply to unstable levels, causing an explosion. Banning hides Trumbull and Gentry as Jennings' men pursue them. After a long gun battle, Jennings attempts to escape via helicopter, which Banning destroys. They face off hand-to-hand, and Banning mortally stabs Jennings. Banning is exonerated while Trumbull and Gentry arrest Kirby for treason due to the evidence uncovered by Jennings to deploy as an insurance policy.\n\nClay decides to live with Banning and his family. Feeling guilty over his failure to protect Trumbull, as well as his undisclosed ailments, Banning offers his resignation, but Trumbull forgives his mistakes and offers Banning the promotion to Director of the Secret Service, which he accepts."

    "Angel and the Badman": "A man on horseback is being chased by gunmen who shoot at him. He outruns them, and races across gorgeous scenery in an arid landscape. Quirt Evans (John Wayne) falls from his faltering horse.\n\nA beautiful girl Penelope Worth (Gail Russell) and her father Thomas Worth (John Halloran) see him fall and approach to rescue him, as he is wounded.\n\nBefore accepting attention to his wound, Quirt insists on going to the telegraph office, where he sends a telegram to claim some land and have it recorded in his name. When he gives his name, the town telegrapher Bradley (Olin Howland) recognizes him as a notorious gunfighter. Quirt loses consciousness and falls into Penelope's arms.\n\nPenelope and her father take Quirt to their home and send for the doctor.\n\nDr. Mangram (Tom Powers) gives Quirt laudanum to anesthetize him, but Quirt remains very restless while unconscious, until the father realizes he is instinctively reaching for his gun. After the gun is emptied of bullets, it is put in Quirt's hand and that relaxes him so the bullet is extracted and his wound is cleaned and bandaged.\n\nDr.. Mangram is a pragmatic atheist who immediately recommends that the family should get Quirt out of their house, but the family refuses because it is their duty as Quakers to tend to the wounded man.\n\nQuirt sleeps in bed for two whole days. While Penelope watches over him, he talks in his sleep about gunfights and women, especially one named Lila.\n\nIn the kitchen, Penelope asks her mother (Irene Rich) about how she met her father, and how they fell in love.\n\nWhen Quirt wakes, and hears a noise, he gropes for his gun, which is under the pillow and rises, gun in hand to face a startled Penelope.\n\nQuirt's earlier lifestyle of fast draws, fast women, booze, bar fights, and so on doesn't bother the family as they believe there is good that can be nurtured in every person.\n\nQuirt gets stronger and relishes the mother's sausages, eggs, donuts and cakes that melt in your mouth.\n\nIn town, telegrapher Bradley brags about having a long friendship with Quirt, because Quirt is notorious and feared by everyone in the territory, though he only saw him once when he sent off the telegram.\n\nLaredo Stevens (Bruce Cabot) and two henchmen, the gang who had shot Quirt a few days back, come looking for him, question Bradley, and eventually approach the Quaker home.\n\nWhen Quirt is aware of Laredo's presence outside the house, he jumps out of bed and dresses and gets his gun but it has no bullets, as Mr. Worth had emptied it. Talking tough, he bluffs, holding the gang off with his unloaded gun. Laredo wants the land Quirt had secured, and Quirt agrees to sell for twenty thousand dollars and signs a deed. Laredo hands over five thousand, promising to give the rest of the money later when Quirt comes over to collect.\n\nQuirt is respectful of the Quaker family's ways, he hangs his holstered gun outside, never allowing it inside. Exposure to the ways of the Quakers starts to change not only gunfighter Quirt but also the cynical, atheistic doctor who attends to him, grumbling all the time.\n\nWhen Quirt is able, he helps the family in their farm work, and is very grateful for their loving care.\n\nFor Penelope, it has been virtually love at first sight. Quirt develops feelings for her as they chat about each other, farm work, and Quaker beliefs.\n\nIn little time, Quirt kisses her, and she reacts ecstatically.\n\nThey are interrupted by territorial Marshal Wistful McClintock (Harry Carey) who questions Quirt about his recent whereabouts. Penelope's statement that he hasn't been outside the farm for days is totally believed, but the marshal warns about his habits and promises he will be watching closely.\n\nQuirts romantic feelings can't help but increase.\n\nAt one point Penelope confesses her love for Quirt, and is surprised he doesn't feel the same: \"I never thought it could happen to one and not another.\" Her outright innocence is incredibly touching and endearing, and affects Quirt deeply.\n\nQuirt doesn't want to let the love take over because of the life that he leads and because he will be out looking for revenge on the people who shot him. The tug of his old ways is still strong.\n\nQuirt's reputation as a gunslinger comes in very handy in settling a dispute with a neighbor who has diverted water that used to flow toward the Quaker settlement. Neighbor Frederick Carson (Paul Hurst) is convinced by Quirt by the power of his menacing reputation, to \"be a good neighbor\" and remove the top two boards holding back water that used to flow into flumes and irrigation ditches.\n\nNevertheless it is the genuine and uncritical welcome the old man subsequently receives from the Worths that converts him from obnoxious neighbor into friend. As Carson is happily taking home a basket of pies and donuts from Mrs. Worth, he remarks to the as yet vacillating Quirt, about how good helping his neighbors makes him feel.\n\nAs Quirt stays with the family longer, their life becomes more attractive to him.\n\nOn the way to a surprise arranged for him at a [Quaker] meeting, Quirt is seen by the passing Randy McCall (Lee Dixon), who is an old friend and former partner in crime. Randy reverses course and goes along.\n\nAt the meeting, the Quaker group thanks Quirt publicly for solving the water problem, and is given a Bible. Randy is impressed, then enthralled by the Bible given to Quirt, and takes to reading it out loud at any opportunity.\n\nDuring the gathering, the young and handsome local blacksmith approaches Penelope and his interest in courting and marrying her is obvious. Quirt becomes jealous but isn't ready to take responsibilities.\n\nRandy takes Quirt aside after the ceremony and tells him that he knows that Laredo is planning to rustle a large herd as it is driven through a nearby valley the next day.\n\nQuirt, overwhelmed by the Quakers' gratitude, and convinced that he isn't good for Penelope, takes the opportunity to get away and try a return to his old life. He takes the blacksmith aside and tells him to quit stalling and marry Penelope, and immediately departs with Randy.\n\nThe Laredo gang's attempt to rustle the herd is foiled by Quirt and Randy and another friend. First there are galloping horses, guns blazing, falls from horses, and a stampede, as Laredo attacks, but then Quirts gang comes from behind and one by one picks off the rustlers by using long wooden clubs.\n\nNext we see Randy and Quirt drinking at a saloon and casino in Red Rock, where Lila (Joan Barton) is entertaining with her singing. Quirt is no longer the old Quirt. He gambles and wins a pile of chips that he gives to Lila as a goodbye present in honor of their old relationship. Then he picks a fight with a group drinking at the bar by rudely pushing them aside and yelling \"More Whiskey!\" to start a massive saloon brawl.\n\nHe makes it back to the Worth farm and wants to resume with Penelope.\n\nMcClintock is not convinced of his desire to reform. He remarks \"I'm patient, that's what hangs all you fellas in the end, I'm patient\", although his regard for Quirts reputation is almost respectful: \"You know Quirt, I always figured on usin' a new rope in hangin' you\". McClintock keeps dropping by to see Quirt and to interrogate him, reminding Quirt that he is going to enjoy hanging him and is waiting for a showdown with Laredo so that he can \"... hang the winner\".\n\nLater, when he takes Penelope on a buckboard wagon to pick blackberries, Quirt leaves his gun behind in deference to her wishes. The scene where the two pick blackberries is a romantic idyll, which ends abruptly when Laredo and his gang spot them from a distance and menacingly approach in galloping horses.\n\nOutnumbered, without a gun, and with Penelope at his side, there is no option but to run, and there follows a thrilling chase of a wagon on a road being pursued by men on horseback. Quirt maneuvers and takes jumps and steep and narrow paths, one man collides with a tree branch, but eventually his wagon runs off a ledge and falls from a great height into a deep narrow river.\n\nQuirt manages to swim to hide below the rocks, pulling an unconscious Penelope with him. Laredo looks upon the scene from a height a few moments later, and assumes Quirt has drowned.\n\nLater, Quirt walks into the Worth farm carrying the unconscious Penelope in his arms, and the doctor is called. The prognosis is bad, the skeptical doctor takes up his sermonizing as to how dangerous Quirt is to those around him, and how frustrating his profession is, that he works to patch up people who keep on doing dangerous things and being hurt again and again.\n\nQuirt, who believes he is losing the great love of his life, wants revenge, and goes into town to face Laredo when he is told Laredo is in the saloon.\n\nHe enters one end of town, walking alone, the townspeople scatter. Laredo is shocked to be told Quirt is at the other end of town, inviting him to come out. First he sends one of his henchmen to peek out to verify. Then, he decides to take another swig of a whisky bottle, and waits.\n\nMeantime, Penelope has recovered consciousness, and, weak as she is, demands to be driven to town in the wagon, lying down.\n\nThe Worth wagon arrives on the scene. Penelope insists on trying to talk Quirt out of violence. Quirt turns his back to the saloon to talk to her, just as Laredo emerges. In part to protect Penelope who would be in the line of fire, Quirt drops his gun and turns to face Laredo weaponless.\n\nIt might have been a sad finale, were it not for the vigilant McClintock, who has his rifle pointed at Laredo from a distance, and shoots as he sees Laredo reach for his gun.\n\nSo the bad guys die by causes that are natural to them, namely bullets, but Quirt doesn't do the shooting.\n\nAs Quirt departs on his way home with the Worths, the Marshal picks up Quirt's gun and announces he will hang it in his office along with a new rope, in memory of the adversary who never was."

Vijay talks to Karthik about marrying Geetanjali.\n\nVijay gets into an argument with Reet's husband Varun (Siddhant Karnick), prompting Balbir to expel him once again from the household. It was Balbir's 60th Birthday and Varun had invited the CM to the party. Varun wanted Vijay to pay his respects to the CM, which Vijay refused to do. When Varun confronts Vijay, Vijay retorts that Varun has no clue about how to maintain the respect of the business and the family as he keeps bowing to gutless politicians. Vijay calls Varun a monkey. Vijay sees Roop making eyes at Varun's younger brother and warns her to break it off.\n\nVijay is leaving the house, when Karthik brings Geetanjali to him, as she refused to marry her fiance and has been kicked out of her house. Vijay takes Geetanjali to meet Balbir, but Balbir gives him an extremely cold shoulder. Geetanjali's parents Shreepad (Mathew Varghese) and Motika (Indira Krishnan) also object to their proposed marriage. Vijay marries his childhood love Geetanjali (Rashmika Mandanna), and the couple cuts off their families and moves to the USA.\n\nEight years later, Vijay, Geetanjali, and their two kids fly back to India when Balbir is shot by assassins. Balbir survives the assassination attempt, but Varun treats Vijay very badly upon his return to the house. Upon reconciling with his family, Vijay takes it upon himself to uncover the assassin's identity; he rounds up his cousins from Dalbir's family (Sangram (Davy Grewal), Paali (Vivek Sharma), Sunny (Gagandeep Singh), Vikram (Kawalpreet Singh), Guru (Amanjot Singh), Rajbir (Manjot Singh), Manjot (Avdeep Sindhu), Balli (Kamaljeet Rana), Kirpal (Gursewak Singh Mander), Butta (Butta Badbar)) from the village for backup (as he cannot trust the body guards surrounding his father anymore). Dalbir agrees to help Vijay and considers him courageous for trying to overcome the rift between the 2 families and trying to bring them together.\n\nVijay recruits a body double for his father, who is eventually killed by Asrar Haque (Babloo Prithiveeraj), the assassin. Vijay discovers Varun's role in the assassination attempt and murders him publicly at a conference where Asrar is also present. Mishra tracks Varun's phone and tells Vijay that Varun was in direct contact with Asrar. Later, Vijay meets an arms dealer Freddy Wilfred Patil (Upendra Limaye) at a hotel, where hundreds of assailants, headed by Asrar, attack. Freddy had made special arms, including a monster machine gun for Vijay, which helps the brothers to fight Asrar and his army. Vijay takes them all down and kills Asrar but is severely wounded and is bedridden for two weeks. He recovers in two weeks but undergoes a heart transplant for his failing heart. While killing Asrar, Vijay knew that Asrar was backed by his brother and Vijay vows revenge against him. But Vijay did not know the identity of Asrar and his brothers.\n\nBalbir wants the cousins to leave but Vijay overrules Balbir and says that they are not out of danger yet. Vijay tells Reet that he killed Varun. Geetanjali admits to Vijay that she is scared of Vijay and does not know when he will stop.\n\nAbrar is married to his third wife Umm-E-Hani Fareen (Mansi Taxak). He has 8 kids from his first 2 wives Niloofar (Shabana Haroon) and Mehrunnisa (Safina Shah). Abrar is Asrar's brother and receives news that Asrar is dead trying to kill Vijay. Abrar is equally ruthless and cruel as Vijay. Abid is Abrar's younger brother.\n\nVijay recuperates after several months and is approached by Zoya (Triptii Dimri), the fiance of his heart donor. Vijay starts an affair with Zoya. Zoya reveals that she was sent by Asrar's brother Abrar Haque (Bobby Deol) to honey trap him. Vijay, however, had always known this and acted along to learn the mastermind's identity. Zoya tells Vijay that Abrar's plan was to surgically alter the face of his younger brother Aziz to look like Vijay. This way the fake Vijay would enter Vijay's house and kill Balbir. Balbir would have died thinking that Vijay killed him, and this way the real Vijay would be cursed to eternal damnation.\n\nVijay lets Zoya go and learns from his grandfather Rajdheer Singh that Abrar and his brothers (Abrar, Asrar, Abid, Aziz) are Vijay's second cousins; they are Rajdheer's younger brother Shamsher's grandchildren.\n\nRajdheer had renounced Shamsher for his immoral antics; years later, Shamsher's son, Azim, who had converted to Islam, was denied any share in Balbir's assets, prompting Shamsher to commit suicide. Abrar, who had witnessed his grandfather's suicide, became mute from the trauma. Abrar has relocated to Scotland and has been the one plotting against Balbir to seek vengeance for his family. Vijay comes clean to Geetanjali about sleeping with Zoya and she is livid. Vijay says that he did not wear a condom and refuses to kill Zoya as he learned about the murderer from her. He claims that he did everything for Balbir. Geetanjali says that Balbir is a disease in Vijay's life and wished that he had died when he was attacked. Vijay and Geetanjali eventually reconcile and have sex.\n\nVijay and his cousins travel to Scotland and stop Abrar as he is about to escape the country in a private jet with his other brother Abid (Saurabh Sachdeva). A violent duel ensues on the runway, ending in Vijay killing Abrar. Fareen gives birth to twin boys. Back home during Diwali, Balbir reveals his terminal illness to Vijay and realizes that his lack of love for his son has always been the root cause of Vijay's aggression. Finally, Balbir apologizes to Vijay and the two reconcile. However, Geetanjali decides to leave him, but it is not clear if their son, Abhay, stays with him or not.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Aziz (Ranbir Kapoor), the youngest of the Haque brothers, and an infamous assassin in Istanbul, undergoes plastic surgery to resemble Vijay. Zoya is with him, revealed to be pregnant, though unsure whether the child is Aziz' or Vijay's. Aziz sets out with Abid to exact retaliation for the deaths of their two elder brothers."

    "Anjaan": "A handicapped man named Krishna arrives from Kanyakumari to Mumbai, in order to look for his brother Raju, who is revealed to be a gangster when Krishna meets Raju's friends Rajiv and Karim Bhai. A flashback unfolds when Karim starts telling Krishna about Raju and his brother-like friend Chandru who ruled Mumbai as feared gangsters. One day, the arrival of a new commissioner gave them hard time, and in order to free their henchmen, Raju kidnapped the commissioner's daughter Jeeva on the night of her wedding. The commissioner is forced to release the henchmen, but Jeeva reveals she didn't want to marry and got kidnapped with her consent. Soon, Raju and Jeeva fall for each other. Later, Raju and Chandru try to impress a more powerful don named Imran, who insults and warns them instead. Seeing Chandru enraged, Raju kidnaps Imran and the duo avenge their insult by returning Imran's words to him. Delighted, Chandru gifts Raju with a car and a one-week vacation with Jeeva. During the vacation, Raju and Jeeva are attacked but flee the shootout. Raju later finds Chandru's corpse and orders his henchman Amar to take him to Imran. Amar stops the vehicle near a bridge, retrieves Raju's gun and shoots him as he falls into water. Back to present, Karim sees Amar beat up a worker for not giving him a car he wanted to use for illegal gains. When Krishna is spotted, Amar orders his henchmen to kill him but Krishna surprises them when he is revealed to Raju himself. He fights off everyone, kills Amar and tells Karim he'd remain Krishna unless his mission to hunt down all traitors ends. He seeks refuge at Karim's house and learns from him that Chandru and others were to meet a powerful criminal JK on the day Chandru was killed. Jackie was the only henchman who didn't tag along. Raju finds Jackie, chases and attacks him, before Jackie reveals he tried to contact Raju who was then on vacation, and Chadru whose phone was answered by Johnny. Fearing something bad, Jackie ran away. Using Johnny's prostitute girlfriend, Raju nabs Johnny and makes him confess the truth: Instead of JK, Imran and his henchmen arrived at the rendezvous. Chandru fought them off but was betrayed by Johnny, Amar and Manoj, and stabbed to death by Imran. Raju had called on Chandru's phone during this but was answered by Amar who lied about Chandru being in a meeting, before Chandru kicked the phone away. Learning the truth, Raju shoots Johnny in front of Jackie, and then goes to kill Manoj, a now powerful businessman as well as gangster, by entering his office, first pretending to be Krishna and then tricking everyone into believing Raju is on the way. Raju fights off the henchmen and kills Manoj. Raju tries to kill Imran at his birthday party, but ends up shooting a virtual projection telecast from Dubai. Imran's henchmen vandalize Karim's house and kidnap a girl named Saira, who is revealed to be none other Jeeva; she wanted to secretly keep in touch with Raju until his mission was accomplished, and even took care of him. Learning this, Raju goes to the spot and fights off the henchmen, rescuing Jeeva but himself getting captured by Imran's top henchmen. Imran, who has arrived in India, tries to kill Raju who exacts his revenge by getting Imran betrayed by his own top henchmen. Having turned the henchmen with a promise to rule Mumbai together, Raju kills first Imran and then the henchmen, believing his enemies must not have traitors either. Before departing from Mumbai, Raju and Jeeva meet the taxi driver Raja who helped Raju believing him to be Krishna, and is now shocked to realize it was Raju all along."

She is forced to participate in stealing money from the credit cards of a kidnapped foreigner, which is resists, but is beaten up by Petyr. In a turning point of her life, she reluctantly accepts an offer by KGB officer Alex (Luke Evans) to serve the KGB for 5 yrs (she had applied to serve the Russian Navy, but is picked up by Alex due to her military pedigree (her dad also served in the Navy)\n\nAfter a year of training, she is to work as a KGB assassin for five years under a handler named Olga (Helen Mirren), after which she will be free to continue her life as she pleases. Olga is reluctant to take on Anna under her department as she thinks Anna is just a pretty face who can be used as a honey trap. But Anna impresses her with her knowledge and her ability to play chess. Olga assigns Anna to kill a Russian drug lord at his HQ in under 5 mins. Anna doesn't know that the gun provided to her is unloaded and the Drug lord is surrounded by his army of bodyguards. Anna fights through the entire contingent and finally kills her mark, but is later by over 1 minute. Olga classifies Anna as a failure, but agrees to try her out, when Anna refuses to act like a victim.\n\nKGB head Vassiliev (Eric Godon) is not willing to honor this agreement, implying that the only way out of the KGB is death. Olga convinces Vassiliev by saying that agents don't usually survive 5 yrs in her department. Vassiliev also doubts Anna as KGB has no leverage on her. She has no ties in Russia.\n\nShe goes undercover as a fashion model and is hired to work in Paris. Olga and her team coordinate to ensure that the Agency's scouting agent \"finds\" Anna at a Russian vegetable market when he is looking for talent in Moscow. Anna is shifted to Paris, where she takes on a lesbian lover Maud (Lera Abova), whom she uses as a cover during her assignments.

Miller tells Anna how he was the head of CIA in Moscow when Vassilie killed 9 US agents in one day and hence they don't have any real assets in Russia now and need to rely on Anna. Anna kills Vassiliev and fights her way out of the KGB. She doesn't kill Alex but then doesn't meet miller at the rendezvous point either. Miller thinks Anna has gone rogue. She later arranges a meet with Alex and Miller, bartering information she stole from the two agencies in exchange for a six month reprieve. As she is leaving, she is ambushed by Olga and fatally shot for her betrayal. However, she uses a body double (Nastya Sten) to fake her death and escape.\n\nIt is revealed that Olga had earlier discovered Anna's association with the CIA and the planned assassination of Vassiliev. Both women conspired to go along with the CIA's plan so that Olga could succeed Vassiliev and later faked Anna's execution to fool both agencies and set Anna free.

    "Annaatthe": "Kaalaiyan (Rajinikanth) is a village president who only bows to goodness and moral fairness. These ideals lead him to clash with Nattadurai (Prakash Raj), a rival village leader who chooses to rule by fear. The 2 come face to face in a town police station over a dispute over land records. Kaalaiyan beats up Nattadurai's men in front of him.\n\nWhen Nattadurai tries to extort land from an old man, he hires Pattamal (Nayanthara), a lawyer, to defend his case. Kaalaiyan exposes the truth to her (That Nattadurai had only paid for part of the land and was now trying to swindle the whole land, without paying for it. That part of the land is where the old man's wife is buried and hence he is fighting for it), leading Pattamal to intentionally throw the case, After a few days, Pattammal and Kaalaiyaan fall in love. At a temple in a neighboring village, Nattadurai tries to attack Kaalaiyaan with some of his men, but they all get thrashed. Nattadurai joins the fight himself, but has a change of heart when Kaalaiyan refuses to attack him in front of Nattadurai's family (wife (Sriranjini)).\n\nKalaiyan's world revolves around his sister, Thanga Meenatchi (Keerthy Suresh), whom he had to raise himself after their parents died (Mother died in child birth of the sister, while dad died earlier). When she returns home after completing her education in the north, some members of their family feel that it's time to get Meenatchi married, and they convey the same to Kaalaiyaan. Unsure of the suggestion, he consults with his sister about the idea, and she tells him that it's his decision that matters the most to her.\n\nKaalaiyan initially has trouble finding a suitable groom. All the grooms are afraid of Kaalaiyan. At the same time Kaalaiyan's Cousin Sisters, Angayarkanni (Khushbu) (Idithangi (Pandiarajan), Angayarkanni's husband) and Mangaiyarkarasi (Meena) (Irulandi (Livingston), Mangayarkarasi's husband) wants to marry their brothers (Sathyaseelan (Sathish), Angayarkanni's brother, Mangayarkarasi's brother (Sathyan)) to marry Thanga Meenakshi. They both initially wanted to marry Kaalaiyan 10 yrs ago, But he didn't accept to marry them, as they were blood relations. Now the cousins want Kaalaiyan to decide which sister's brother he wants to marry Meenakshi to.. When Kaalaiyan is unsure, the cousin sisters offer to divorce their respective husbands and marry Kaalaiyan.\n\nAfter a lot of drama and understanding, they allow Thanga Meenakshi to marry anyone of Kaalaiyan's choice (after he pulls a godly chariot with hooks dug into his back, as penance for a better life for his sister). Finally he agrees to let Meenatchi marry Nattadurai's younger brother who is a doctor in a Govt hospital. The day of the wedding, Meenatchi goes missing, so Kaalaiyan dispatches men to search the entire countryside. They finally find Meenatchi on a train, trying to elope with a boy she met during her studies. Torn between his need to save his family's dignity and his love for his sister, Kaalaiyan finally allows Meenatchi to leave.\n\nAn understanding Nattadurai peacefully leaves, and Kaalaiyan staves off demands for an honor killing from relatives (Kaalaiyaan's grandmother (Kulappulli Leela), Kaalaiyan's uncle (Vela Ramamoorthy), Kaalaiyan's uncle (Piraisoodan)). Meenatchi shifts to Kolkata with her husband, where she loses contact with Kaalaiyan. Worrying about her well-being, Kaalaiyan and Pattamal travel to Kolkata to find her. Kaalaiyan accidentally eavesdrops on Meenatchi, when he finds out that she is having serious troubles and can't bring herself to contact her brother unless she is happy and financially secure.\n\nKaalaiyan secretly follows Meenatchi to a bar where she meets a gangster who loaned her money to tell him that she can't pay him yet. When the gangster tries to assault her, Kaalaiyan grows enraged and beats up the man and his men. He does not reveal himself to Meenatchi and keeps his presence a secret. Kaalaiyan has Meenatchi moved to Pattamal's apartment, where he can watch over her while he tries to fix her problems. Meenatchi is threatened by thugs watching her through the window and falls ill. When Pattamal leaves to get her medicine, the thugs attack her. Kaalaiyan rescues her and interrogates the attackers, learning the truth of what happened to Meenatchi.\n\nWhen she and her husband started business in Kolkata, they were approached by Manoj Parekar (Abhimanyu Singh), a wealthy businessman and underworld boss. Manoj tells them that he has forced many companies to let him purchase half of their shares to change his black money to white money, and that he wants to do the same to Meenatchi's company. Meenatchi's husband refuses, but Manoj warns Meenatchi that she will soon be pleading at his feet to sign over the shares. Over the following weeks, Meenatchi's company is destroyed: their factory catches fire, they are forced to shut down, and Meenatchi's husband is arrested under trumped-up charges, being tortured in police custody. Meenatchi falls at Manoj's feet and pleads him to get her husband released, signing over her company. Manoj agrees, but immediately backs down from his promise, saying that Meenatchi's husband will never be free again. Meenatchi tries to free him through legal means, but Manoj has everyone who agreed to help them murdered.\n\nHearing this story, Kaalaiyan swears to destroy Manoj Parekar. Going by the name Annaatthe, Kaalaiyan and some of his village friends storm Manoj's office and issue him an ultimatum: by the end of the week, Manoj will be dead. Manoj tries to find Annaatthe, but in vain. Annaatthe makes Manoj's life hell as he attacks him relentlessly, sets his business on fire, sets his personal Beemer on fire (with Manoj in it).. Manoj lands in the hospital.\n\nAnnaatthe tells Manoj and his gang members that unless they kill each other, Annaatthe will kill them himself. After escaping from his former subordinates, Manoj is cornered by Kaalaiyan, who forces him to sign his name on papers which says that he will return the companies he stole to their former owners. Kaalaiyan decides to spare Manoj's life, saying that death would be a mercy for him. Insulted, Manoj visits his estranged brother, Udhav Parekar (Jagapathi Babu), demanding that Udhav end \"Annaatthe\". After saying this, Manoj suicides. Udhav manages to track down Meenatchi (he sends men to all families who had their money returned to them. But Kaalaiyan saw the men coming and thrashed them. This was the only group who didn't report back to Udhav and that's how he tracks them down) and brings men to attack her, realizing that Annatthe would surely arrive to protect her. Pattamal and Meenatchi manage to evade the attackers for some time (with Kaalaiyan guiding Pattamal on phone from a high vantage point from where he surveys all proceedings), but are separated by a crowd. Kaalaiyaan arrives and clobbers all of Udhav's men and kills Udhav. He reveals himself to Meenatchi, who tearfully apologizes for all the trouble she put her brother through."

    "Anniyan": "Ramanujam Iyengar alias Ambi is an orthodox Brahmin and a straightforward consumer protection advocate living in Triplicane, Chennai. He expects everyone to follow the law and prosecutes those who violate it. However, his efforts fail as circumstantial evidence always seems to favor the accused. He also fails to raise civic awareness due to pervasive corruption and a general lack of seriousness. Frustrated at his inability to bring about a change in society, his suppressed anger manifests itself in an alter-ego named Anniyan, a grim reaper-themed serial killer who punishes corrupt and indifferent people. Anniyan creates a website, compiles a list of wrongdoers from his site, and kills them using punishments described in the Garuda Puranam, one of the ancient Hindu scriptures.\n\nAmbi is secretly in love with his neighbor Nandini, an aspiring carnatic singer, but never expresses his love due to his fear of rejection. When he proposes to her during the annual Tyagaraja Aradhana at Thiruvaiyaru, she rejects him as she cannot bear his strict adherence to rules. Distraught, Ambi attempts suicide, almost drowning himself before having second thoughts. Subsequently, he develops another personality named Remo, a fashion model. Nandini is smitten by Remo and falls in love with him. Their marriage is eventually fixed.\n\nWhile purchasing a plot of land for her dowry, Nandini decides to undervalue the property to evade stamp duty. Ambi, who accompanies her as she registered the property, refuses to help her. Later, when Nandini and Remo are on a date, Remo transforms into Anniyan and attempts to punish her for her corrupt act. As he is about to kill her, Nandini calls out for Ambi. Anniyan then reverts to Ambi, who collapses and loses consciousness. Nandini takes Ambi to NIMHANS where he is diagnosed with multiple personality disorder. Through recovered-memory therapy, Vijaykumar, the chief psychiatrist of the hospital uncovers Ambi's past. It is revealed that, when Ambi was fourteen years old, he witnessed the accidental death of his younger sister Vidya due to civic apathy. The incident left a deep emotional scar, which is the reason for his lofty ideals. It is also discovered that while Anniyan and Remo are aware of Ambi as a separate person, Ambi is oblivious to their existence within him. Vijaykumar declares that Remo will cease to exist if Nandini accepts Ambi's love, but Anniyan will cease to exist only when the society reforms. Nandini accepts Ambi's love and Remo disappears.\n\nMeanwhile, DCP Prabhakar and Sub-inspector Chari, who is Ambi's friend, investigate the murders committed by Anniyan. In disguises, they discover clues left behind by Anniyan, which are the names of the punishments he meted out to his victims. Prabhakar is determined to bring Anniyan to justice as one of Anniyan's victims, Chockalingam, an errant catering contractor with the Indian Railways, was his elder brother. In a dramatic publicity stunt, Anniyan admits to the murders he committed when he appears amidst the public and the press at the Nehru Stadium. He explains the rationale behind them and says that only when every Indian is responsible and sincere will the country prosper on a par with developed nations. His methods draw both praise and criticism. Prabhakar tries to catch Anniyan, but he escapes.\n\nOn investigating the recorded footage, Prabhakar discovers that Anniyan is Ambi and arrests him. Ambi is brutally interrogated and almost killed, triggering Anniyan's reappearance. Ambi's personality alternates between Ambi and Anniyan, resulting in ambiguity. He subdues Prabhakar as Anniyan, but begs for mercy as Ambi. Using CCTV, Chari secretly records the interrogation and uses it as evidence of Ambi's condition during his trial. Ambi is sentenced to psychotherapy in a mental hospital and will be eligible for release when cured.\n\nWhen Ambi is released two years later, his rigid adherence to protocol has diminished. He marries Nandini. While travelling on a train during their honeymoon, he notices a man (an electrician who was indirectly responsible for his sister's death several years ago) drinking amidst fellow passengers. Suffering a relapse, he transforms into Anniyan and throws the man off the train, killing him. However, he hides the incident from Nandini, indicating that he has successfully blended his personalities into one instead of eradicating them."

    "Another 48 Hrs.": "It's five years after the death of Albert Ganz. San Francisco cop Jack Cates is at the Hunter's Point Raceway, checking out Tyrone Burroughs, who, for some reason, is giving some money to mechanic Arthur Brock.\n\nWhen Jack pulls his gun on them, Brock pulls out a gun and starts firing, and Jack shoots Brock dead in self defense as Burroughs escapes with the money. Jack then picks up a picture from the scene -- and it's a picture of Reggie Hammond.\n\nAmong those who show up at the scene are fellow cops Ben Kehoe and Frank Cruise, and also Blake Wilson, the head of the Internal Affairs division. Jack tells Wilson that he shot Brock in self defense, but Cruise says that he can't find Brock's gun.\n\nFor the past four years, Jack has been after a drug kingpin called the Ice Man, and Wilson believes that the Ice Man is a figment of Jack's imagination. The shooting of Arthur Brock was the result of one of Jack's attempts to get a lead on who the Ice Man may be.\n\nJack goes to the prison to visit Reggie, who is still in prison. Reggie is scheduled to be released for good on the next day. Reggie has served 5 extra years in prison after being falsely accused of stealing the prison's payroll.\n\nAfter getting hit in the face with a basketball by Reggie for refusing to promise Reggie his $500,000 unless Reggie helps him find the Ice Man, Jack discovers that Wilson plans to prosecute him on a charge of third degree manslaughter for the Arthur Brock shooting, with Wilson claiming that it was not self defense. Jack is placed on suspension.\n\nOn the next day, as Reggie is being released, Jack tells Reggie about how he has been pursuing the Ice Man for the past four years, and that the Ice Man now wants Reggie dead. That's why Burroughs was giving money to Arthur Brock -- a contract has been put out on Reggie. Reggie still refuses to help Jack, unless Jack gives him his $500,000, which is the same money Albert Ganz was after 5 years ago.\n\nReggie boards the bus that will be transporting him away from prison, and Cates goes to a bar to look over some pictures. Two bikers park across the street from the bar, and one of them walks up to a window and shoots Jack, then the bikers leave. A few minutes later, the bikers pull up beside the prison bus and open fire on Reggie, causing the bus to crash.\n\nAt the hospital, Jack, who was wearing a bulletproof vest, has Reggie released into his custody. Jack wants to know why the Ice Man wants Reggie dead, but Reggie refuses to talk unless he gets his money. Reggie is supposed to be on his way to Florida to join his uncle's used car business, but instead, he's with Jack.\n\nThat night, Jack takes Reggie to Jack's house, where Reggie's Porsche is parked out front, and Jack has installed a car alarm on it. When Reggie presses the car alarm button on the key ring, a bomb in the Porsche explodes. Jack's attitude about it causes Reggie to once again walk away from him.\n\nAt the police station, Jack talks to Wilson, then when he goes out to his car, Reggie is waiting for him. Reggie tells Jack that the Ice Man was the drug dealer that the $500,000 was stolen from by Reggie, Albert Ganz, and their partners Billy Bear, Henry Wong, and Luther.\n\nReggie then tells Jack that he recognized one of the bikers who attacked the prison bus as Richard \"Cherry\" Ganz, Albert Ganz's enraged brother, who wants revenge on Jack and Reggie for Albert Ganz's death.\n\nJack and Reggie head to a bar called Barnstormer's, where Jack questions a barmaid who was harassed by Cherry and the other biker, Willie Hickok. Cherry and Hickok were with Burroughs at the time. Cherry and Hickok had been hired to kill Reggie, and when Brock was killed, Burroughs was trying to hire Brock as backup just in case Cherry and Willie fail.\n\nThe barmaid tells Jack that Cherry and Hickok wanted to know where they could find their old girlfriend Angel Lee, who used to work at Barnstormer's, and then she tells Jack that Angel lives at the King Mei hotel in the Chinatown section of San Francisco, and Angel is now a dancer at the Bird Cage Club.\n\nJack ends up in a bar fight with a man that he put in prison two years ago, and when Jack loses the advantage and starts getting beat up, Reggie saves Jack by shooting one of the assailants in the left kneecap. Jack and Reggie go outside, where Jack complains about forgetting to take his spare gun inside the bar with him, and he punches Reggie for the basketball incident, and Reggie once again walks away from Jack.\n\nAt the King Mei hotel, Jack finds Reggie waiting there, and Reggie says that he's going to stay with Jack this time. But before they do anything, Reggie gets back at Jack by punching Jack in the left arm, right where Jack's bulletproof vest couldn't stop one of Cherry's shots from leaving a deep and painful bruise that goes down to the bone.\n\nJack explains that he punched Reggie outside of the bar in order to get even for the basketball, and Reggie says \"Give me my money back, and you can hit me in my face with the ball.\"\n\nWhile Jack waits downstairs, Reggie goes up to the fourth floor to Angel's room. But Willie, who is inside, fires shots through the door at Reggie, and Cherry shows up and sees Jack. Cherry is stunned, because he thought Jack was dead after he shot Jack. Cherry pulls out his gun and starts firing at Jack. When Cherry and Willie run out of bullets, they flee.\n\nOutside the hotel, after cops including Cruise have arrived, Jack and Reggie talk to Angel, who tells them that Cherry and Willie's contact man is Malcolm Price (Ted Markland), one of the higher-ups in the Western Brotherhood biker gang of Los Angeles.\n\nOn the next day, they go to the prison to visit Reggie's friend Kirkland Smith. Reggie owes Kirkland some money, and Kirkland is losing his patience with Reggie on that.\n\nKirkland tells Jack and Reggie a little bit about Malcolm Price. Kirkland explains that if anyone wants Cherry and Willie to do a hit, they would have to go through Malcolm. Kirkland also tells Jack and Reggie that Malcolm is staying at the Sunset Motel on the beltway. But before Jack and Reggie can get to the motel, the Ice Man shows up and kills Malcolm by shooting Malcolm 16 times.\n\nAfter Jack and Reggie show up at the morgue to see Malcolm, Reggie finally tells Jack why the Ice Man wants Reggie dead -- Reggie has seen the Ice Man's face before, and he can identify the Ice Man. The Ice Man wants Reggie dead so Reggie can't identify him.\n\nAfter hearing what Reggie has to say, Jack thinks Wilson is the ice man. Jack takes Reggie to the court house to get a look at Wilson -- and upon seeing Wilson, Reggie tells Jack that Wilson is not the Ice Man.\n\nMeanwhile, Cherry and Hickok kill Burroughs. Later that same day, Jack, who now thinks that he may never clear his name and find the Ice Man, starts emptying his locker at the police station, and finally gives Reggie his money.\n\nThat night, while Reggie is giving the money that he owes Kirkland to Kirkland's daughter Amy Smith, Cherry and Willie kidnap Reggie and Amy, and take them to the Bird Cage Club, where they meet with Cruise. Cruise orders Cherry and Willie to kill Reggie and Amy, but then Jack shows up. And Reggie identifies the Ice Man as Ben Kehoe.\n\nJack realizes that Kehoe had Cruise pick up Brock's gun at the track because Kehoe wanted Jack out of the way.

    "Another Stakeout": "Early one morning outside of Las Vegas, Nevada, Chicago crime boss Tony Castellano (Miguel Ferrer) disguises himself as a septic worker and pumps gasoline beneath the safe house where police have sheltered Luella \"Lu\" Delano (Cathy Moriarity) and her husband, Michael (Michael DeLano), from potential attack. However, the agents fail to prevent the explosion, which demolishes the house and sets Michael on fire. Once the debris has settled, they are unable to find Lu, infuriating the District Attorney Thomas Hassrick (John Rubinstein), who considers her a crucial witness in the upcoming trial against Castellano. Meanwhile, in Seattle, Washington, undercover police partners Chris Lecce (Richard Dreyfuss) and Bill Reimers (Emilio Estevez) pursue an accused murderer through the city. Although Chris traps his target inside a garbage truck receptacle, the victim's vindictive friend steals his gun and shoots the criminal. When the duo returns to the police precinct, they are reprimanded by the captain and temporarily reassigned to work under Assistant District Attorney Gina Garrett (Rosie O'Donnell). She briefs them on the missing person case of Lu Delano, and instructs them to stake out the home of Lu's Seattle friends, Brian (Dennis Farina) and Pam O'Hara (Marcia Strassman), with whom Lu has made contact. Planning to move into the house next door, Chris and Gina pose as a wealthy married couple with Bill as their son. Chris returns to his apartment to find his girlfriend, Maria McGuire (Madeleine Stowe), in the midst of packing his belongings to throw him out, since he refuses to marry her after six years together. Although Chris relents and agrees to get married, she punches him in the stomach and leaves. Before picking up Gina and her Rottweiler dog, Archie, Chris and Bill receive their undercover vehicle, a red convertible, with strict instructions to return it undamaged. Gina attempts to establish a convincing cover, which requires Bill to shave his mustache to appear younger. Upon arrival at the sprawling bay-front house, Archie chases a stray cat into the O'Hara's yard, which allows the \"family\" to introduce themselves. Throughout the day, Bill becomes paranoid that Maria actually left him for another man, but is unable to reach her. Gina suggests they invite the O'Haras over for drinks, which ignites an argument between her and Chris, who disapproves of the idea. Early the next morning, Bill notices Brian O'Hara leaving his house for a jog and sends Gina to follow him with Archie. Inside, Chris watches Pam O'Hara gardening until Gina eventually returns with a sprained ankle. Later, someone throws a baseball through the window, scaring the officers. Chris discovers the ball belongs to the son of their attractive neighbor, Barbara Burnside (Sharon Maughan). While returning it, he misses a telephone call from Maria. After realizing the O'Haras are not at home, Bill sneaks inside their house to install surveillance equipment, but in his frenzied panic to escape unnoticed, locks his tool bag inside. Gina distracts the returning O'Haras by inviting them to dinner that evening. As she cooks, Bill and Chris threaten to quit the assignment, but Gina's tears persuade them to stay. When the O'Haras arrive, Bill sneaks back inside their house to install the bug, but Lu knocks him unconscious and ties him up in the basement. During dinner, Maria telephones again, forced by an unseen hitman to tell Chris she is moving to Mexico on Friday. Brian overhears the conversation and believes him to be unfaithful to Gina. He confides his discovery to Pam before the two rush to leave. Back at their house, the O'Haras discover that Lu has taken Bill captive and plans to kill him to prevent him from talking. Chris and Gina see the O'Haras dumping Bill's body in the trunk of their car and follow as Lu takes him to the docks. Mistaking him for a hitman hired by Castellano, she takes aim with her handgun, but Bill dives into the bay. Chris speeds toward Lu, who fires at their convertible until she is forced to jump into the water, followed by Chris, who knocks her unconscious. The dock buckles under the weight of the car, and despite Bill's efforts to stop it, collapses. The next morning, Lu meets Gina and the District Attorney and insists she be allowed to see the O'Haras again before she returns to Las Vegas. Outside the O'Hara's house, Bill and Chris see Castellano set up a sniper rifle nearby, preparing to kill Lu. They attempt to warn her, but she again mistakes them as her assassins, prompting their police escorts to open fire. Gina realizes her error, but Castellano shoots the two escorts and the District Attorney. After leading Lu to the outside deck, Gina is taken hostage by Castellano, but Archie the dog knocks them both into the swimming pool. Aiming at Lu, the hitman shoots Gina in the shoulder, and Chris kills him. Saying goodbye to Gina on her way to the hospital, Bill drops Chris off at his apartment. Inside, Chris proposes to Maria, and they kiss while Bill watches through binoculars."

    "Ant-Man": "In 1989, scientist Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) resigns from S.H.I.E.L.D. (led by Howard (John Slattery) and Peggy (Hayley Atwell)) after discovering their attempt to replicate his Ant-Man shrinking technology. Believing the technology is dangerous, Pym vows to hide it as long as he lives. Mitchell Carson wanted to force Hank to surrender the technology but is stopped by Howard and Peggy. Pym had developed the Pym particle which reduces the distance between atoms while increasing density and strength.\n\nIn the present day, Pym's estranged daughter, Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), and former protege, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), have forced him out of his company, Pym Technologies. Cross is close to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own, the Yellowjacket, which horrifies Pym. The Yellowjacket is a highly weapon laden version of his own shrinking suit and can have devastating consequences, if put into production. Unknown to Darren, Hope is spying for Pym and wants Pym to give her his original suit to defeat Darren. But Pym steadily refuses to do that & asks Hope to consider his suggested alternative. However, Darren is having difficulty in achieving a stable molecular reduction, leading to his organic test subjects being reduced to a gooey mass of cells. Eventually, he succeeds.\n\nUpon his release from prison, well-meaning thief Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) moves in with his old cellmate, Luis (Michael Pena). Luis's roommates are Kurt (David Dastmalchian), who is a computer wizard & Dave (Tip \"T.I.\" Harris) a pro lock smith. Lang has a master's in electrical engineering and yet cannot land a job due to his past record and has to serve at a Baskin Robbins. While visiting his daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson) unannounced, Lang is rebuked by his former wife Maggie (Judy Greer) and her police-detective fiance, Paxton (Bobby Cannavale), for not providing child support. Maggie asks Lang to get an apartment and to pay child support before he is allowed his visitation rights with Cassie.\n\nUnable to hold a job because of his criminal record (Lang lies about his past to get the job but is fired whenever his background check is completed), Lang agrees to join Luis' crew and commit a burglary. Lang breaks into a house and cracks its safe, but only finds what he believes to be an old motorcycle suit, which he takes home. Unknown to Lang, the entire burglary was being observed by an ant with a micro-camera on it, which was relaying a live feed to Pym. After trying the suit on, Lang accidentally shrinks himself to the size of an insect. Terrified by the experience (during which Pym speaks to Lang via his helmet), he returns the suit to the house, but is arrested on the way out. Pym, the homeowner, visits Lang in jail and smuggles the suit into his cell to help him break out with the assistance of ants and flying insects.\n\nAt his home, Pym, who manipulated Lang through an unknowing Luis into stealing the suit as a test, wants Lang to become the new Ant-Man to steal the Yellowjacket from Cross. Pym says that he generates Electro-magnetic waves to stimulate the ant's olfactory nerves and is thus able to speak to them and get them to obey his commands.\n\nHope still believes that she can defeat Darren, but Pym is afraid to lose her as he did her mother. Pym explains to Lang that he designed a formula 40 years ago to shrink humans inside his suit. But he hid the formula as it was dangerous. He started his own company, Pym tech, & took Darren on as his protege. With time Darren suspected the existence of Pym's formula. When Pym did not cooperate with Darre, he voted Pym out of his own company.\n\nHope was angry with Pym for the death of her mother & helped Darren. But then she came back to Pym when she saw that Darren was loco. Pym's plan is to train Lang to use the suit & to break into Darren's lab, steal his suit & destroy all the data. Pym says that his specially designed helmet helps protect the brain chemistry, something that Darren has ignored in the design of his suit.\n\nHaving been spying on Cross after discovering his intentions, Hope helps Pym train Lang to fight in the suit and to control ants. While Hope harbors resentment towards Pym about her mother Janet's (Hayley Lovitt) death, he reveals that Janet, known as the Wasp, disappeared into a subatomic quantum realm to disable a Soviet nuclear missile (it was headed for the US and the only way to disable it was to go subatomic through solid titanium. Pym's own regulator was damaged, and so Janet stepped up). Pym warns Lang that he could suffer a similar fate if he overrides his suit's regulator. They send him to steal a device that will aid their heist from the Avengers' headquarters, where he briefly fights Sam Wilson/Falcon (Anthony Mackie).\n\nCross perfects the Yellowjacket and hosts an unveiling ceremony at Pym Technologies' headquarters. Lang, along with his crew and a swarm of flying ants, infiltrates the building during the event, sabotages the company's servers, and plants explosives. When he attempts to steal the Yellowjacket, he, along with Pym and Hope, are captured by Cross, who intends to sell both the Yellowjacket and Ant-Man suits to Hydra, led by former S.H.I.E.L.D officer Mitchell Carson (Martin Donovan). Lang breaks free and he and Hope dispatch most of the Hydra agents, though Carson is able to flee with a vial of Cross' particles. Lang pursues Cross as he escapes, while the explosives detonate, imploding the building.\n\nCross dons the Yellowjacket and attacks Lang before Lang is arrested by Paxton. His mind addled by the imperfect shrinking technology, Cross takes Cassie hostage to lure Lang into another fight. Lang overrides the regulator and shrinks to subatomic size to penetrate Cross' suit and sabotage it to shrink uncontrollably, killing Cross. Lang disappears into the quantum realm but manages to reverse the effects and returns to the macroscopic world.\n\nIn gratitude for Lang's heroism, Paxton covers for Lang to keep him out of prison. Seeing that Lang survived and returned from the quantum realm, Pym wonders if his wife is alive as well. Later, Lang meets up with Luis, who tells him that Wilson is looking for him.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Pym shows Van Dyne a new Wasp prototype suit and offers it to her. In a post-credits scene, Wilson and Steve Rogers have Bucky Barnes in their custody. Unable to contact Tony Stark because of \"the accords\", Wilson mentions that he knows someone who could help."

    "Ant-Man and the Wasp": "In 1987, Janet Van Dyne / Wasp (Michelle Pfeiffer) shrinks between the molecules of a Soviet nuclear missile, disabling it but becoming trapped in the sub-atomic quantum realm. Hank was with Janet, but his regulator malfunctioned preventing him from going sub-atomic, and thus Janet had to step up to stop the missile from exploding. Hank Pym / Ant-Man (Michael Douglas) (A former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, entomologist, and physicist who became the original Ant-Man after discovering the subatomic particles that make the transformation possible) raises their daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) believing that Janet is dead.\n\nYears later, former criminal Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) takes up the mantle of Ant-Man and discovers a way to both enter and return from the quantum realm. Pym and Hope begin work on repeating this feat, believing they may find Janet alive. Pym starts building a Quantum tunnel which would allow a person to enter and exit the Quantum realm. Lang and Hope also start a romantic relationship and begin training to fight together as Ant-Man and the Wasp, until Lang secretly helps Captain America during a skirmish between the Avengers in violation of the Sokovia Accords. Lang makes a deal with the Department of Defense and is allowed to return home in exchange for 2 years of house arrest (followed by 3 years of probation), while Pym and Hope go into hiding and cut ties with Lang. As per the deal, Lang cannot be in touch with Pym or Hope. Any violation of the deal means 20 years in prison for Lang. Lang spends time at home with his daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson) and his business associate Luis (Michael Pena).\n\nTwo years later, Pym and Hope briefly manage to open a tunnel to the quantum realm. Lang receives an apparent message from Janet with whom he is quantum state entangled. The message was in form of a dream that Lang gets while sleeping. Despite having only days left of house arrest; Lang decides to call Pym. Hope kidnaps Lang, leaving a giant ant as a decoy (wearing Lang's leg brace) so as not to arouse suspicion from FBI agent Jimmy Woo (Randall Park). Seeing the message as confirmation that Janet is alive (In the dream Janet was playing hide and seek with little Hope. Hope was hiding in a closet, which had horses on it and this was the same place where she hid every time), Pym and Hope work to create a stable tunnel so they can take a vehicle to the quantum realm and retrieve Janet. Hope arranges to buy a part needed for the tunnel from black market dealer Sonny Burch (Walton Goggins), but Burch has realized the potential profit that can be earned from Pym and Hope's research and double-crosses them & refuses to sell the part to Hope unless she makes him partner in their research.\n\nHope fights Burch and his men off, until she is attacked by a quantum state unstable masked woman. Lang tries to help fight off this \"ghost\", but she escapes with Pym's portable lab (Pym designed a full-sized building as his lab, but then shrank it so that he could carry it around like luggage).\n\nPym cannot locate the lab as he needs his equipment, and all his equipment is inside the lab. Pym reluctantly visits his estranged former partner Bill Foster (Laurence Fishburne) (An old friend of Pym who was once his assistant on Project Goliath) who helps them locate the lab. Foster went as big as 21 feet in experiments back in his day, while Lang claims that he went to 65 feet in Berlin. Foster claims that Pym drove everyday away due to his ego, and only Janet could stick with him, and she paid the price for that by getting stuck in the Quantum realm.\n\nPym and Hope implement the idea of using the regulator on Lang's old suit to find the lab and it works. The ghost restrains Lang, Hope, and Pym when they arrive, and reveals herself to be Ava Starr (Hannah John-Kamen). Her father Elihas was another former partner of Pym's and they worked together at SHEILD. Pym had Elihas discredited and fired. Elihas was desperate to earn his reputation back and he started conducting Quantum experiments at home. He accidentally killed himself and his wife during a quantum experiment that caused Ava's unstable state of molecular Disequilibrium. This means that every cell in her body is torn apart and stitched back together every day.\n\nShe was discovered alive after the blast and handed over to SHEILD. SHEILD converted Ava in a weapon, and she did what she was asked, against the promise of a cure. But SHEILD lied and when it collapsed, Foster stepped in. Foster reveals that he has been helping Ava (Foster built Ava a containment chamber to slow her decay, but hasn't succeeded), who they plan to cure using Janet's quantum energy. Believing that this will kill Janet, Pym refuses to help them and the trio manage to escape.\n\nOpening a stable version of the tunnel this time, Pym and Hope are able to contact Janet, who gives them a precise location to find her, but warns that they only have two hours before the unstable nature of the realm separates them for a century. Burch learns their location from Lang's business partners Luis (Michael Pe\u00f1a), Dave (Tip \"T.I.\" Harris), and Kurt (David Dastmalchian), and informs a contact at the FBI. Luis warns Lang, who rushes home before Woo can see him breaking his house arrest. This leaves Pym and Hope to be arrested by the FBI, and for their lab to be taken by Ava.\n\nLang is soon able to help Pym and Hope escape custody, and they find the lab (through A new tracker that Pym installed when he got the lab back briefly). Lang and Hope distract Ava while Pym enters the quantum realm to retrieve Janet, but the pair end up fighting Burch and his men, which allows Ava to enter the lab and then enter the quantum realm and to begin taking Janet's energy. Luis, Dave, and Kurt help apprehend Burch, so Lang and Hope can stop Ava. Pym and Janet arrive safely from the quantum realm, and Janet voluntarily gifts some of her energy to Ava to temporarily stabilize her.\n\nLang returns home once again, in time for a now suspicious Woo to release him at the end of his house arrest. Ava and Foster go into hiding. In a mid-credits scene, Pym, Lang, Hope, and Janet plan to harvest quantum energy to continue helping Ava. While Lang is in the quantum realm doing this, Pym, Hope, and Janet disintegrate."

    "Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania": "During her days of entrapment in the Quantum Realm, Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) (Pym's wife, Hope's mother, and the original Wasp, who was lost in the Quantum Realm for 30 years) encounters an exiled traveler named Kang (Jonathan Majors). Kang is a \"time-traveling, Multiversal adversary\" trapped in the Quantum Realm who needs Pym Particles to get his ship and a device online that would allow him to go anywhere and when in time.\n\nIn the present day, after the Avengers' battle against Thanos. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) (An Avenger and former petty criminal with a suit that allows him to shrink or grow in scale while increasing in strength) has become a successful Memoirist and has been living happily with his girlfriend, Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) (The daughter of Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne who is handed down a similar suit and the Wasp mantle from her mother). Hope has taken back her father's company and is using the Pym Particle for the betterment of humanity. Scott's now-teenage daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) has become a political activist in helping people displaced by the Blip, resulting in her having a strained relationship with her father.\n\nWhile visiting Hope's parents, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) (A former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, entomologist, and physicist who became the original Ant-Man after creating the suit) and Janet, Cassie reveals that she has been working on a device that can establish contact with the Quantum Realm. Upon learning of this, Janet panics and forcefully shuts off the device, but the message is received, resulting in a portal that opens and sucks the five of them into the Quantum Realm. Hank and Cassie's ants, who by now are highly evolved are also sucked in. Scott and Cassie (who are separated from the others) are found by natives who are rebelling against their ruler, while Hope, Janet, and Pym explore a sprawling city to get answers.\n\nHope, Janet, and Pym meet with Lord Krylar (Bill Murray) (The governor of the lavish Axia community in the Quantum Realm), a former ally of Janet's, who reveals that things have changed since she left, and that he is now working for Kang, the Quantum Realm's new ruler. The three are forced to flee and steal Krylar's ship. The Langs, meanwhile, are told by rebel leader Jentorra (Katy O'Brian) (The leader of the Freedom Fighters rebelling against Kang's oppression of the communities in the Quantum Realm) that Janet's involvement with Kang is indirectly responsible for his rise to power.\n\nThe rebels soon come under attack by Kang's forces led by M.O.D.O.K. (Mechanized Organism designed only for killing), who is revealed to be Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) (Pym's former protege who was shrunken to subatomic size in the Quantum Realm during the events of Ant-Man (2015) and became a mutated, Cybernetically enhanced individual with an oversized head known as M.O.D.O.K.), having survived his apparent death at the hands of Scott.\n\nAboard Krylar's ship, Janet confesses to Hope and Pym why she wanted nothing to do with the Quantum Realm again; Kang claimed that he and Janet could both escape from the Quantum Realm if she helped him rebuild his Multiversal power core. After they managed to repair it, Janet saw a vision of Kang conquering and destroying entire time-lines. Kang revealed he was exiled by his variants out of fear, which drove Janet to turn against him. Outmatched, Janet used her Pym Particles to enlarge the power core beyond use. Kang, having regained his powers, eventually conquered the Quantum Realm afterward.\n\nThe Langs are taken to Kang, who demands that Scott helps get his power core back or else he will kill Cassie. Scott is then taken to the core's location and shrinks down. He is nearly drowned in a sea of variants of himself (as Scott approaches the core, he is in the storm of probability where every possible version of himself exists simultaneously), but Hope arrives and helps him acquire the power core. However, Kang reneges on the deal, capturing Janet and destroying her ship with Hank on it. After being rescued by his ants, who were also pulled into the Quantum Realm, rapidly evolved, and became hyper-intelligent, Pym helps Scott and Hope as they make their way to Kang.\n\nKang reveals his plan to use the power core to transport his entire army to the multi-verse to eliminate his other variants and to take complete control of the time-lines. But the uprising brings the entire Quantum realm to fight against Kang and his forces are near defeat. Kang is forced to enter the battle himself, allowing Janet to escape captivity and pursue the power core. Kang forces the rebels to run for cover and the revolution is almost defeated. This is when Hank's ants enter the battle and turn the tide in the rebels favor. During the fight, Cassie convinces Cross to switch sides and fight Kang, though he sacrifices his life. The ants are technologically superior to Kang and are able to easily overrun him.\n\nJanet fixes the power core as she, Pym, Hope, and Cassie jump through a portal home, but Kang attacks Scott. Before he can beat Scott into submission, Hope returns, and she and Scott throw Kang and Pym Particles into the power core, destroying them both. Cassie reopens the portal for Scott and Hope to return home. As Scott happily resumes his life, he begins to rethink what he was told about Kang's death being the start of something terrible happening but brushes it off.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene: numerous variants of Kang, led by Immortus, commiserate Kang's death and plan their Multiversal uprising.\n\nIn a post-credits scene: Loki and Mobius M. Mobius encounter another Kang variant, Victor Timely, on Earth in 1901."

Accepting Winston's offer, Hoffman and his girlfriend, Alice Poulson (Claire Forlani), move to NURV headquarters in Portland, Oregon.\n\nDespite development of the flagship product (Synapse, a worldwide media distribution network) being well on schedule, Hoffman soon becomes suspicious of the excellent source code Winston personally provides to him, seemingly when needed most, while refusing to divulge the code's origin.\n\nAfter his best friend, Teddy Chin (Yee Jee Tso), is murdered, Hoffman discovers that NURV is stealing the code they need from programmers around the world including Chin and then killing them to cover their tracks. Hoffman learns that not only does NURV employ an extensive surveillance system to observe and steal code, the company has infiltrated the Justice Department and most of the mainstream media. Even his girlfriend is a plant, an ex-con hired by the company to manipulate him.\n\nWhile searching through a secret NURV database containing surveillance dossiers on employees, he finds that the company has information of a very personal nature about a friend and co-worker, Lisa Calighan (Rachel Leigh Cook). When he reveals to her that the company has this information, she agrees to help him expose NURV's crimes to the world. Coordinating with one of Hoffman's friends (Nate Dushku) from his old startup, they plan to use a local cable access station to hijack Synapse and broadcast their charges against NURV to the world. However, Calighan turns out to be a double agent, foils Hoffman's plan, and turns him over to Winston.\n\nHoffman had already confronted Poulson and convinced her to side with him against Winston and NURV. When it became clear that Hoffman had not succeeded, a backup plan is put into motion by Poulson, the fourth member of Skullbocks (Tygh Runyan), and the incorruptible internal security firm hired by NURV. As Winston prepares to kill Hoffman, the second team successfully usurps one of NURV's own work centers \"Building 21\" and transmits the incriminating evidence as well as the Synapse code. Winston and his entourage are publicly arrested for their crimes. After parting ways with the redeemed Poulson, Hoffman rejoins Skullbocks."

The group's leader explains that their lands were ravaged and asks for permission to pass through the jungle. When Jaguar Paw and his tribesmen return home, Flint Sky tells his son not to let the refugees' fear infect him.\n\nThe next morning, after Jaguar Paw wakes from a nightmare involving the refugee leader, he sees warriors entering the village and setting the huts on fire. The raiders, led by Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo), attack and subdue the villagers. Jaguar Paw slips out with his pregnant wife Seven (Dalia Hern\u00e1ndez) and his little son Turtles Run (Carlos Emilio B\u00e1ez), lowering them by vine into a deep vertical cave, tying the vine off so they could climb out later. Jaguar Paw then kills a raider and returns to help the village. He is eventually subdued, and a raider named Middle Eye (Gerardo Taracena), whom Jaguar Paw almost killed, slits Flint Sky's throat while the bound Jaguar Paw can only watch. Before the raiders leave with their prisoners, Snake Ink, one of the raider captains, notices Jaguar Paw staring toward the cave. Suspicious of the tied off vine hanging into the cave, he cuts it, trapping Seven and Turtles Run. Jaguar Paw and the other captives are then led off into the jungle.\n\nA short distance from the village they join another group of raiders who have captured the refugees Jaguar Paw met the day before. Later, Cocoa Leaf, a wounded captive tied to the same pole as Jaguar Paw nearly tumbles off a cliff, but Jaguar Paw and the others are able to pull him back up with incredible effort. Though Middle Eye, who is guarding them, is impressed by this show of brute power, he kills Cocoa Leaf by cutting him loose and pushing him off the cliff.\n\nThe raiding party march toward a Mayan city, encountering razed forests and failed maize crops, along with villages decimated by plague. A small girl dying of plague prophesies that there will be a solar eclipse and a man running with a jaguar will bring the raiders to those who will scratch out the earth and end their world. In the city's outskirts, where the prisoners come upon slaves working in lime quarries, the female captives are sold as slaves while the males are escorted to the top of a step pyramid. The high priest sacrifices several captives, including Jaguar Paw's friend Curl Nose (Am\u00edlcar Ram\u00edrez), by cutting out their beating hearts before beheading them.\n\nWhen Jaguar Paw is about to be sacrificed, a solar eclipse occurs. The high priest looks at the emperor and the two share a knowing smile while the people below panic at the phenomenon. The priest declares the god Kukulkan is satisfied with the sacrifices. He asks Kukulkan to let light return to the world and the eclipse passes. The crowd cheers in amazement and the priest orders that the remaining captives be led away and \"disposed of\".\n\nZero Wolf takes the captives to a ball court. The captives are released in pairs and forced to run the length of the open space within the ball court, offering Zero Wolf's men some target practice, with a cynical promise of freedom should they reach the end of the field alive. Zero Wolf's son, Cut Rock (Ricardo D\u00edaz Mendoza), is sent to the end of the field to \"finish\" any survivors. The raiders target the runners with Atlatls, arrows, and large stones. The first pair are Jaguar Paw's last living friends, Smoke Frog and Blunted (Jonathan Brewer). Smoke Frog is struck by a heavy stone, then finished off by Cut Rock while Blunted is impaled through the stomach by a dart launched with an Atlatl.\n\nNext up are Jaguar Paw and the refugee leader from the beginning. Although they almost make it, the refugee leader is shot through the head with an arrow and Jaguar Paw is shot in the waist with another arrow although he is able to break off the arrowhead. As Cut Rock approaches to finish Jaguar Paw, the not-quite-dead Blunted trips Cut Rock to buy Jaguar Paw time. Cut Rock gets up and savagely kills Blunted, then turns to finish off Jaguar Paw who reaches up and slices through Cut Rock's neck with the arrowhead. Jaguar Paw then pulls the arrow from his back and stumbles away towards the jungle.\n\nAs Cut Rock bleeds out with Zero Wolf easing him into the next life, Jaguar Paw runs through a withered maize field and an open mass grave of sacrificial victims before finally reaching the jungle. The enraged Zero Wolf and his eight men pursue Jaguar Paw into the jungle and back toward Jaguar Paw's home. Eventually climbing up a tree, the pursuers move past him, but a black jaguar who has made the tree its home is angered by him and gives chase. A long way running, Jaguar Paw and the jaguar are seen running by the raiders, at first, they only see Jaguar Paw and move to intercept him, but one of the raiders is killed by the jaguar. The raiders are forced to stay and kill the jaguar, and then ponder this next fulfillment of the girl's prophecy. Again, in pursuit, another raider, Drunkards Four, is killed when a venomous snake bites his neck. Eventually, after running all night, Jaguar Paw finds himself caught between a high waterfall and the raiders and is forced to jump. He survives and declares from the riverbank below that the raiders are now in his homelands, echoing his father's challenge to the refugees at the beginning of the film.\n\nAfter listening to Jaguar Paw's challenge, Zero Wolf says they must pursue over the waterfall, but Snake Ink says they will climb down around the side after Jaguar Paw but is stabbed by Zero Wolf for his impudence. Zero Wolf then commands that he and his men jump the falls and in shock, they all jump as well. While most make it alive, one smashes his head on the rocks below and is killed. The remaining men swim to the shore and restart their pursuit. Jaguar Paw escapes a pool of black quicksand and now camouflaged in mud, resolves to become the hunter rather than the hunted.\n\nFirst he disables his pursuers by throwing a hornets' nest into their midst (Jaguar Paw is protected from the hornets by his coating of black mud); next he kills one raider with poison darts using poison he extracts from a tree toad. This leads to his showdown with the sadistic Middle Eye, who Jaguar Paw bludgeons to death with the Mayan war club of the raider he just killed. However, much to Jaguar Paw's worries, it begins raining heavily, with the cave where Jaguar Paw's wife and son are trapped starting to flood. As he rushes to save his family, Jaguar Paw is confronted by Zero Wolf and is shot again with an arrow. As Zero Wolf advances to finish Jaguar Paw he blunders into Jaguar Paw's hunting trap; he is impaled and killed.\n\nFollowing Zero Wolf's death, the two remaining raiders chase Jaguar Paw out to a beach where, much to the surprise of all three of them, they encounter conquistador ships anchored off the coast, with men making their way ashore. The amazement of the raiders allows Jaguar Paw to flee. He returns into the forest to pull his wife and son out of the flooded pit where they are hiding, and where Seven has just given birth to a second son. As the reunited family look out from the forest towards the Spanish ships, Seven wonders if they should go to them, but Jaguar Paw says they should return to the forest in search of a new beginning."

    "Appleseed": "Deunan Knute is a young highly skilled female soldier and is one of the last survivors of the Global War. During a battle, she is rescued by Hitomi, a Second Generation Bioroid. Deunan attempts to escape from a hospital and takes Hitomi hostage, but is stopped by Briareos Hecatonchires, her former lover, who is now a cyborg. She learns that the war had ended and she is in a Utopian city called Olympus. Its population is half-human and half-clone, a genetically-engineered species called Bioroids. Olympus is governed by three factions: Prime Minister Athena Areios; General Edward Uranus III, head of the Olympus Army; and a Council of Elders. Everything in the city is observed by an artificial intelligence named Gaia from a building called Tartaros. While there, Deunan joins the ESWAT organization.\n\nThe Bioroids were created from the DNA of Deunan's father, Carl, making the Second Generation Bioroids her brothers and sisters. However, they have a much shorter lifespan than humans due to suppressed reproductive capabilities. The Bioroids life extension facilities are destroyed by a secret faction of the Regular Army in a terrorist attack against the Bioroids. However, the Appleseed data, which contains information on restoring the Bioroids reproduction capabilities, still exists.\n\nOlympus is plagued by conflicting factions. Along with a strike force, Deunan and Briareos head to the building where the Bioroids were originally created. She activates a holographic recording showing the location of the Appleseed data. Dr. Gilliam Knute, who created the Bioroids, entrusted Appleseed to Deunan, but was shot by a soldier. Colonel Hades, the anti-Bioroid terrorist, reveals to Deunan that Briareos had intentionally allowed his Landmate, a large exoskeleton-like battlesuits, to escape. They run to the roof where their team is killed and they are cornered by the Regular Army. Uranus tries to convince Deunan that Bioroids seek to control humanity, and he wants to destroy D-Tank full of virus material in Tartarus. Briareos tells Uranus that the Elders were the ones who planned this; the D-tanks virus was originally believed to keep Bioroids in line, but in actuality is capable of sterilizing humanity. Hades convinces Uranus that negotiating is pointless, and blames Carl for all that has happened before Deunan kills him. They manage to escape, and later wash up on a beach. Briareos, badly damaged in the firefight, lays dying in the sand. Grief-stricken, Deunan refuses to leave his side. Briareos confeses everything to Deunan, hoping to coax her into continuing on. Mechanic Yoshitsune Miyamoto arrives in his Landmate and begins repairing Briareos. Deunan takes the Landmate back to Olympus, where the Appleseed data is used to fully restore Bioroid reproductive functions.\n\nDespite the relief, Deunan confronts the Council of Elders and force them to admit that they killed her mother. They reveal they plan to use the D-tank virus to sterilize all humans, allowing their race to die out slowly, leaving the Bioroids the new rulers of Earth. They needed the Appleseed data to keep the Bioroids alive, but Gilliam hid the data so they could not move forward with their plan. Athena, stepping in to stop them and announcing that Uranus has surrendered, tells Deunan that the Elders had been acting on their own and had shut Gaia down once they realized humanity had softened their stance against Bioroids. The Elders state that they will soon die since Gaia kept them alive, but that they were ready to sacrifice themselves. They then activate the city's mobile fortress defenses, which begin marching towards Tartaros. Athena states that D-tank's security system is nearly impenetrable, but a shot from the fortresses' main cannons might puncture the tank, releasing the virus. ESWAT begins mobilizing, but suffer heavy casualties due to the fortresses' heavy weaponry.\n\nBriareos arrives and asks Deunan to join the battle. Despite the Elders objections, Deunan goes with Briareos to the towers. Deunan attempts to enter the password to shut the defenses down, but a malfunction makes it difficult to complete. The final password letter appears by itself, and Deunan secures the D-Tank.\n\nThe film ends with Deunan stating that the sins of humanity will probably get worse, but that there is always the chance that future generations will learn from these mistakes. She vows to keep fighting for the children, who are \"the true new race of man.\""

    "Appleseed: Ex Machina": "Following the events of Appleseed, ESWAT members Deunan Knute and Briareos Hecatonchires infiltrate a cathedral somewhere outside of Olympus and find European Union officials taken hostages. After rescuing the EU officials and destroying the cyborgs, ESWAT return to Olympus, where Briareos is confined to hospital until he recovers, while Deunan continues ESWAT work. When Deunan's commanding officer Lance introduces her to her new partner, Tereus, she is shocked as her partner resembles Briareos' human form.\n\nDeunan confronts Lance for an explanation, and is given the tour of the new Bioroid production facility. During the tour, Hitomi, a bioroid that Deunan befriended during those events, is mentioned to now be a minister of political affairs. Here it is shown that Tereus is actually a Bioroid; a prototype for a whole new production line of Bioroids to be soldiers without negative emotions to impact their judgment in fighting. As his physical and mental strength was found to be most desirable in ESWAT, Briareos' DNA was used mostly in Tereus' design. Reluctantly, Deunan is partnered up with Tereus to evaluate his performance. While departing, Deunan encounters Hitomi and Hitomi gives her a ride home. Deunan notices that many Olympus citizens are wearing Connexus; a device on their ears which projects holographic data over the eyes.\n\nDeunan, Lance and Hitomi visit Briareos, still recovering in hospital. Here, Lance states that out of the last five terrorist incidents, four of them have been by groups composed solely of cyborgs, with transmitted signals from surrounding locations, thus suggesting that digitally vulnerable cyborgs are actually being manipulated to perform these acts. Because many of these cyborgs consist of parts made by Poseidon, a multinational industrial conglomerate, an emissary is sent to Prime Minister Athena. The emissary denies Poseidon blame, but Olympus still boycotts them, which Poseidon finds undesirable as other world powers may follow suit.\n\nMeanwhile, Hitomi hosts a birthday party, in which Deunan is happy to find Briareos attending now that he's fully recovered. Briareos meets Tereus for the first time - which makes him uncomfortable - but the two accept each other. Briareos also accepts Deunan's new partnership with Tereus, and has found someone other than Deunan to partner with, which upsets her. She storms off, but is eventually joined by Tereus, who displays many of Briareos' personality traits, which by Deunan's own admission makes her feel \"confused.\"\n\nThe next day, Athena and an assemblage of world leaders discuss making a global security network by merging all the satellites worldwide to prevent terrorist attacks before they happen. ESWAT and the Olympus police forces set up barricades around the conference hall. ESWAT personnel pick up the broadcast of an unknown signal. Soon enough, a variety of vehicles and non-cybernetic humans begin to assault the conference, much to the confusion of ESWAT and the regular police. Even more strangely, at the same time, Aeacus kills a engineer on board an ESWAT transport, declaring, \"We will all be one. I am Halcon\" and destroys it to escape wearing his Land-Mate. Briareos rushes to the explosion, and initially tries to stop Aeacus but ends up killing him. As Deunan and Tereus arrive, Tereus uncovers the mysterious signal coming from robotic doves. Simultaneously, the unknown signal disappears, and the attackers collapse. A funeral is held sometime later for Aeacus.\n\nAt the same time all the satellites are joined, Briareos is nearly run down by an unmanned vehicle. He stops it but suddenly goes berserk and hacks into a public terminal, crashing the main satellite control, forcing Olympus to switch to a backup. Briareos is hospitalized, with the unknown signal ruled out as the cause of his outburst. Briareos gets suspicious of his cyborg doctor, Richard Kestner, who operated on him after his accident. He has Hitomi look up Kestner's files, learning that he once worked with Poseidon's Halcon Laboratories - but all records of his project are mysteriously erased. Briaereos breaks out and tracks down Kestner, who confesses that he is part of a plan to \"unify\" humanity through erasing individuality, to which he attributes the source of human conflict. He then reveals that he secretly injected Briareos with nanites designed to take control of his body when his adrenaline heats up. Kestner then commits suicide before the police arrive, making them think that Briareos killed him. Briareos escapes, but is cornered by Tereus. Deunan arrives just on scene with an antidote designed to suppress the nanites.\n\nThe virus Kestner placed in the backup network takes control of the satellites and, through these satellites, all people linked to the Connexus, compelling them to riot against Olympus. Believing that Poseidon knows something about all this, Briareos, Tereus and Deunan track down a Poseidon convoy to learn about Halcon. As they discover, Halcon was once the leading scientific laboratory until they started mind control experiments, which Poseidon was forced to end when the project lead Elizabeth Xander was killed in an accident. Poseidon assists the ESWAT officers in infiltrating the fortress where the Halcon signal is transmitting. Once they are in the control center, they discover that Xander was resurrected as a cyborg to control all those linked to the Connexus. After destroying her, thus freeing all the enthralled, the heroes escape the collapsing fortress and return to Olympus."

    "Aquaman": "In 1985 Maine, lighthouse keeper Thomas Curry (Temuera Morrison) rescues Atlanna (Nicole Kidman), the princess of the underwater nation of Atlantis, during a storm. Thomas brings Atlanna inside his house and tends to her wounds. She gains consciousness a few days later. Atlanna was fleeing an arranged marriage in her Kingdom. They eventually fall in love and have a son named Arthur (Jason Momoa), who is born with the power to communicate with marine lifeforms. Atlanna is forced to abandon her family and return to Atlantis, entrusting to her loyal advisor Nuidis Vulko (Willem Dafoe) (Atlantis' counselor, who was a mentor of Arthur Curry when he was young) the mission of training Arthur. Under Vulko's guidance, Arthur becomes a skilled warrior but is rejected by the Atlanteans for being a half-breed and ultimately leaves Atlantis behind.\n\nIn the present, one year after Steppenwolf's invasion, Arthur confronts a group of pirates attempting to hijack a Russian Naval nuclear submarine. Arthur carries the submarine to the surface, kills the pirates and rescues all the sailors, who had locked themselves in the aft compartment. The leader of the pirates, Jessie Kane (Michael Beach), dies during the confrontation while his son, David (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), vows revenge upon Arthur. Arthur defeats David in battle, impales Jessie on a pipe and leaves both Jessie and David to die when one of Jessie's bullets punctures the submarine's hull. David begs Arthur to help save Jessie, but Arthur walks away. Jessie sacrifices himself by exploding a grenade, to force David to leave and save himself. David's grandfather was one of the first frogmen in the Navy and served in WWII. He was considered very stealthy and was nick-named Manta, in honor of his skill.\n\nDavid later targets Atlantis, with another attack submarine) at the behest of Orm (Patrick Wilson) (who seeks to unite the seven underwater kingdoms to declare war on the surface world out of the belief that humanity polluted the seas), Arthur's younger half-brother and Atlantis' king who uses the attack as a pretext to declare war on the surface. Turns out this is why David and Jessie were stealing a nuclear submarine, so they could attack Atlantis and give an excuse to Orm to declare war on the surface dwellers. King Nereus was reluctant to declare war and tells Orm that the 4 of the 7 ocean Kingdoms (Atlantis, Xebel, the Fishermen, the Brine, the Deserters, the Lost Nation and the Trench) need to agree for war. Nereus also knows that if the 4 Kingdoms agree with Orm, he will be declared Ocean Master.\n\nKing Nereus (Dolph Lundgren) of Xebel swears allegiance to Orm's cause (He was not very keen initially, but agrees once David had attacked Atlantis), but his daughter Mera (Amber Heard) (Mera possesses Hydrokinetic and Telepathic powers that allow her to control her aquatic environment and communicate with other Atlanteans), who has been betrothed to Orm, refuses to aid them and journeys to the surface to ask Arthur for help, earning his trust by saving Thomas from a tidal wave sent by Orm as a message to the surface dwellers, that the oceans have declared war on them. Mera tells Arthur that the only way to stop the war is for Arthur to claim his rightful place on the throne of Atlantis. He is the first born of Queen Atlanna.\n\nArthur reluctantly accompanies Mera to a rendezvous with Vulko, who urges Arthur to find the Trident of Atlan, a magic artifact that once belonged to Atlantis' first ruler in order to reclaim his rightful place as king. Arthur will be able to press his claim to the throne with the trident in his possession. They are ambushed by Orm's men and Mera and Vulko escape without having been seen, while Arthur is captured.\n\nOrm visits Arthur in captivity and announces that Atlanna was executed for the crime of having a half-breed son, blaming Arthur and the surface for her death. He offers Arthur an opportunity to leave forever, but Arthur instead challenges him to a duel in a ring of underwater lava. Orm gains the upper hand and nearly kills Arthur before Mera rescues him. Together, Arthur and Mera journey to the Sahara Desert where the trident was forged and unlock a holographic message that leads them to Sicily, Italy, where they retrieve the trident's coordinates. Meanwhile, Orm provides David with a prototype Atlantean battle suit to kill Arthur, imprisons Vulko upon learning of his betrayal, and coerces the remaining kingdoms of Atlantis to pledge their allegiance to him and his campaign against the surface.\n\nAfter modifying Orm's technology, a fully armored David rechristens himself as Black Manta and ambushes Arthur and Mera in Sicily, injuring Arthur before being thrown off a cliff to his apparent death. Mera nurses Arthur's wounds as they journey to the trident's whereabouts (in the middle of the ocean) and encourages him to embrace his destiny as a hero. Arriving at their destination, Arthur and Mera are attacked by a legion of amphibious monsters known as The Trench but manage to fend them off and reach a wormhole that transports them to an uncharted sea located at the center of the Earth. There, they are unexpectedly reunited with Queen Atlanna, who was sacrificed to the Trench for her crimes but managed to escape and reach the uncharted sea, where she has been stranded ever since.\n\nArthur faces Karathen, the mythical leviathan that guards the trident, and voices his determination to protect both Atlantis and the surface, proving his worth and reclaiming the trident, which grants him control over the seven seas. Orm and his allies lead an army against the crustacean forces of the Kingdom of the Brine with the intent of completing Orm's surface battle preparations. As Orm declares himself Ocean Master, Arthur, and Mera, with the assistance of Karathen and the Trench, intervene and lead an army of marine creatures in a battle against him. Orm's followers renounce their obedience to him and embrace Arthur as the true king upon learning he wields the trident.\n\nOrm has no option but to challenge Arthur in 1 to 1 battle, as only Arthur's death can give him the throne. But this time, Mera advises Arthur to choose the surface, an element that is alien to Orm. Arthur defeats Orm in combat but chooses to spare his life and Orm accepts his fate after discovering Arthur has found and rescued Atlanna. Atlanna returns to the surface to reunite with Thomas while Arthur ascends to the throne with Mera by his side.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, David is rescued by Dr. Stephen Shin, a scientist obsessed with finding Atlantis, and agrees to lead Shin there in exchange for his help in his revenge on Arthur."

    "Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom": "Arthur Curry has married Mera and had a son, Arthur Jr., and splits his life between land, where he lives in the lighthouse of his father Tom and fights crime, and the sea, ruling as the King of Atlantis. However, Arthur finds the diplomatic and bureaucratic royal duties boring, and is always entering conflict with the Atlantean council, who are particularly opposed to Arthur's intent of making Atlantis contact the surface world. Meanwhile, David Kane continues to seek revenge against Aquaman, and follows the research of marine scientist Stephen Shin to look for Atlantean artifacts. Once in an Atlantean ruin underneath the Arctic ice, David finds a black trident, that leads him to be possessed by its creator, who promises that if David helps his Atlantean tribe recover, David will receive the power he desires to destroy Aquaman, his family, and his kingdom. Five months later, global warming has worsened, with the surface's climate experiencing extreme weather, and the ocean acidification causing diseases in the sea population. Atlantis is attacked by Black Manta, who takes the kingdom's orichalcum reserves to power his ancient Atlantean machines restored by Shin, injures Mera, and proves himself capable of fighting Arthur in equal terms. Reconvening with his mother Atlanna and Mera's father Nereus, Arthur discovers that David is behind the rising temperatures, as he went after all the hidden reserves of orichalcum, which emits high quantities of greenhouse gases and nearly caused a planetary extinction when used by an ancient Atlantean kingdom. Arthur decides that the way to find out where the Black Manta is hidden is going after one of David's allies, Arthur's half-brother Orm Marius, held captive by the Fisherman kingdom for having killed their king. Arthur breaks out Orm from prison, and after a meeting with crime lord Kingfish discovers David is based on a south Pacific volcanic island. Arriving in the island, Arthur and Orm discover monstrous fauna and flora that had been mutated by an orichalcum furnace where Black Manta's base is located. Before Atlantis attacks and destroys the island, Orm gets hold of the black trident and has visions revealing its creator was Kordax, the brother of Atlantis founder King Atlan and ruler of the lost kingdom of Necrus, that wound up sealed in an icy prison after losing a war with Atlantis. Given the seal was created by Atlan with blood magic, the blood of any of his descendants could release Kordax, leading David to attack Tom Curry's lighthouse and kidnap Arthur Jr. before heading to Necrus's hiding place, that the Atlanteans discover with Shin's help to be underneath the ice of Antarctica. In Necrus, Arthur attacks David to stop him from injuring Arthur Jr., and David almost defeats Arthur before Orm arrives and disarms him of the black trident. As Orm gets hold of the trident, the spirit of Kordax leaves David for Orm, who proceeds to fight Arthur and use his blood to thaw the ice imprisoning the body of Kordax. With his half-brother freed, Arthur throws the black trident at Kordax, who catches it in mid-air, before throwing his own trident to destroy the black trident and fatally impale Kordax. With Kordax's magic vanishing, Necrus starts to collapse, and as David hangs from a fissure, he refuses Arthur's help and throws himself down the cliff to his death. The Atlanteans and Shin escape to safety, and Arthur and Mera decide to let Orm go and tell the rest of Atlantis that he died, on the condition he remains hidden. Arthur decides that uniting land and sea is necessary to combat climate change, and reveals Atlantis to the human world through an announcement to the United Nations, with the intent of making the underwater kingdom a member state."

    "Arabesque": "Professor Ragheeb (George Coulouris) is taken aback that his regular optometrist is not working, Sloane (John Merivale), a man who he has never met, is taking his regular optometrist's place. During the eye examination, Sloane places drops in Ragheeb's eyes, blinding him in pain after a few seconds. After Ragheeb collapses and dies on the floor, Sloane takes off Ragheeb's glasses, and breaks them open to reveal a small piece of paper with drawings - seemingly hieroglyphics - on it.\n\nAt Oxford, Professor David Pollock (Gregory Peck), an American, has taken over an absent Professor Ragheeb's class on ancient hieroglyphics. David shouts out the word sex to wake up one of his sleeping students, Fanshaw (Gordon Griffin). At the end of the class, David is approached by Sloane, now referring to himself as Major Sylvester Pennington Sloane, a supposedly retired British military man now working as the private secretary for Middle Eastern shipping magnate, Nejim Beshraavi (Alan Badel), who would like to see him immediately on a lucrative business matter. David politely declines without knowing the specifics as he has regular plans for his Wednesdays.\n\nDavid is out for a jog when he is kidnapped and forced into a Rolls-Royce limousine. He is taken aback by what just happened, until he notices that one of the men in the limo is Hassan Jena (Carl Duering), the Prime Minister of the Middle Eastern country where Beshraavi lives. David is in awe of Jena. The other man in the back of the limo is Mohammed Lufti (Harold Kasket), Jena's ambassador to Great Britain. Jena asks David to accept Beshraavi's offer so that he can find out what exactly Beshraavi's plans are specifically with some opposition to Jena's government policies. In doing this task, David is not to tell anyone he has met Jena, or that Jena is already in Great Britain. There is also some personal risk to David as Beshraavi is a dangerous man. Regardless, David accepts the assignment due to his admiration for Jena.\n\nDavid meets with Beshraavi in a luxurious house in London, Beshraavi has a menacing presence including a peregrine falcon. Beshraavi asks David to decode a Hittite inscription - the piece of paper Sloane removed from Ragheeb's glasses - for a payment of $30,000. It should take David no more than a few hours, but Beshraavi gives David a veiled threat that he will be a prisoner at the house until the job is complete.\n\nIn the library of the house, David is eating individually wrapped candies while he works on decoding the cipher. An exotically beautiful woman who David does not know, enters the room unannounced. She is Yasmin Azir (Sophia Loren), the owner of the house and Beshraavi's lover. Beshraavi, who later enters, infers that David can look but not touch with regard to Yasmin, with whom he was immediately infatuated.\n\nThere are four at the dinner table: Beshraavi, Yasmin, David and an English businessman named Beauchamp (Ernest Clark). As Yasmin accidentally knocks over a tray, she secretly slips David a few pieces of paper. David accidentally reveals those papers when he drops them on his plate and Beshraavi wants to know what they are. David lies and says it is a prescription and is able to conceal their contents, not wanting to get Yasmin into trouble. David immediately excuses himself, followed closely by Yasmin. Beauchamp and Beshraavi now alone together, Beauchamp remarks that Prime Minister Jena's signing of a business treaty with the British in two days will ruin Beshraavi's shipping business, as it gives the shipping rights to British and American firms. Beshraavi in turn, says that the treaty will not be signed as told to him by a dependable soothsayer.\n\nAlone in a bathroom in the house, David reads the two pieces of paper slipped to him by Yasmin, one a news clipping about Professor Ragheeb's accidental death, the other a note from Yasmin asking him to meet her in her bedroom. As David meets Yasmin in her expansive en-suite and she turns on the shower just in case they could be overheard, Yasmin tells David that Beshraavi had Ragheeb killed, and will do the same to David once he decodes the cipher. Their conversation is interrupted as Beshraavi tries to get into the en-suite. As David hides in the shower stall with the water still running, Yasmin lets Beshraavi in. Yasmin and Beshraavi talk about issues such as David's work, and the cipher. Not to arouse Beshraavi's suspicions, Yasmin is forced to take her shower, exposing her naked self to David. Sloane then telephones Yasmin's bedroom phone telling Bashraavi that David and the cipher are missing. Overhearing that conversation from the en-suite, Yasmin confirms from David that he has the cipher in his possession. To hide it and without telling Yasmin, he wraps it in one of the candy wrappers he has been eating, a red wrapper with the number \"9\", which he places in his pocket among some other candy. As some in Beshraavi's employ go searching for David through the house, Beshraavi demonstrates to one of Yasmin's employees, Hemsley (Jimmy Gardner) that he can buy people for their loyalty or else exact extreme revenge. From that encounter, Hemsley tells Beshraavi that he saw David earlier come into this bedroom. Forced to show himself, David and Yasmin emerge from the en-suite, David seemingly abducting her at scissor-point. They escape together, with one of Beshraavi's henchmen, Mustapha (Larry Taylor), on their trail. That chase takes them to the Zoological Gardens, where among other things Mustapha shoots an aquarium, breaking the glass and emptying the fish inside. Eventually, Mustapha and David get into a struggle, when a man appears from behind and drowns Mustapha. He identifies himself as Inspector Webster (Duncan Lamont) with CID, he who had placed Yasmin's house under surveillance. When a gardens guard approaches asking about who they are and who will pay for the damages, Webster shoots him. Because of this act, David surmises that Webster is not CID, and can't be working for either Beshraavi or Jena. It is then that Webster reveals that he is working with Yasmin and slugs David on the back of the head with his pistol.\n\nDavid awakens in the back of a moving panel van after being knocked unconscious by Webster back at the gardens. Webster and Yasmin are now with another man, who is in a loving embrace with Yasmin, identifying himself as Yussef Kassim. All he wants to know is where the cipher is. David, seeing that they have emptied out his pockets of the candies with the cipher which are now on a shelf in the van, tells Yussef that Beshraavi has the cipher. They decide to use truth serum on David, after which, in a drugged stupor, he talks what they believe is gibberish about candy and the number \"9\". Believing that he was telling the truth and that Beshraavi has the cipher, Yussef tells Yasmin to work on Beshraavi to find out where it is, while they dump David out of the moving van in the middle of the highway. Still in a hallucinatory drugged state, David is almost killed several times over as he believes he's a bullfighter and the passing cars are bulls. Eventually, he stumbles across a bicycle and cycles away after causing traffic chaos.\n\nThe next morning, Yasmin arrives back home to Beshraavi's loving embrace. They talk about why David took her hostage - she explaining that it was to escape from Beshraavi's threats to keep him a prisoner at the house until the job was complete - and both David and Mustapha having been killed at Yussef's hands. In the discussion, Yasmin implies that Beshraavi stole the cipher, which was intended for Yussef from Ragheeb, and that Yussef does not yet know the coded message. While Yasmin tells him that neither David or Yussef have the cipher, Beshraavi states that he doesn't have it. He also states that David is not dead, but was seen alive arriving back home on bicycle. Yasmin also tells him that Yussef kept her alive as he thinks she is working with him to get the cipher from Beshraavi. Believing David still has the cipher, Beshraavi sends Yasmin to get it from him as he believes her feminine methods would work better on David than Sloane's more violent ones.\n\nAt David's apartment, he, still groggy from the drugs, is awoken by the telephone ringing. It is Jena, to who David tells that he doesn't know what's going on with Beshraavi yet, and that he does not have the cipher. Despite his near death encounters, David is re-inspired after speaking to Jena. At the end of their conversation, Yasmin bursts into the apartment. Incredulous that she would show up after doing nothing while watching him almost get killed by her \"boyfriend\" Yussef, Yasmin is able to convince him that she hates Yussef and that the only reason she is in cahoots with him is that his boss, a general back home named Ali orchestrating a military takeover, has her mother and sisters hostage and will kill them if she doesn't cooperate. Likewise, she is only being friendly to Beshraavi on Yussef's orders. She is then able to convince him that what he needs to do is break the code of the cipher so that she can report that information back to the embassy, which will ensure both their safeties. It is then that both realize that neither has the cipher, and that it is likely still in the back of the van.\n\nDavid and Yasmin go to the construction site Yussef uses as his front. They spot the van. Before they can get to it, they see Yussef and Webster heading for the van. Before the two men leave, Webster, hungry, takes all the candy including the one in which David wrapped the cipher. Following Webster as he eats one candy after another, they pick up the discarded wrappers, to see if it is the red number 9 with the cipher. Some of the wrappers are more difficult to get to than others. They watch Webster eat the red wrapped number 9 candy and spot the cipher inside. He goes to a telephone booth to make a call, looking the number up in the telephone booth, meaning that the call is not to Yussef, whose number he already knows. Going to the booth after Webster has left, they see he has scribbled \"3:30\" underneath the listing for Beshraavi Shipping, meaning that Webster has joined forces with Beshraavi and will be meeting him at 3:30. Knowing Beshraavi's routine, Yasmin knows where their meeting place will be.\n\nAt Ascot race track, a decked out Yasmin is with Beshraavi, while a dapper David is looking for Webster. David and Yasmin are able to talk briefly to make plans to meet at 9 o'clock that evening at Trafalgar Square after David gets the cipher from Webster. David spots Webster rendezvousing with Sloane, to who he will hand over the cipher. David is able to poke the paper out of Webster's hand with his umbrella, the paper flying in the air and landing in the middle of the horse track with the horses in a race approaching. As David and Webster scuffle with each other, Sloane pulls out a blade to stab David. He misses and instead stabs Webster dead who grabs David's name tag as David escapes. David risks his life by running out onto the track to retrieve the cipher. He is able to do so just before the horses gallop by, David running away with cipher in hand. This entire situation is visible not only to the entire crowd but more specifically Yasmin and Beshraavi who are watching with binoculars.\n\nOn a train, David is tracing a copy of the cipher, but still has not been able to decode it. After he completes the copy, he places the original into a self-addressed stamped envelope which he posts immediately after getting off the train. There, he sees the headlines of the newspaper, which names him as Webster's murderer. He telephones Jena for help in this matter, Jena offers none except for the advice to stay clear of the police, which David does as he notices a bobby heading toward the telephone booth.\n\nYasmin and Beshraavi are back at her house, and he has bought her several pairs of new shoes. As he helps her try on each pair caressing her legs in the process, they discuss what happened at Ascot. He believes this situation is perfect as she can get close to David, find out what decoded message is from him, and bring that information back to Beshraavi. Beshraavi threatens her in the process, implying that he will kill her if she doesn't succeed.\n\nDavid goes to Ragheeb's house, wanting to speak to his widow (Malya Nappi) as he figures that Ragheeb, who was murdered because of the cipher, may have told her what the decoded message is, or at least mentioned where he got it or have some notes somewhere among his possessions about it. He tells her of Ragheeb's death being murder by Beshraavi. Looking at the copy of the cipher, Ragheeb's widow tears it up in frustration, she finally implies that she knew that Ragheeb was working on something dangerous. David also tells her that he is working with Yasmin, her mother and sisters in danger at the hands of General Ali. On this news, Ragheeb's widow states that Yasmin is lying in that she has no mother or sisters, only a father who happens to be General Ali himself.\n\nAt 9 o'clock that night at Trafalgar Square, David hops into Yasmin's just arrived car and they drive off. They are being tailed by one of Beshraavi's men, but Yasmin is able to lose him. Yasmin, grateful that David is still alive and not in jail, tells him of her discussion with Beshraavi. She asks directly if he still has the cipher. He responds that he no longer needs it as he has decoded the message and makes up a lie based on a billboard sign for Vesta matches he says the cipher is \"The plague shall not pass until the swans fly high in the kingdom of Vesta\". He says he has done his job, he not needing to know what the message actually means. Rather than she dropping him off for his own safety while she goes to the embassy to report the information, he convinces her that it would be safer for him to stay with her, and that she can telephone the information to the embassy at a pay phone, which she does. She in turn convinces him that she does have to go to the embassy to deal with the aftermath, so he that he needs to find his own way from here as the police at the embassy would arrest him on sight. Following their arrangement to meet at the Knightsbridge Hotel where he lies that he is staying, he gets out of the car and she drives away, but he flags down a taxi to follow her. They follow her to Yussef's construction site, she obviously having telephoned him to arrange this meeting. However, hiding in the shadows, David can see Yasmin looking for Yussef in the building, and can see Yussef operating the wrecking ball, he who is planning to kill Yasmin with it. David rushes to save her, just before the wrecking ball comes crashing to where she was standing. Yussef, with wrecking ball, has the two of them on the run through the semi-demolished building, with one near miss after another. David eventually is able to maneuver himself to a spot where the wrecking ball hits an electrical power source, sending a major jolt of electricity through the wrecking ball machine to its cab, electrocuting Yussef to death.\n\nAs David and Yasmin drive off, they argue, David mad at her for lying about going to the embassy and lying about her mother and sisters, he having got the truth from Ragheeb's widow. Yasmin then figures out why Yussef lured her to the construction site. She tells David that Ragheeb's widow is in cahoots with Yussef, Mrs. Ragheeb who lied to David about Yasmin's family and she who telephoned Yussef to tell him that Yasmin was double crossing him. Once again believing that Yasmin is telling the truth, David confesses that the story he told her of the decoded message was made up, and that he has not yet decoded it.\n\nAt David's hotel room, David has worked through the night trying to decode the cipher, while Yasmin has been asleep in the bed. He wakes her up with a loving kiss when he has figured it out. It is not Hittite hieroglyphics as he initially believed it to be but rather a simple children's code. The decoded message is the nursery rhyme \"goosee goosee gander\", which is probably a red herring for something else. Remembering that Ragheeb's widow tore up a copy of the cipher upon seeing it, David finally realizes that it is not the drawings themselves, but rather something else on the original piece of paper which contains the message. Retrieving the original from the Hammersmith post office where he mailed it, David, in Yasmin's car while she is driving, tries several theories before he hits the jackpot: the cipher was written with dissoluble ink, which leaves the message remaining after dissolved. What remains is a microdot, which when under a microscope reveals, \"Beshraavi plans assassinate Jena twelve thirty June eighteenth\", which is in twenty minutes time. They don't know where to go until Yasmin sees on a newscast that Jena has just landed at the airport. Facing road obstacles, David and Yasmin are able to make it to the airport a few minutes before 12:30. They, however, have problems trying to gain access to the press conference currently taking place. In the background, Jena, who has just been asked by a reporter about the business treaty he is about to sign with the British government, states that he will not be signing the treaty upon review of its contents. Fighting the police and the crowd, David is able to get to Jena and knock him to the ground, when bullets, from Sloane's machine gun, land where Jena was just standing. Jena is grateful to David for saving his life, David in turn telling him that the coded message stated that Beshraavi was going to kill him. Shocked, Jena asks to speak to David in private. Then, Lufti, as Jena is trying to make his way into a private room, shoots Jena dead. Yasmin whisks David off among the melee. She tries to convince him that the man who was just shot is not Jena. David is incredulous to this as he tells her that he knows Jena, has met him, and talked to him several times in the last few days. Yasmin, who now knows the entire picture of David's involvement, knows now that Beshraavi hired this man to impersonate Jena to David, without Beshraavi disclosing to the impostor that it would be a suicide mission. What tipped Yasmin to he not being Jena was that there was no recognition on his face of who she was, she who is a spy working for the real Jena.\n\nMaking their way to a surveillance truck monitoring all of Jena's movement upon landing, Yasmin asks to see all the footage shot thus far. Reviewing that footage, Yasmin figures that the switch was made in the car transferring Jena from the plane to the terminal, as he was no longer wearing his trademark slippers after emerging from the window darkened car. Rushing off to where the car is located, they notice a large trunk being transferred from the car to a truck, they figuring Jena being inside the trunk. Yasmin figures Beshraavi needed the fake Jena to denounce the treaty before being killed in order to save his shipping business. Able to slip in the back of the truck as it takes off, David and Yasmin open the locked trunk to find the real Jena inside, bound and gagged but otherwise all right. The truck is headed to Yasmin's house and a waiting Beshraavi. The trunk removed from the truck, David, Yasmin and Jena are able to hide inside the truck while Beshraavi and his men transport the trunk to the house. Beshraavi, however, notices that the trunk's lock is broken. Suspicious, he orders the trunk to be opened right then and there, to find it devoid of Jena. By that time, David, Yasmin and Jena are able to run from the truck but are spotted off in the distance. A chase ensues, first through a low wheat field, where David, Yasmin and Jena are attacked by Beshraavi's men in various harvesting machines, one whose thrashing blades almost kill the three. Arriving at the stables, the three are able to secure some horses and ride away being chased by a Jeep. They escape the vehicle by crossing a stream but Beshraavi and Sloane among others are following them in a helicopter with machine guns in hand. When the three arrive at a bridge, It is blocked at the far end amend David figures they have better cover on foot among the bridge's structure. Beshraavi and Sloane are able to get some shots on the three as they race across the bridge, the helicopter making pass after pass underneath the bridge span. Getting to the mid span, the three are forced to stop due to construction work on the bridge. David, standing up to grab a construction site ladder, is an open target for Beshraavi and Sloane's next pass, who end up missing David. As the helicopter makes its pass right underneath them on the bridge span, David drops the ladder into the helicopter's rotor. Disabled, the helicopter crashes below them into a burning blaze.\n\nDavid and Yasmin are in a romantic mood as they float leisurely in a flatboat on a the water. Oblivious to what is going on around them as they kiss and embrace, they crash into another boat. The male of the male/female couple in the row boat is angry at David, that is until he sees that it is Professor Pollock, the other man being his \"sleeping\" student, Fanshaw. To get the out of their crashed predicament, David uses a pole jabbed into the lake bottom to push off. He pushes too hard, leaving himself suspended on the pole away from the boat. David tells Yasmin he can't swim as he falls into the water. Concerned, Yasmin jumps in to save him. \"Swimming\" David emerges from the water, he telling her that it was his turn to lie. They embrace in the water."

    "Aranmanai 2": "The movie starts with the Amman statue, which was guarding the village against evil spirits and negative energy, being moved into an underground room during the temple's renovation. At a graveyard somewhere close to the temple, a group of tantric practitioners capitalise on the Amman being made dormant to awaken evil spirits for black magic purposes. During the ritual, they inadvertently release a demonic entity that they could not contain. The evil spirit then leaves the graveyard in the form of a cloud and moves into the village. The village mendicant-holy man notices the evil spirit and chases after it, but could not prevent it from entering the titular palace. Being mute, his pleadings to warn the palace owner are ignored. Later that night, the spirit attacks the owner who then falls and goes into a coma. His elder son Ramesh arrives with his wife Sandhya and their son Suresh. Together with them are his younger brother, Murali and his fianc\u00e9e Anitha. Devadas arrives as well, in disguise as his father, Sandhu Bondu Naadimuthu who was a doctor and had contact with the landowners.\n\nOne night the family driver is killed. After a few nights, Suresh does crazy things and says that someone is telling him to do so. Also, Murali sees his father being elevated above the bed and gets scared. Anitha, who also sees these things, decides to call her brother, Ravi. One night Ravi sees Suresh drowning and rescues him. He initially suspects Manju, who was hired by the family as a nurse for Murali's father, but he soon realizes it is not her since she has a different agenda. After that, he sets up cameras around the house. A couple of nights later the elder brother goes missing and Ravi sees it. With the cameras, he is able to identify the spirit that is causing havoc. Murali identifies her as Maya, his younger sister.\n\nMaya was loved by all, especially by her father and Murali. She was also the owner of Maya Granites shown in the song Maya Maya. On the day before her marriage, she eloped with one of the workers' sons and the whole family was shocked and felt disgraced. Three years later in Bangalore, when Murali sees that she is pregnant, he passes the good news to his father and brother as they arrive at their house. Their father asks Maya to come back home to which she agrees. On the day she was supposed to arrive, Maya didn't show up, and Murali thought she had changed her mind. Later Ravi tells that it's not true. Maya and her husband got off a stop earlier since her elder brother wanted them to arrive home safely. While travelling in a Jeep on the way to their palace, Maya's husband was stabbed by the driver. After that, he instructed Maya to go into hiding. But this plan failed when Maya's father arrived and told her to drink poison since she disgraced her family's name and status by marrying someone who belonged to a lower caste. Maya agrees to her father's words with a condition that her husband's life should be spared. After she drank the poison, Maya's elder brother killed her husband in front of her which made Maya vow that she will end the male generation in her family before her father chokes her to death. Ravi also tells that her primary target is Murali since he told their father and elder brother about her whereabouts and also Suresh. Manju tells that her uncle is a priest and lives near the Kerala border.\n\nRavi goes with Manju to the priest whose disciples at first refused to offer a helping hand because the priest is just recuperating from myocardial infarction (heart attack). But before they leave, the priest decides to help them and starts the pooja. After a few moments, the priest informs that Maya has possessed someone in the palace and it is revealed to be Anitha. It is also shown that Anitha killed Murali's elder brother and also poisons her father-in-law as an act of revenge, even though he managed to recover from his coma. Ravi decides to find Maya's corpse, while Murali, Suresh, and Manju try to distract Anitha by taking the entire family to a restaurant. Their main goal is to get Anitha's blood and put some holy ink on her hair. They manage to get her blood when she is cutting an apple, and one of the assistants manages to put the ink before getting thrashed by Anitha/Maya. There Anitha goes to the house and tries to kill Murali and Suresh. However, it fails and the priest manages to get Maya out of Anitha. Later Ravi and the priest decide to kill the spirit and the only way is to be possessed by the spirit and stab its own corpse. Ravi manages to do it and completes it but the priest gets chest pain and he tells Murali that their only hope is to go to the Amman Pooja that is happening in their village temple as Amman is their final hope. Murali and Suresh get there with Ravi possessed by Maya trying to stop them. When Ravi is about to kill Murali, Amman uses her powers and prevents Maya's spirit from killing Murali and Suresh. Before she leaves, she sees her brother Murali who sheds tears for what had happened to his beloved sister. Before Maya disappears she smiles at Amman. After this incident, Murali, Suresh and Anitha reunite and Ravi reunites with Manju leaving the Aranmanai in the hands of the caretakers. As everyone leaves the palace, Maya's spirit enters a doll and returns to the palace waiting for the right time to swing back into action. The movie ends with a hint of a sequel."

Government authorities have been searching to shut down the operation, but to no avail. David Lord (Lutz), a fireman and paramedic gets into a terrible car accident with his pregnant wife, Lori (Nina Dobrev), who does not survive the crash. Grief-stricken, David considers suicide, but decides against it. Later he drowns his sorrows at a local bar, while a mysterious woman, Milla, watches him from afar. After witnessing him easily subdue the bar's bouncer, Milla seduces David before incapacitating him and allowing him to be kidnapped.\n\nMilla, it turns out, is a recruiter for The Deathgames, which is run by the confident Logan (Jackson) and his two sexy assistants Kaneko (Irene Choi) and Kawaii (Lauren Shiohama). Kaden (Messner), the executioner is doubtful of the fighting ability of a mere \"doctor.\" David is locked in a small cell and befriends a fellow fighter in the cell next to his, Taiga (Kim), who tells him that he was coerced into participating due to a threat on his wife's life. David reluctantly wins his first fight, and Milla becomes more invested in his success (as she gets paid when he wins). Logan tells David that he will set him free if he wins ten fights in a row.\n\nIn order to persuade David to fight again, Kaden reveals that Taiga's wife is in their hands and will be killed if he fails to win his next fight. After David wins, it is revealed that his opponent was Taiga, who was given the same task for his wife. Remorsefully, David kills Taiga, but not before incurring serious wounds of his own. It is then, that David officially accepts Logan's offer, on one the condition: the tenth and final opponent must be Kaden himself. Milla begins to feel bad for David after seeing how badly he is hurt and personally attends to his wounds. She becomes closer to him as he fights his next few fights and has him moved to a more comfortable room with more space and a bed. She brings him food and women. After each fight she personally addresses his wounds. Eventually she realizes her attraction to him and Milla and David make love.\n\nFor the penultimate fight, Kaden arranges for the release of an international serial killer named Brutus Jackson, which leads Logan to believe that Kaden is afraid of David. Before the fight, David tells Milla to contact his brother Sam, who he hasn't seen since the car accident. She does so, but Sam doesn't seem to want to hear from David. David defeats Brutus in brutal fight, and Logan is distressed. Logan has a doctor create a serum to inject into David, which will slow him down and make him an easy victim for Kaden in their fight.\n\nLarge crowds watch online as Kaden initially pummels David, but much to Logan's surprise, David begins to gain the heavy advantage. As they fight, it is revealed through flash backs that \"David Lord\" is the assumed named of a secret government agent who was specifically sent to infiltrate The Deathgames. The phone call to \"Sam\" was in order to alert his superior, Agent McCarty (James Remar) about his location via phone tracing. It is also revealed that Milla secretly switched Logan's serum with a simple saline solution prior to the fight. A group of soldiers invade the facility and arrest Milla, Kaneko, and Kawaii. Filled with rage after defeating Kaden, David hunts down Logan and corners him in a stockroom. As David is about to strike the deadly blow, soldiers arrive, snapping David out of his murderous fury. Logan escapes.\n\nAgent McCarty consoles David as he deals with the fact that he had to kill so many people and assures him that Logan will be caught. Milla apologizes to David as she is escorted away, and McCarty assures David that she is in good hands."

    "Argylle": "The film opens in Greece, where suave British spy Aubrey Argylle (Henry Cavill) prepares to move in on his target, a terrorist named LaGrange (Dua Lipa). After a brief dance together, LaGrange has her assassins draw their guns on Argylle. He then contacts his partner Keira (Ariana DeBose), who uses her tech to find a way for Argylle to get out. LaGrange then corners Argylle and Keira outside and fires at them, hitting Keira in the chest. As Argylle tries to save her, he contacts his other associate, Wyatt (John Cena), to catch LaGrange before she can escape. Wyatt catches her, and he and Argylle interrogate LaGrange to learn who her employer is. It turns out she is working for Fowler (Richard E. Grant), the director who also employed Argylle and Wyatt. LaGrange poisons herself before she can be brought in, and Argylle now wonders who he can really trust.\n\nThe scene shifts to a book reading by Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), author of the \"Argylle\" book series that the character originates from, as the entire scene was from the last chapter of the fourth book in the series. After answering some questions, she later goes to her private cabin with her pet cat Alfie so that she can begin to write the fifth book. She spends the evening writing the whole thing, thinking she has completed it before going to bed.\n\nIn the morning, Elly is contacted by her mother Ruth (Catherine O'Hara), who spent all night reading the manuscript Elly sent her. Ruth says the book is good, but she doesn't like the ending, calling it a \"copout\". Elly then starts trying to write another new chapter to try and give the book better closure. She envisions several scenarios to give Argylle a better ending, but she finds herself drawing a blank.\n\nElly decides to take a train with Alfie to visit Ruth in Chicago when she suggests to help Elly finish the book. On the train, she is approached by a man named Aiden Wilde (Sam Rockwell). He pretends to be a fan of Elly's before informing her there are people on the train who are targeting her. Moments later, a \"fan\" comes by with a knife disguised as a pen, forcing Aiden to jump into action and start fighting assassins while Elly tries to hide, though she visualizes Argylle himself in Aiden's place. One of the assassins is a man named Carlos (Tomas Paredes), whom Elly recognizes from the book reading as a supposed fan. Aiden then takes Elly to the end of the train where he blasts the doors off and parachutes with her (and Alfie) out of the train, where she passes out midair.\n\nWhen Elly wakes up, Aiden has cut his hair and reveals he took her to a cabin. He informs her that the assassins come from a sinister organization called The Division, led by Director Ritter (Bryan Cranston). They believe that Elly's books predict certain events in their line of work, and they have already read her manuscript for Book Five and are waiting on her to write the final chapter. Ritter is shown executing his Deputy Director (Rob Delaney) for failing to apprehend Elly and reacquiring a Master File that can expose all agents of The Division. Furthermore, the character of Wyatt is based off of Aiden, while Keira was a real person who apparently really did die.\n\nAiden brings Elly (and Alfie) along with him to find an informant named Bakunin (Stanley Morgan), who was going to deliver the Master File to him. Hoping to get an idea of where to find Bakunin, Aiden convinces Elly to start writing the next chapter, which Ritter and his men listen in on because some fans record Elly on their phones.\n\nThe duo are led to an apartment supposedly belonging to Bakunin. They find nothing but an opening under the floorboards, where Aiden finds a book with information written by Bakunin. Soon, Division assassins start making their way toward the building, leading to Elly and Aiden hiding under the floorboards. After a while, Aiden springs out from underneath to start killing the assassins. Before more start coming, the two make their way to the roof and jump off onto a dumpster below.\n\nAiden brings Elly to his place in London for safety. He goes into the bathroom and talks to his employer with the shower running, and Elly overhears Aiden saying that she \"needs a bullet in her head\". Fearing for her life, she grabs Alfie and contacts Ruth so that she can go to Chicago herself (with Alfie). Upon arriving, Elly rejoins Ruth before her father arrives...and it turns out to be RITTER. He starts going through Elly's stuff before Aiden arrives, telling Elly that these two are not her parents. After Ritter drops the dad act, Ruth (whose real name is Margaret Vogler) pulls a gun (and a British accent) on Elly. Aiden shoots her and knocks Ritter out before getting a horrified Elly out, unfortunately leaving Alfie behind.\n\nAiden escorts Elly to meet his employer, Alfred \"Alfie\" Solomon (Samuel L. Jackson). Here, Elly learns \"the real Agent Argylle\" is none other than...ELLY HERSELF! Her books were not predictions, but rather memories of her past life as a spy. Her real name is Rachel Kylle (Agent R. Kylle), and she lost her memory after a mission gone wrong. Ritter and Vogler got to Rachel before Aiden could, and they posed as her parents, making her believe she was always an aspiring writer so that she can document her thoughts down and eventually bring her down. They were hoping for the latest book to reveal the location of the Master File. Elly is bewildered at the revelation until Aiden engages her in combat, and she is able to utilize her skills from memory to neutralize him.\n\nSolomon tells Elly and Aiden that the Master File is in the possession of a Division associate named Saba Al-Badr/The Keeper (Sofia Boutella). The pair travel to Arabia, where Elly must become Rachel once again. While waiting to speak to Saba at her compound, Aiden starts dancing with Elly, saying that they used to be romantically involved. Saba sees Elly alone and talks to her, where she acts well enough as Rachel for Saba to give her the Master File.\n\nThe Division manages to track down Elly and Aiden, capturing them and bringing them on board their large ship. Elly had just learned that she herself was an asset of The Division. A flashback reveals that she had killed Bakunin before taking the Master File, and the explosion triggered by his apartment self-destructing led to her memory loss. In order to save herself, Elly shoots Aiden in the chest to make Ritter think she is on their side. She also has to pretend that she doesn't care for Alfie, who is in Ritter's custody. In reality, she shot him in a specific area so that the bullet would go through his chest but missing the heart, with survival being dependent on stopping the bleeding soon enough, something that Elly got from a fan theory on how Keira could have been brought back. Aiden gets free and kills his captors before going to help Elly.\n\nElly sees one last hallucination of Argylle, telling her that she never needed him to do what he could do, before she takes on Carlos and his goons, who have to stop with the gunfire after crude oil starts to leak out. Elly then remembers one of her memories being ice-skating, so she straps some blades to her shoes and slides across the oil, slicing through the assassins before fighting Carlos, ending with her throwing a knife into his heart. She shoots the rest of the assassins before she and Aiden take out every last villain on the ship as a couple, with plenty of flair. They make it to the ship's control room to send the Master File to Solomon, but Ritter aims his rifle at them. Alfie then lunges toward the villain and begins to claw at his face, giving Aiden a chance to shoot and kill Ritter. Unfortunately, Alfie clawed out his eyes, as a retinal scan was needed to complete the upload, but Aiden finds an alternate way.\n\nThe duo begin uploading the file to Solomon, but Vogler shows up with a music box that mind-controls Elly to try and kill Aiden, which also makes her put the upload on hold. Aiden fights Elly reluctantly, nearly dying until a masked assailant hops onto the ship and brains Vogler with a wrench, causing her to drop the music box, which shatters upon hitting the floor and severs Elly's mind control. The assailant is Keira, who survived her gunshot wound the same way Aiden survived his, because it turns out Keira was the one who suggested the theory to Elly. The three (and Alfie) send the rest of the Master File and leave the ship to blow up, killing Vogler and anyone else left alive. Elly and Aiden also finally kiss.\n\nElly returns to her author role and finishes Book Five, giving Argylle a proper happy ending. She goes back to the book store for another reading, and a fan asks her what happened to the characters after the story. Elly says that, \"hypothetically\", Solomon received high honors from the CIA for exposing The Division, while Keira went to rise up in the tech field, and Elly and Aiden appear to be together. Before Elly ends things, another fan who looks much like a nerdier version of Elly's image of Argylle stands to ask a question, but also suggesting Elly might have questions for him, leaving her surprised.\n\nDuring the credits, a flashback to 20 years earlier is shown. A young Argylle (Louis Partridge) enters a pub and seems to be working with the Kingsman agency (they exist in the same universe). Text then appears saying \"Argylle: Book One\", as a film adaptation of Elly's first novel is said to be coming soon."

    "Arjun: The Warrior Prince": "The story is based on the early life of the Prince Arjuna (Yuddvir Bakolia), loosely taken from the ancient Indian epic Mahabharata. The story-line begins with Arjun as a nine-year-old boy and follows him until he grows into the warrior that the world knows him as. It explores his life with his brothers in Hastinapur, his training and education, and his ultimate discovery of the warrior within himself.\n\nThe movie begins with Uttar, the young prince of Viratnagar (Kingdom of king Virata), asking a maid (Brihannala) to tell him a story. The maid narrates him the story of Arjun. Pandu was the King of Hastinapur. He left the Kingdom to his brother Dhritrashtra and went to the forest for penance, with his 2 wives. With the blessing of the Gods, he had 5 sons. Pandu dies after that and Kunti (Ila Arun) (the elder wife) brings the kids back to Hastinapur, while the 2nd wife Satis. The Prime Minister delivers the kids to the ashram of Guru Drona.\n\nArjun was a student of Drona (Ravi Khanwilkar), and that he learned the art of warfare from him. He was more skilled than all the students of Drona. None of his own brothers, nor his cousins - the hundred Kauravas - could equal him in the art. Duryodhana and the other Kauravas despised the Pandavas, for they feared that they might usurp Duryodhana's throne. Duryodhana had a rivalry with Bheem (Ashok Banthia) and tries to kill him several times by poisoning him or throwing his unconscious body into deep river waters. But Bheem survives. At the royal tournament, Duryodhan props up Karna to face and challenge Arjun as the best archer of the world. Arjun is a kid but wants to face Karna. Drona intervenes and stop this by saying that Karna is not eligible to fight Arjun. Bheeshma (Vishnu Sharma) advises Dhritrashtra not to do injustice to Yudhishthira, in his love for his own son. Else war is inevitable.\n\nWhen the king Dhritrashtra grew older, the rivalry between his sons the Kauravas and the Pandavas intensified. Twice, Duryodhana (Hemant Mahaur) attempted to kill all the Pandavas but failed. One time by sanctioning a tribal Susharman to build a combustible palace for his cousins at Varnavrat. But the Pandavas manage to escape the raging fire. Bheem finds and kills some of the tribal. In the meantime, Arjun won a Swayamvar (Arjun and Bheem heard about it from a travelling group of ascetics. Yudhishthira thinks that Pandavas can challenge Duryodhana if Panchal King's army supports them), and married the daughter of the King of Panchala, Draupadi (Rajeshwari Sachdev). The Pandavas return to Hastinapur triumphant.\n\nTo avoid further conflict, Dhritrashtra proclaimed Duryodhana as the crown prince of Hastinapur, and asked Yudhishthira (Brijesh Jha) to be the king of a distant unkempt territory of the empire. Lord Krishna (Sachin Khedekar) meets the Pandavas in Khandavprastha and tells them to create a powerful kingdom with their hard work. They are attacked by Susharman and their tribal bandits, but Arjun and Krishna fend them off. The Pandavas construct a lavish Kingdom in the space of a few short years and invite the entire world for Yudhishthira's coronation.\n\nDuryodhana, who loathed the Pandavas, hatched a conspiracy with his uncle Shakuni (Vijay Kashyap) and won all that belonged to the Pandavas in a betting game called Chaupar. After losing everything, Yudhishthira bet his own brothers and Draupadi, and even himself. Draupadi was insulted in front of everyone, but Arjuna could not say anything because Yudhishthira was the king, and the king's words are the last words. Dhritrashtra feels Duryodhana went overboard and orders that the last dice be re-played with revised terms. The Pandavas, according to the rules of the game, had to go into exile for twelve years and an Agyatavasa for one year. While all the Pandavas go one way, Arjuna travels North to do Tapasya. Before leaving, Draupadi makes him promise that he will take revenge for her insult. He then leaves, and does Tapasya, during which he earns a bow from the Lord Shiva (Aanjjan Srivastav) after passing a series of test from him.\n\nThe story then shifts back to the present day Viratnagar. It is revealed that the Pandavas are spending their secret exile, or 'Agyatavasa', there, and are noticed by some of the spies of Duryodhana. According to the outcome of the game, if any one of the Pandavas is found before the end of that one year, the Pandavas will have to again go for a twelve-year exile. The spy informs Duryodhana that the Pandavas are in Viratnagar. So, he launches an attack on Viratnagar with the help of his bandit friends. The king of Viratnagar leaves to thrash the marauding bandits. However, that is the bait. From the other direction Duryodhana's army comes, and it seems that the young prince of Viratnagar is the only one who is left to fight.\n\nUttar's maid drives the young prince's chariot to the field, but the prince, distraught by the number of enemies, flees. The maid stops him and reveals her true identity: the maid (Brihannala) comes out as Arjun. Arjun retrieves his bow and makes prince Uttar drive his chariot. The warrior massacres the army and emerges victorious and at last Arjuna alone defeats all Kaurava warriors including Bhisma and Drona."

    "Armageddon": "While fixing a satellite in orbit, the Space Shuttle Atlantis is destroyed by a meteor shower, killing the entire crew. Meteorites then bombard New York City and several other parts of the world, and NASA discovers that an asteroid the size of Texas, traveling at 22,000 miles per hour, will collide with Earth in 18 days, effectively destroying the planet. The scientists at NASA - in cooperation with the Russian, Japanese and other European space agencies - plan to detonate a nuclear bomb at a precise point under the asteroid's surface which will split it in two and cause it to miss the Earth. However, the bombs must be planted at least 800 feet below the surface within eight hours of landing, and no later than four hours before the Earth impact. The mission is not revealed to the public, fearing panic.\n\nNASA locates Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis), because he could help them drill a hole on the asteroid. When invited to NASA, Harry brings his daughter Grace (Liv Tyler) to keep her away from A.J. (Ben Affleck), a young, rambunctious member of his crew who, he has just discovered, has been sleeping with her. This disappoints and infuriates Harry because he did not want his daughter to marry an oil driller like himself or remain in the blue-collar life. Head of NASA Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) informs Harry of the dire situation. Harry recognizes that he and his crew must accompany the astronauts to ensure the job is done properly. After Harry's crew (Jayotis \"Bear\" Kurleenbear, Max Lennert, Rockhound, Oscar Choice, Charles \"Chick\" Chapple and some others) is collected and NASA acquiesces to their demands, they are put through a 12-day training program and outfit a drilling rig with the proper equipment.\n\nAfter a meteorite strikes Shanghai, China, destroying the city and causing a tsunami, the incoming asteroid and pending mission are revealed to the world. Two military shuttles, Freedom and Independence, are launched and dock at a Russian space station (crewed by Lev Andropov) to refuel with liquid oxygen propellant. A.J. encounters a problem stopping the pumps after the ships' tanks are full and the station explodes. The crews and Lev Andropov escape. Later, the two shuttles perform a high G-force powered slingshot procedure around the Moon, traveling at 22,500 miles per hour to intercept the asteroid.\n\nAs they enter the asteroid's wake, the Independence is struck by debris and crash-lands on the asteroid, killing most of its crew, including Oscar Choice, Freddie Noonan and the Independence pilots. AJ, Lev and Bear survive. The Freedom lands on the surface but misses the target landing zone, arriving on an area of hard iron which will be difficult to drill through. The Freedom team tries to drill but suffers several setbacks and losses due to unexpected conditions.\n\nAfter losing communication with Earth, the mission is put on hold, as the bomb's timer is activated by orders from the United States President to ensure the mission succeeds. However, a surface explosion would not be sufficient to divert the asteroid. Harry convinces Colonel Sharp to deactivate the bomb and help them attempt to finish the job. With just 250 feet left to drill, their drilling machine is blasted off the asteroid by a gas vent killing Max in the process.\n\nWhen the crew radio report to NASA that the mission has failed, worldwide panic ensues as humanity braces for the end of the world. A massive meteoroid then strikes Paris, destroying most of the city. The Freedom crew learns that the other team managed to survive the crash thanks to Lev Andropov and A.J. and have driven the second drilling machine to the site. Harry puts A.J. in charge of finishing the drilling and they successfully drill to the necessary depth. The team lowers the nuclear bomb into the hole but are caught in a rock storm. The storm kills crew member Gruber and damages the remote on the bomb, rendering remote detonation useless.\n\nWith 18 minutes left, Truman tells the team that someone must stay behind to detonate the bomb. A.J. is chosen after drawing straws, but Harry disables A.J.'s air supply and takes his place. As the shuttle departs, Harry sends a message to his daughter, giving his full support for her to marry A.J. Harry detonates the bomb exactly at the deadline, causing the asteroid to split in two and miss the Earth by 400 miles, at the cost of his own life. The remaining crews of Freedom and Independence return to Earth as heroes.\n\nA.J. reunites with Grace while the others are met by their loved ones. Grace and A.J. soon marry, while Harry and the other lost crew members are memorialized."

    "Armed and Dangerous": "Officer Frank Dooley (John Candy), a 10-year veteran of the LAPD, is framed for the theft of a television set by two corrupt detectives (who Dooley had actually caught robbing an appliance store). He is dismissed from the force, but escapes criminal punishment at his day in court.\n\nThe next court case features hapless and nervous defense attorney named Norman Kane (Eugene Levy) attempting to defend a Charles Manson-type white supremacist cult leader named Lawrence Lupik (Glenn Withrow), who threatens to kill him should Kane fail to keep him out of prison. A fearful Kane reveals his ineptitude and the death threat to the judge (Stacy Keach, Sr.), who tells Kane that he will give Lupik \"A sentence so long he won't even remember his own name, let alone yours\" so long as Kane agrees to find another line of work with a \"lot less responsibility\".\n\nDooley and Kane meet for the first time when they both apply for work at Guard Dog Security, a low-rent firm run by the gruff \"Captain\" Clarence O'Connell (Kenneth McMillan) and part of a security guard's union requiring heavy $15 a week contributions that is represented by Clyde Klepper (Jonathan Banks) and Tony Lazarus (Brion James). Becoming licensed armed security guards after a single afternoon of training, Dooley and Kane are made partners by Guard Dog supervisor Maggie Cavanaugh (Meg Ryan) and assigned to night duty at the Carlex Pharmaceutical Company's warehouse.\n\nDuring their first night, after being loudly ordered to take a lunch break by senior guard Bruno (Tom Lister, Jr.), Kane happens upon an armed robbery of the warehouse and quickly calls over the radio to Frank for help, but they prove no match for the thieves (the robbers are Klepper and Lazarus in ski masks) who used machine guns. Kane unwittingly escapes into the \"Annex\" where Bruno had told them to stay away from as it was guarded by the K9 Patrol (Rottweiler's and Doberman's). In there he is chased by the dogs until Frank shows up and fights them off with unusual tactics, including biting one and punching another.\n\nThe next day, the pair are berated and fined $100 each by O'Connell for their screw up in not nabbing or identifying the thieves despite their contention that they had machine guns and were wearing ski masks. This leaves them suspicious of the company as they hadn't done anything to warrant the hefty fine (almost a week's pay). When Maggie asks about the meeting afterwards, both men vent their anger about O'Connell (Dooley calls him a jerk while Kane calls him a \"Sub-human, moronic, poop head\"), only to be informed by Maggie that O'Connell is actually her father.\n\nDooley and Kane then attend a meeting of the union, where after getting turned down in their plea to have the fine revoked and it being revealed that Klepper and Lazarus work for Carlino, Kane pointedly questions union president Michael Carlino (Robert Loggia) about how the union dues each member is required to pay are spent (roughly $4 million per year). After Kane rejects an evasive answer from Union treasurer Lou Brackman (James Tolkan), an enraged Carlino threatens to break Kane's legs should he ever attend another union meeting and then abruptly adjourns the meeting.\n\nOver the next few days, Dooley and Kane find themselves assigned to work at a landfill and a toxic waste dump, causing both to come to the conclusion that the assignments are the result of Kane speaking out at the union meeting. At the toxic waste dump, Dooley and Kane listen to a similar story by two burned-out guards about a robbery incident over three weeks ago when they were on warehouse duty and forced to take their lunch break by Bruno which resulted in the warehouse getting robbed while they were away.\n\nConvinced something illegal is afoot, the pair track down Bruno at his gym and interrogate him. With the threat of heavy weights crashing down on his head, Bruno confesses that it was O'Connell who had phoned him that night and instructed him to order Dooley and Kane to go to lunch and be away from the warehouse at exactly midnight, but maintains that he doesn't know anything about the robbery. After letting Bruno go, the bumbling duo make a quick escape from the gym while an angry Bruno chases after them on foot.\n\nThe pair then visit an old friend of Dooley's, a retired thief named Cappy (Tony Burton), who is fishing with other men at a small pier, to get information on Carlino. Upon learning of Carlino's corruption (which cost Kane a weeks pay in bribes for information as Cappy wouldn't take money from Dooley), they bring their suspicions to Maggie, but she rejects them as having no evidence to back them up.\n\nAn evening or two later, Dooley and Kane meet two loose women at a local bar where they dress up in blue tuxedos and use the women as their escorts to crash a formal dinner party thrown by Carlino in hopes of gathering some evidence. While hiding out in an overheated steam room and eavesdropping on a meeting between Carlino and Brackman in the backyard, they learn of Carlino's use of the union's pension fund to finance dealings with a Colombian drug cartel and his plans to have the money robbed from an armored car, with insurance covering the loss. Fearing an investigation by the insurance company in which he will be the fall guy for turning the funds into cash, Brackman urges Carlino not to go through with the robbery. In response, Carlino instructs Klepper and Lazarus to take Brackman away and dispose of him. Dooley and Kane attempt to save Brackman, but are too late to prevent his murder and instead find themselves framed for his death. At the party, Maggie asks O'Connell about what is happening, he refuses to give her any answer and tells her to stay out of his business.\n\nA long chase beings as Dooley and Kane are chased by Carlino's henchmen from the Hollywood Hills and through downtown L.A., and evade them, only to run into the police which their car goes off the road. After hiding out in a porno bookstore and peep show, Dooley and Kane evade the bad cops looking for them by somehow dressing up as outlandish gay couple (Dooley being a 'Divine' lookalike and Kane as a leather-man), the two spend the rest of the night evading the police.\n\nIn the morning, the cross-dressing duo meet at at a park with the receptive and amused Maggie where they reveal Carlino's intentions and make plans to prevent the armored car robbery. Kane and Maggie take over driving the truck, while Dooley plans to meet them ahead of the would-be robbers.\n\nOn the 6th Street Bridge, Dooley has problems with his motorcycle and is forced to hitch a ride with \"Cowboy\" (Steve Railsback), a wild trucker who eagerly disobeys traffic laws and uses his truck to ram his way through a traffic jam (while hauling VERY flammable rocket fuel).\n\nMeanwhile, Kane and Maggie avoid assaults from multiple cars attempting to hold them up. With the Cowboy's help, Dooley is able to arrive in time to save the armored car from a guided missile strike and foil a final attack from Klepper and Lazarus with his illegal .50 caliber handgun (Dooley tells The Cowboy that they only used the gun to hunt Buffalo \"up close\", and that its only legal in two states, but California wasn't one of them). O'Connell, a willing partner of Carlino's, no longer willing to abide the scheme after Carlino threatened to hurt Maggie if he didn't co-operate with the robbery, arrives having captured Carlino and his associates, the two detectives who originally framed Dooley and had him thrown off the police force.\n\nThe criminals are arrested and the Police Chief (Bruce Kirby) invites Dooley back to the police force as a plain clothed detective... along with a reluctant Kane who wants to go back to the relative safety of being a lawyer."

    "Army of Thieves": "Sebastian (Matthias Schweighofer) has a mundane life as a bank teller in Potsdam. A zombie outbreak in Nevada dominates international news, giving him nightmares about zombies. He also produces YouTube videos about safe-cracking that receive no attention until a mysterious figure comment on his most recent, inviting him to an underground safe-cracking competition. Sebastian goes, winning the contest. Gwendoline (Nathalie Emmanuel) then introduces herself, a skilled jewel thief who had commented upon his YouTube video.\n\nGwendoline recruits Sebastian into a heist crew consisting of herself, expert hacker Korina (Ruby O. Fee), getaway driver Rolph (Guz Khan) and gunman Brad Cage (Stuart Martin) with the intention of breaking into three banks that have the three safes created by legendary locksmith Hans Wagner (Christian Steyer) (Hans had created 4 safes, but one was lost to the vagaries of time. If you attempted to force the locks, the contents of the safe would be burnt. Hans finishes his work and locks himself in his final safe (the 5th), which was dropped in the ocean with his body still inside), which currently belong to billionaire Bly Tanaka. The safes are due to be decommissioned in less than a week (and the puzzle that Hans Wagner spent his life developing will be lost forever), so time is running out for someone to break into them.\n\nSebastian, a theoretical expert on Wagner's work and safe-cracking but with no practical experience, is convinced by Gwendoline to join them for the challenge of breaking into a Wagner safe. Together, the crew successfully undertakes their heist of the first safe in Paris (the least complex of the 3, and also the least guarded), escaping with only a fraction of the money that is actually in the safe. Gwendoline justifies this as the challenge and reputation is better than any major monetary gain.\n\nAs the crew celebrate after the Paris heist, Sebastian develops feelings for Gwendoline, drawing jealousy from Brad, her boyfriend since their teenage years when his real name was Alexis. The crew travel to Prague the location of the second safe (rumored to contain $40 MM), and are followed by Delacroix (Jonathan Cohen), an obsessive Interpol agent (who knows about the legend of Hans Wagner safes and knows where the team will strike next) leading a unit that has been trying to capture Gwendoline and the crew for years after Brad shot him during a theft.\n\nSebastian and Gwendoline enter the bank but are soon identified by security, forcing Brad to create a distraction with a pretend robbery. He cracks the second safe, leaving with Gwendoline and another haul of money as Delacroix and his team race to the bank to stop them (he went to the wrong bank at first, who had traded their Wagner safe to one of their more prestigious branches). Brad is shot in the shoulder by a security guard and narrowly escapes the bank, ahead of Sebastian and Gwendoline. As the team flee, Brad deliberately leaves Sebastian behind, forcing him to shake off the pursuing police alone.\n\nAngry at Brad's actions, Gwendoline and Korina leave the crew, although the original plan was to ditch Sebastian after the three heists were complete. The women head back to Potsdam and reunite with Sebastian, telling him that the pursuit of the Wagner challenge is more important to them than any monetary gain. The trio head to St. Moritz, location of the last safe in Europe, whilst Interpol also arrives. Delacroix's team believe they have a lead on the theft, only to be tricked again by them. They hijacked the safe during its transfer from the casino (Korina had called the casino as Interpol and told them about a possible security threat to the vault and advised them to move it). Their hijacking also usurps Brad and Rolph's idea to rob the safe themselves.\n\nGwendoline and Sebastian leave St. Moritz on a lorry, chased by Brad and Rolph. Korina, caught by Interpol, manages to warn them about the other two. Sebastian has to crack the safe in the lorry while they are pursued by Brad and Rolph, and Interpol. He succeeds, finding another large haul of cash. Before they can leave with it however, Rolph and increasingly unstable Brad arrive. She overpowers and handcuffs them to the truck for Interpol to find before leaving with Sebastian.\n\nBefore escaping on a boat from the town of Hallstatt, Austria, Sebastian, and Gwendoline confess their mutual feelings. However, Delacroix catches them, resulting in a standoff between him and Gwendoline. Out of love for Sebastian, she sacrifices herself to be arrested so that he can escape, promising to find him once she is free. Sebastian goes, vowing he will be reunited with Gwendoline one day.\n\nSometime later, Scott Ward and Maria Cruz find Sebastian's (now Ludwig's) locksmith shop in California. They offer him the chance to crack Wagner's legendary \"missing\" safe, which Gwendoline and Sebastian had resolved to crack together once she was free; Sebastian accepts the job."

    "Army of the Dead": "A United States military convoy traveling from Area 51 collides with a car on the highway outside Las Vegas. The convoy's cargo, a zombie, escapes, killing and infecting several soldiers before heading into the city. There, they infect most of the city's population. After a military intervention fails, the government quarantines the city.\n\nSix years later, casino owner Bly Tanaka (Hiroyuki Sanada) and his associate Martin (Garret Dillahunt) approach former Las Vegas resident and mercenary Scott Ward (Dave Bautista) about a job to recover $200 million from his casino vault in Las Vegas before the military deploys a tactical nuclear strike on the city. Tanaka offers Ward $50 million as payment for the job. Ward agrees (after his own daughter gets infected, and he had to kill her with his own hands, and he has nothing left to fight for) and recruits his former teammates Maria Cruz (Ana De La Reguera) and Vanderohe (Omari Hardwick), along with helicopter pilot Marianne Peters (Tig Notaro), German safe-cracker Ludwig Dieter (Matthias Schweighofer), and Chicano sharpshooter Mikey Guzman (Ra\u00fal Castillo), who brings along his associate Chambers (Samantha Win). Martin joins the team to give them access to the casino.\n\nWard secretly offers to keep $15 million each for himself, Maria and Vanderohe, as they all go way back to their time in the military. Peters is offered $ 2 million. Mikey signs up for $500,000. Ludwig is offered $250,000. Ward's estranged daughter Kate (Ella Purnell), who works at a quarantine camp, directs them to Lilly (Nora Arnezeder), a smuggler familiar with the city, who also recruits Burt Cummings (Theo Rossi), an abusive camp security guard (for $20,000). Ward offers Kate the entire portion of his $15 million cut in exchange for her help. When Kate learns Lilly escorted her friend Geeta (Huma Qureshi) into Las Vegas, Kate insists on joining the team over Ward's objections. Geeta was also looking for the casino money (though only 5000 $$) to buy her way out of the quarantine camp for herself and her kids.\n\nAfter an encounter with a tiger zombie upon entering Las Vegas, Lilly wounds Cummings and explains that a group of intelligent zombies known as \"Alphas\" will allow safe passage in exchange for a sacrifice. An Alpha female known as the Queen (Athena Perample) takes Cummings away to the Olympus casino, where the Alpha leader Zeus (Richard Cetrone) infects him. Lilly leads the team to a building full of hibernating, normal zombies. They wake up only when light is flashed into their eyes. Ward creates a path through the zombies with glow sticks. When Chambers accuses Martin of ulterior motives, he diverts her off the path, and she wakes the zombies. After she is surrounded and bitten, Guzman shoots the gasoline canister on her back, killing her and the surrounding zombie horde.\n\nArriving at Bly's casino (Dieter finds another set of blueprints for the vault, which indicates that Tanaka had sent other teams before them. Martin says he has no knowledge of this), Ward and Kate turn on the power, Peters prepares a helicopter on the roof, and Dieter works on the vault. Meanwhile Geeta is revealed to be alive and in custody of Zeus. Zeus keeps captured humans alive and takes them one by one for feasting.\n\nMartin and Lilly stay outside under the pretense of keeping watch but instead lure the Queen into the open. Martin beheads her and takes her head. Turns out Lilly was working for Martin and Tanaka the whole time, but she thought Martin only needed a vial of the queen's blood. Martin says his bosses want to use the queen's head to have the power to create their own zombie army. Zeus discovers her body and returns her to the Olympus casino, revealing that the Queen was pregnant with a zombie fetus. Enraged, Zeus directs the Alphas to the casino. A news report reveals the government has brought forward the nuclear strike, giving the team approximately 90 minutes. As Dieter opens the vault, Ward discovers Kate had left to look for Geeta. As Ward and Cruz are about to search for her, the Alphas appear and kill Cruz.\n\nMartin traps the team in the basement, explaining that Bly cares only about the zombie head, which can create a zombie army for the government and is worth more than the money in the vault. When he steps outside, he discovers Lilly stole the Queen's head, and the tiger mauls him to death. Vanderohe attempts to fight Zeus (who had broken into the vault basement) but is easily overpowered. Dieter sacrifices himself to get Vanderohe into the vault safely. Ward, Lilly, and Guzman make it to the lobby, where zombies attack them and swarm Guzman, who detonates his grenades, killing the zombies at the cost of his own life and destroying the money he carried. Lilly and Ward head to the roof for the copter.\n\nZeus come out of the basement and heads to the roof and confronts them on the roof. Lilly distracts him with the Queen's head as Ward and Peters escape. Zeus fatally impales Lilly, who destroys the Queen's head by dropping it off the roof.\n\nPeters takes Ward to the Olympus casino to retrieve Kate. Inside, Kate finds Geeta and kills the infected Cummings (who had turned into a zombie by now). Zeus chases them onto Peters' helicopter, and Ward accidentally shoots Peters, causing the helicopter to fly haphazardly. Zeus overpowers Ward and bites him. As the nuke destroys Las Vegas, Zeus is distracted by the bomb flash, and Ward kills him. The nuke's shock-wave causes the helicopter to crash, killing Peters and Geeta. Kate survives and finds Ward, who gives Kate money to start a new life before turning into a zombie. Kate kills him and breaks down in tears as a rescue helicopter arrives.\n\nHaving survived the blast, Vanderohe exits the vault with the remaining money and later rents a plane to take him to Mexico City. On the flight, he discovers that he has been bitten."

    "Around the World in 80 Days": "A Chinese man, Lau Xing (Jackie Chan), robbed and try to escape from the Bank of England. To escape from the police, he observes from a window, two police officers searching for him asking an Oriental man in the street for his identification, and says \"Passport...too\", he becomes, under the name \"Passepartout\" (pronounced Pass-par-too), a valet to Phileas Fogg (Steve Coogan), a scientist trying to break the 50-mph speed barrier. After succeeding to do so, and managing to avoid the police, they head to the Royal Academy of Science. Here, Fogg is insulted by other 'brilliant minds', in particular the bombastic Lord Kelvin (Jim Broadbent), who believes that everything worth discovering has already been discovered and there is no need for further progress.\n\nThe bank robbery is also discussed. In his blind rage, Fogg says that he's glad the bank was robbed because it is outdated and says that the thief could be in China in little over a month, which interests Lau Xing. Fogg places a bet to see if it would be possible (as his calculations said) to travel around the world in 80 days. If he won, he would become Minister of Science in Lord Kelvin's place; if not, he would tear down his lab and never invent anything again.\n\nPassepartout and Phileas retreat to Phileas's home, where he mourns on his rash decision; yet Passepartout said that to bet on something he believed in made the bet in no way foolish. Without losing a moment, they take a carriage and leave London, after crossing with Inspector Fix (Ewen Bremner), a corrupt officer who was hired to stop them from travelling around the world.\n\nThey then travel to Paris, where Passepartout must evade minions sent by the murderous female soldier General Fang, out after what he stole: the Jade Buddha, which is a sign of good fortune. She had given the Buddha to Lord Kelvin in exchange for military assistance in her enterprises to conquer Lau Xing's village. Pretending to take Phileas to a convention with Thomas Edison, Passepartout leads him instead to an Art School, where Phileas meets Monique (C\u00e9cile De France), a would-be impressionist. Realizing how busy his boss is, Passepartout fights the minions using every material available: canvas, brushes, buckets of paint, etc. Meanwhile, Phileas and Monique discuss Monique's paintings of 'impossible things', such as dogs playing poker. Moments later, Phileas sees a painting of a man with wings. To make a machine that could allow men to fly was always Phileas's dream; he therefore feels touched. All of a sudden, Passepartout returns and tells his boss that they are late. The two men, accompanied by Monique, depart in a hot-air balloon.\n\nThey then travel to Turkey, where they are greeted by Prince Hapi (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Here, they were entertained for some hours in a swimming pool. The prince, having become infatuated with Monique and ordered her to stay as his seventh wife (one for each day of the week) while the men were ordered to leave. The men leave, but blackmail Prince Hapi into releasing Monique, using a prized but apparently flimsy statue of the Prince as a bargaining counter. The statue is a parody of Rodin's The Thinker made to look like the Prince. The statue is ultimately destroyed, though the three travelers' escape.\n\nLord Kelvin, hearing of all this and of the theft of the Jade Buddha, becomes angry; he is later contemptuous when he learns that Fogg has been involuntarily abetting a thief's escape. Using this as an excuse to delay Phileas, he and his aides order the British colonial authorities in India to arrest both men. In India, Passepartout sees notice of the price on his head and warns his companions. Disguised as local women, they evade the police, but are attacked by General Fang's agents. Using Inspector Fix and a sextant as weapons, Phileas and Passepartout defeat their assailants and flee to China.\n\nGuided by knowledge of China, Passepartout leads his friends to a village, where they are happily greeted. They spend several days here, during which Phileas discovers that Passepartout is in fact Lau Xing, a local warrior, and that the repeated attacks by General Fang's militia, the Black Scorpions, are part of a power struggle centered around the Jade Buddha. Phileas is disappointed by this, and more so by the revelation that Monique has known the truth for many weeks.\n\nLater, the village is attacked by the Black Scorpions. Phileas, Monique and Lau Xing are held captive. In the next morning, Lau Xing challenges the arrogant young leader of the group that has seized him to a fight. Lau Xing at first fights alone, and is defeated; moments later, he is joined by the members of the \"Ten Tigers\" fraternity, of whom he is one. The Tigers, though outnumbered, drive the Black Scorpions from their village and free the Westerners. The Jade Buddha is reinstated in the village's temple.\n\nPhileas now desires to continue alone, having been disappointed by his companions. He travels to San Francisco, where he is tricked out of his money. He attempts to replenish his supply with the aid of a beggar (Rob Schneider) but fails. He is recognized by Lau Xing and Monique, who have come to find him. It was in the desert that they found the Wright brothers (brothers Owen and Luke Wilson), and the 3 inventors discussed the flying machine. Taking a look at the plans (which Wilbur Wright claimed to be his silly brother's doing), Phileas found them brilliant and suggested a few mere changes (Wilbur says he was proud of his brother and had always believed in him).\n\nLau Xing (still called Passepartout because of force of habit on the other people's part), Monique and Phileas' next stop was New York, where a massive crowd who had placed bets for or against Phileas winning, greeted them and made it impossible for them to pass and reach their ship. A policeman allowed this to be possible, by taking them through a building he called a shortcut. Here more minions awaited them, ready for one last face-off. They made arrangements with Lord Kelvin to take Lau Xing's village and tap the jade reserves underneath it, but if Phileas wins the bet, Lord Kelvin will not have the means to help them.\n\nA major battle between the three friends and General Fang and her minions started in the workshop where the statue of liberty was made, with Lau Xing using his skill to stop his enemies and the other two using luck. In the end the three friends were victorious, or so it seemed, as the minions had stalled them enough to make them lose their ship to England. Though Phileas could have gotten to the boat, he decides to miss it to help Lau Xing.\n\nPhileas felt like he had lost, but the other two said they might still make it if they caught the next ship. Phileas knew the unlikelihood of this yet chose to carry on. The old ship was owned by a sailor who had lost both his nipples in an attack by a shark. Phileas told the captain they weren't going fast enough, and after a lot of talking, he managed to convince the captain to let him build a plane out of the old wood from the ship, in exchange for a new ship and a surgery to give him new nipples.\n\nThe building started and soon was over. Using the changed Wright brother's plans, Phileas built a machine that seemed to work. On it was Lau Xing (pedaling), Phileas (driving), and Monique (commenting). The machine was working fine and soon they reached London. Then, the machine began to fall apart, and they had a crash-landing in front of the RAS. Lord Kelvin sends police to stop them from making it to their actual destination, the top step of the Royal Academy of Science, and the clock soon strikes noon, which is the time Phileas started.\n\nLord Kelvin proclaims himself the victor. Several people, such as Monique, Fix, and other ministers, begin attesting to Kelvin's unfair methods and his bullying nature, but Kelvin scoffs at them. However, in the process he insults the Queen Victoria (Kathy Bates), who is nearby listening. She had found out he had sold her arsenal to Fang thanks to one of his aides. Kelvin tries to run away but is apprehended.\n\nPhileas is also lucky enough not to have lost the bet; he is one day early thanks to crossing the international date line yet believed himself late because of an error on the part of Lau Xing. He ascends the stairs of the Academy and, there, embraces Monique, victorious in his bet."

    "Ars\u00e8ne Lupin": "As a boy in the 1880s, Ars\u00e8ne is being taught fencing by his father Th\u00e9ophraste Lupin. They live at the Ch\u00e2teau of his mother's family, the Dreux-Soubises. When the police tries to arrest Th\u00e9ophraste for thievery, he flees on horseback. Late at night, he returns to persuade Ars\u00e8ne to help him steal jewelry from his uncle--a collier that once belonged to Marie Antoinette. When the theft is discovered, the uncle makes Ars\u00e8ne and his mother leave the house. On the roadside, they are horrified see a murdered man who wears Th\u00e9ophraste's ring. Fifteen years later, young Ars\u00e8ne is on a cruise ship from Africa to Le Havre, gallantly stealing jewelry from the ladies. Back in France, he visits his dying mother in the hospital. She tells him that his father's murderer has visited her--then she dies. At her funeral, Ars\u00e8ne meets again his cousin Clarisse. She invites him home and spends the night with him. But Ars\u00e9ne doesn't want to stay--he wants to find his father's murderer. He feels that his uncle knows more than he admits, so he follows him to a secret meeting. A group of men around a descendant of the French royal family wants to end the Republic and reinstall monarchy in France. To complete this task, they are searching for a treasure that has been hidden by Marie Antoinette. They need several crosses from abbeys and cathedrals all over France to give them clues. Ars\u00e8ne witnesses Jos\u00e9phine, la comtesse de Cagliostro, being brought in and condemned to death for sabotaging the group and hiding Marie Antoinette's jewelry. Ars\u00e8ne understands that this is the jewelry that he himself had stolen for his father. He saves Jos\u00e9phine and becomes her lover. A member of the group, Beaumagnan, tries to warn Ars\u00e8ne against Jos\u00e9phine, but she in return warns Ars\u00e8ne against Beaumagnan. When Ars\u00e9ne breaks into the Louvre to discover another cross, he finds himself framed with the murder of the night guard. Still he has no idea who is framing him--Beaumagnan, Jos\u00e9phine or someone else? Things culminate at a ball, where Ars\u00e8ne, pretending to be a Russian Prince, dances with Clarisse. A hypnotized Beaumagnan steals another cross. Ars\u00e8ne confronts Jos\u00e9phine, then saves Clarisse from an over-eager suitor. Ars\u00e8ne learns that she is pregnant with his child. Beaumagnan tells him that he is Ars\u00e8ne's father with a remodeled face, and that he killed another to pretend his own death. Horrified by this news, Ars\u00e8ne manages to flee with the cross before the police arrives. When Clarisse visits him at his lab, she tells him that her father's group wants to trade--he can have her if he gives up the three crosses he has managed to collect so far. Jos\u00e9phine disrupts the meeting between Ars\u00e8ne and the group with a bomb. She saves Ars\u00e8ne and kidnaps Clarisse. They free themselves. Back in the lab, one of Ars\u00e8ne's accomplices shows them the body of Clarisse's father, who died in the explosion. They discover that he has a glass eye with the final clue to the treasure. Ars\u00e8ne and Clarisse get married and have their son, Jean. At night, Ars\u00e8ne leaves the house to break into rich people's homes. During one of those nights, Jos\u00e9phine enters his own home, shoots his wife and kidnaps his son. Ars\u00e8ne starts a hollow life of clever thefts, using various disguises and wrong names. In 1913, he has a new woman friend, and they attend a parade honoring Franz Ferdinand, the Austrian crown prince. Suddenly, Ars\u00e8ne sees Jos\u00e9phine with a young man--his son, Jean, grown-up! When he realizes that she has hypnotized Jean to place a bomb in a suitcase, he confronts Jean and makes him give up the suitcase, throwing it into the air. Jos\u00e9phine searches the hysteric crowd, but he has disappeared - all that's left on the sidewalk is a flower--a lupin."

    "Art of Love": "Alin (Esra Bilgic) and Ozan (Ushan Cakir) are Interpol officers who have been assigned to investigate a series of art thefts around the world. The thief seems to be breaking into museums and stealing the least valuable works of art, ignoring the other priceless artifacts in the same location. They quickly realize that the art thief is not grabbing the least valued paintings at the museums but specifically all paintings related to love. Putting this together helps them figure out the next target for the thief. Alin is right, but the thief is able to grab the painting in broad daylight with no one knowing and leave Alin just enough of a trace, see his face, but not be able to catch him.\n\nAlin immediately knows who the thief is now. Her ex-lover, Guney (Birkan Sokullu). Guney and Alin were going steady when he suddenly disappeared, without explanation, and left her heart broken. Interpol chief refuses to arrest Guney, as he is a billionaire and can easily buy the paintings he wants. He also says that Alin has a history with Guney, and hence they need solid evidence against him. Alin decides she's going to use her charm to catch Guney red-handed.\n\nWhen Alin approaches Guney, he asks her for a second chance, and she pretends to reluctantly give in. Guney explains that he ran away the first time as he was scared of commitment. In the meantime, Ozan has the information to figure out who is working with Guney now, and they also find a warehouse where they work. Alin tries to go there and get some evidence, but she's caught by Vera, Guney's hacker.\n\nVera and Alin get into a physical fight, leading Vera to believe Alin is a cop. But she only manages to see her eyes as Alin was wise enough to cover her face. From the recovered material, Alin figures out that the next theft will be in Prague. Alin and Guney spend more time together, and he tells her that he doesn't want to spend time apart, but he has a business trip to Prague for two days. Alin convinces him to take her along.\n\nThis is when she gets the billionaire treatment, and he takes her on a private jet and gifts her fancy new clothes. On the flight, Vera finds something strange about Alin and tells the other guy on their team, Omer (Hakan Ummak), that she might have been the cop who tried to break into the warehouse. At the time, Guney had dismissed the idea and said it must have been a random break-in. Alin's partner shows up at the hotel, saying she can't be doing a mission that her chief denied, but she's determined to catch Guney. However, Ozan thinks it's just her attraction to him that's keeping her there.\n\nGuney takes Alin to a private dress rehearsal for a romantic musical she's been wanting to watch, and it is enough for her to fall for Guney again. Alin and Guney almost go all the way in his hotel room, but Alin claims they're going too fast and leaves. The next day is the day of the robbery, and Guney leaves Alin with a car to use all day while he has some work. The second he's gone, Ozan and she follow him. Yet again, they're unable to catch him, and they're back to Istanbul and square one.\n\nFaysal Varli is an old man and a sleaze who is a businessman, and Guney plans on buying his company. Faysal has a private painting collection. He gives Alin and Guney a private viewing of this collection, and immediately, Alin realizes they're all stolen. This gives Guney the idea to break into the highly protected collection. This is a foolproof security system with too many layers, yet Guney has the confidence to break into it. There's a voice and face recognition step, and there are about 75 cameras leading up to the collection, so it's almost an impossible task. Additionally, there's a set of words, like a pass key, that keeps changing, that Faysal himself has to repeat for the vault to open. It's his voice that's recognized, but Guney has a solution for it all.\n\nJust as Guney is trying to break in and everything is going to plan, Faysal decides to bring a woman down to the vault. Vera freaks out, but just when they're about to enter the room, Faysal is asked to go back to the house. Alin is there to tell Faysal that his collection is going to be stolen from him, but he doesn't believe her. She tells him that she doesn't know who it will be, but she knows there's a plan. This is obviously not the answer he wants, so he chokes her to try and get her to spill, but Ozan shows up at that moment. He asks for the crime scene, but Faysal tells him to leave if he doesn't have a warrant. Alin decides the best thing to do is leave and take Ozan and the team with her.\n\nThe next day, Faysal shows up in her bedroom, and finds out it was Guney who stole the painting thanks to her notes in her apartment with all the investigation on Guney. Alin tries to find Guney to warn him and tell him the truth. Guney already knew that Alin worked for Interpol, and he left a trail for her to find him on purpose.\n\nGuney had disappeared for some time without a trace because he was caught in Mexico. This left Alin heartbroken because he never reached out to her or told her anything about what he used to do. After 3 years, he did a press conference to show up on the grid again, but by this time, Alin had already started to work for Interpol in Paris. Apparently, he found it really hard to find her, and when he did, he couldn't just tell her he was a thief. So now, he basically made her go in circles to fall in love with him again. Guney takes Alin to his grandfather's house. It seems he got interested in art thanks to his grandfather, who was a wonderful painter but was never recognized for his work. However, the reason Guney decided to start stealing is because when they were first together, Alin told him that the Mona Lisa went up in value only after it got stolen.\n\nFaysal stands across from Guney and Alin in front of a lake, a dead end. Faysal shoots past Guney's ear, just missing him to threaten him. This is after Guney has been tormenting Alin to tell him she still loves him all the way while running away from Faysal. Just as Faysal is about to shoot again, Ozan shows up. Guney did Ozan a favor by giving him information about Faysal (when Guney broke into Faysal's vault, he found information and documents that linked Faysal to the drugs trade); in return, Ozan will leave Guney alone because he's only a harmless art and heart stealing person. Since Ozan is an ex-narcotics officer, he is, of course, thrilled to lock up Faysal. Alin promises not to turn Guney in and tells him she loves him. There are two options, one is that Alin stops working for Interpol so that she and Guney can go on a robbing spree since they won't really have anything else to do and they're both clearly so interested in art. On the other hand, Guney will stop stealing for the thrill of it and go back to being just a boring old billionaire. Or maybe they start an underground art gallery together with all the stolen pieces and never get found out."

    "Artemis Fowl": "On the coast of Ireland, a media frenzy descends on Fowl Manor, where a stolen collection of world-famous relics are linked to wealthy businessman, Artemis Fowl. Arrested at the manor, Mulch Diggums is interrogated by British intelligence and claims that his employer has stolen the powerful \"Aculos\". Offering to prove the existence of magic, Diggums tells the story of Artemis Fowl, Jr.\n\nThree days earlier, Artemis, a 12-year-old genius, lives at Fowl Manor with his widowed father Artemis Sr, who goes missing from his boat, accused of the theft of several priceless artifacts found aboard. Artemis Jr receives a call from a hooded figure. Holding his father captive, the hooded figure gives Artemis three days to recover the Aculos, which Artemis Sr. has stolen and hidden. Domovoi \"Dom\" Butler, Artemis' bodyguard, shows him a hidden library where generations of Fowls have catalogued proof of the existence of magical creatures.\n\nDeep underground in Haven City - home to a civilization of fairies - Mulch, an oversized dwarf thief, encounters Lower Elements Police reconnaissance (LEPrecon) officer Holly Short as he is taken to prison. Commander Julius Root dispatches the LEPrecon force to search for the Aculos, the fairies' greatest resource. Foaly, LEPrecon's centaur technical advisor, discovers an unauthorized creature has reached the surface. Holly is sent to investigate, despite the fact that her father, Beechwood Short, stole the Aculos and was killed. In Martina Franca, Italy, Holly intervenes as a rogue troll and attacks a human wedding party. Using a \"time freeze\", LEPrecon subdues the troll and wipes the humans' memories.\n\nDom's 12-year-old niece Juliet arrives at the manor. From his father's journal, Artemis learns that Beechwood brought the Aculos to Artemis Sr. to keep it from the hooded figure, revealed to be Opal Koboi, a fairy planning to wipe out humankind. Artemis sends Dom to stakeout the Hill of Tara. Holly, determined to clear her father's name, disobeys orders and flies to the Hill of Tara, where she finds Beechwood's ID tag, but is captured by Dom and imprisoned inside the manor.\n\nRoot and an army of LEPrecon officers seal Fowl Manor in a time freeze, but Artemis and Dom fight them off using Holly's equipment. Artemis demands the Aculos in exchange for Holly's release, forbidding fairies to enter his home while he is alive. Bound by fairy rules, Root retrieves Mulch from prison, offering him a reduced sentence to infiltrate Fowl Manor. Mulch tunnels inside and breaks into Artemis Sr.'s safe, finding the Aculos, while Artemis frees Holly and asks for her help. Lieutenant Briar Cudgeon, a spy for Koboi, seizes command of LEPrecon and releases the captured troll into the house, jamming all magic inside.\n\nMulch swallows the Aculos as Artemis, Holly, Juliet, and Dom evade the troll, which is subdued. Pushing Artemis out of the troll's way, Dom is mortally wounded. Against orders, Holly's fellow officers unblock her magic, and she revives Dom. Mulch and the LEPrecon army escape as the time freeze collapses. Left with the Aculos, Artemis refuses to give it to Koboi, and Holly agrees to use it to rescue Artemis' father. As Koboi attempts to kill Artemis Sr., Holly summons him to Fowl Manor.\n\nArtemis Sr. tells Holly that her father gave his life to protect the Aculos, giving her a list of Koboi's accomplices. Holly returns the Aculos to Haven City, where Root, back in command, directs her to investigate every name on the list. Artemis calls Koboi, promising to come after her. Mulch's interrogator offers him freedom in exchange for help capturing Artemis Sr., but Mulch reveals that Artemis arranged his arrest to prove the incident to the authorities, and confirms the existence of magic on camera. As the interrogator calls for backup, the Fowls' helicopter rescues Mulch and, joined by Holly, they fly off."

    "Assassin's Creed": "Spain, 1492\n\nThe Knights of the Templar Order are seeking out the Apple of Eden, which legend tells contains the seeds that led to the first sin. The Templars wants to seize the Apple for control over free will in a violent world. The Brotherhood of Assassins were the ones set out to destroy the Templars. Aguilar de Nerha (Michael Fassbender) is tasked with stopping the Templars from taking the Apple. He recites the Assassin's Creed: \"We work in the dark to serve the light. We are Assassins.\"\n\nWe jump to the 20th century where a young Callum Lynch (Angus Brown) trying to ride his bike across rooftops. After he fails, he goes home and finds his mother Mary (Essie Davis) has been murdered by Cal's father Joseph (Brian Gleeson), who is dressed as an Assassin. Cal runs away from home as his father is pursued by modern day Templars.\n\nIt is now the present day. An adult Callum (now played by Michael Fassbender) is headed to his execution after being convicted of murder. He is hooked up to a chair for a lethal injection. Cal experiences trippy imagery before passing out.\n\nCal wakes up to find Dr. Sophia Rikkin (Marion Cotillard), who tells him that he is legally dead, but has been brought to a facility. Cal runs out of his room and comes across a window overlooking the city in a massive building. Sophia tells Cal that the building belongs to Abstergo Industries. They need Cal for an important experiment.\n\nCallum is taken to a room with a large claw-like mechanism called the Animus. Sophia explains that the Animus will allow Cal to see the memories of his ancestor, Aguilar. After getting hooked into the Animus, Cal finds himself in the Spanish Inquisition as Aguilar. He and his partner Maria (Ariane Labed) are tasked with rescuing the son of Sultan Muhammad XII (Khalid Abdalla), Prince Ahmed of Granada (Kemaal Deen-Ellis), who has been kidnapped by Templars under the order of Tomas de Torquemada (Javier Gutierrez) in order to obtain the Apple from the Sultan. Aguilar strikes when he kills the Templar group's leader with a Hidden Blade concealed in his sleeve. Aguilar and Maria chase after a chariot where Ahmed is being taken. They run the chariot off the street, causing it to slide over a cliff. Aguilar grabs Ahmed and is left dangling before a Templar leader named Ojeda (Hovik Keuchkerian) approaches him. Sophia then takes Callum out of the Animus, leaving him on a literal cliffhanger.\n\nCal meets other people in the facility who are descendants of Assassins, including Moussa (Michael K. Williams), whose ancestor Baptiste used voodoo against his enemies.\n\nCal begins to experience hallucinations of Aguilar fighting, at times appearing as though he is attacking Cal. Sophia explains that these reflections are normal as part of being put in the Animus. She states that the Animus is meant to show people who made them what they are.\n\nSophia and her father Alan Rikkin (Jeremy Irons) are followers of the Templars. They both claim to be seeking the Apple of Eden in order to rid the world of violence. Rikkin meets with a higher-up, Ellen Kaye (Charlotte Rampling), who wants to shut down Rikkin's project due to the lack of success in locating the Apple.\n\nCal experiences more hallucinations, seeing Aguilar attacking him. Cal dodges Aguilar's attacks, but he ends up striking several Abstergo officials. He is subdued and taken back to the Animus. Now, Aguilar and Maria are captured and detained in a cell with their mentor Benedicto (Carlos Bardem). The Assassins are set to be publicly executed. Benedicto is burned alive, but Aguilar manages to free himself and Maria. They cause explosions by setting off oil barrels and then run over rooftops as the Templars chase after them. Aguilar performs a Leap of Faith, but it causes Callum in the present to be caught in a malfunction with the Animus.\n\nCal and Sophia discuss the project as they both hate the Assassins as it was they that killed both their mothers.\n\nCal reunites with Joseph (now played by Brendan Gleeson). Cal still hates Joseph for killing Mary, but Joseph explains that Mary had willingly allowed herself to be killed so that Abstergo would not experiment on them.\n\nWhen Callum returns to the Animus, we see that Aguilar and Maria found the Apple about to be exchanged between Torquemada and the Sultan in order for Torquemada to return Ahmed to his father. The Assassins fight the Templars and kill them all except for Torquemada and Ojeda. Aguilar gets the Apple, but Ojeda holds Maria with a knife to her neck. Ojeda demands the Apple, but Maria would rather sacrifice herself than to let Aguilar give up the Apple. Aguilar holds onto the Apple, and Ojeda drives the knife into Maria's neck, killing her. Aguilar fights Ojeda and stabs him to death with his Hidden Blade before making off the with Apple.\n\nThe Rikkins learn that the Apple is currently in the tomb of Christopher Columbus. After retrieving it, they head to a temple in London for a grand ceremony. Sophia learns that her father cares more about completely eradicating the Assassins instead of their strive for peace.\n\nCallum has fully synchronized with Aguilar and has accepted his role as an Assassin, especially after seeing Mary dressed as an Assassin as she speaks to him. He leads Moussa and several other modern day Assassins against the Templars, slaughtering nearly all of them. Cal and Sophia come across each other. She threatens to expose him, but he knows she won't do it. They make it to Rikkin and kill him before taking back the Apple.\n\nThe Assassins are now free from Abstergo, but Sophia appears to conspire against Callum in retaliation for her father's death."

    "Assassination": "In Washington, D.C., after a six-week leave of absence, Secret Service agent Jay Killian (Charles Bronson) returns to work on the day of President Calvin Craig's (Charles Howerton) inauguration. Killian is assigned to protect First Lady Laramie \"Lara\" Royce Craig (Jill Ireland), whom the Secret Service has given the code name \"One Momma.\" A brash and smart-mouthed feminist who intends to push her husband to support the Equal Rights Amendment, Lara is dismissive of Secret Service rules, saying that no one has ever tried to kill a president's wife. She takes an immediate dislike to Killian, who is offended that he was not assigned to protect the president.\n\nWhile Lara rides in the inaugural motorcade in a convertible, a police motorcycle riding alongside her explodes. Killian pulls Lara down to protect her, but she insists she is all right. Killian does not think the explosion was an accident and he reports that the cop on the motorcycle looked like terrorist Eddie \"Reno\" Bracken (Erik Stern). Secret Service agent Charlotte \"Charlie\" Chang (Jan Gan Boyd) comes to the rundown Hotel Farragut where Killian has been living since his divorce was finalized ten days ago. He tells Charlie that his ex-wife, Imogene, was sleeping with many senators and looted their joint bank account. Although Killian and Charlie have been having an affair, he initially resists her attempts at seduction. However, later, they make love at Charlie's apartment in the Watergate complex.\n\nThe first lady requests Killian be replaced, but when she leaves the White House without prior clearance, Killian is the only one available to go after her. She boards a private plane at Andrews Air Force Base, heading to her father's estate in Newport Beach, California, where she intends to take his yacht to Catalina Island. The yacht is being scrubbed for barnacles and repainted, but one of the workers plants a plastic explosive on the bottom of the boat. The yacht explodes in Newport Beach Harbor, but Lara insists it was not an assassination attempt.\n\nKillian gets Lara back to Washington, D. C., where an investigation shows that one of the men who painted the yacht was Pritchard Young, a terrorist connected to Reno Bracken. The White House Chief of Staff, Senator Hector Bunsen (Michael Ansara), orders Killian to take a week off at the first lady's request, but Killian's boss, Fitzroy (Stephen Elliott), orders him back to work.\n\nLara takes a helicopter to give a speech at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, but Killian forces the aircraft to land in a field. He transfers the first lady to a motorcade, where he believes she will be safer. As the helicopter takes off from the field, someone launches a bazooka at it and shoots it down, killing the pilot. Killian chases after the shooter, who runs into a barn. Killian fires a bazooka at the barn, causing it to erupt into flames, but the shooter escapes on a motorcycle. Killian believes the shooter was Reno Bracken. Lara concedes that someone is attempting to assassinate her and thanks Killian.\n\nLater, Killian follows her to a museum to which she is donating her inaugural gown, but she changes clothes, puts on a wig, and leaves the museum unrecognized. Killian chases after her and catches up to her at a gas station. Lara asks him to help her find out who is behind the assassination attempts on her life and takes him to hide out at a local motel, explaining that she is trying to disappear until they can find whoever is trying to kill her. However, Pritchard Young (William Hayes) has been following them and fires a machine gun at her motel room. Killian gets Lara to safety, then they take a bus to Kokomo, Indiana, where they buy two used motorcycles.\n\nWhile riding across the country, Lara confesses to Killian that she and the president, Calvin Craig, have an \"arrangement.\" They met in college in Berkeley, California, but he was injured while serving in the Air Force and is impotent. Lara believed in him, but knew a bachelor would not get far in politics. Thus, they put on a show of a great romance and eventually married. They agreed that once Craig was elected president, Lara could do as she pleased and discreetly divorce him. Killian points out that a divorcee would never stand a chance of being re-elected, but a widower would. He wonders if the president is behind the assassination attempts.\n\nOn back roads, a pick-up truck follows them and opens fire. Killian and Lara escape from the truck and board a train. However, as the train lunges forward, Lara falls into Killian's lap. Although both are aroused, they argue. When they notice a helicopter following the train, they get off and hitchhike into a small town where they buy a used dune buggy. Lara confesses that she told her husband where they are, which convinces Killian that he is behind the assassination attempts.\n\nMeanwhile, in Washington D.C., Chief of Staff Hector Bunsen secretly meets with Reno Bracken, whom he paid $1 million to kill the first lady. Bunsen reprimands Bracken for not finishing the job.\n\nKillian and Lara arrive in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, at the lakefront estate of her father, movie director H. H. \"Harry\" Royce. A man riding a jet ski pulls a boat loaded with explosives toward the lake house, but Killian spots him, and gives chase on a speedboat. The man ditches the jet ski and runs through the woods. When Killian fires at him, the would-be assassin fires back and Killian pretends he is shot. As the man approaches, Killian shoots him in the face, and recognizes him as Bracken.\n\nKillian and the first lady return to Washington, where they have Hector Bunsen arrested. It is revealed that Bunsen acted to preserve his job security, knowing a widowed president stood a better chance of being reelected. Lara is upset when Killian announces he is retiring from the Secret Service and going to work for her father, Harry Royce, as a personal bodyguard. After he says goodbye to Lara, Killian leaves the White House where he runs into Charlie Chang outside. Charlie tells Killian that she is also retiring and plans to join Killian. Charlie suggests they get married, but Killian wants to take their relationship slowly."

    "Assassins": "Robert Rath (Sylvester Stallone) is known as the number one paid assassin in the world. However, after retiring (killing) a \"mark\" (target) who used to be an assassin himself, he's more and more heavily considering retirement for himself as he is tired of his job and its lifestyle. He also feels quite lonely since he lost his best friend and mentor Nicolai Tashlinkov, who was murdered 15 years ago.\n\nAs soon as he confirms to his contractor that the mark has been terminated, Rath is offered another contract: A mobster attending his brother's funerals.\n\nRath disguises himself as a man with a broken arm, using the arm cast to hide his pistol and positions himself in front of the mobster. As he's about to make his move and retire his mark, he notices that someone else has already taken the shot and killed the target. Rath then exchanges fire with the unknown killer who allows himself to get arrested by the police when he realizes he is stuck between Rath and the cops, which he considers the safer option. Rath tries to follow the car but is blocked by traffic and loses the cop car.\n\nMeanwhile, the killer dislocates his thumb and slips out of his handcuffs before killing the cop driver causing a car crash. He then retrieves his riffle and kills the other cops that were following before fleeing the scene. Rath finds the crashed car and the dead cops. He then gets the idea to steal a taxi and wait for the right call. A single man within the same area going to the airport.\n\nRath gets the right call and immediately recognizes the killer from the cemetery. Because of the bulletproof glass, Rath cannot take him out yet. So Rath provokes an argument with his \"client\" hoping he will leave the car and Rath can take him out then, but his plan backfires when the man sees his cab driver is not displaying any I.D and realizes the driver is Rath.\n\nThe man introduces himself to be Miguel Bain (Antonio Banderas), a fellow assassin and a competitive sociopath. Bain is a super fan of Rath but still wants to kill him to officially become the number one assassin. Rath decides to sit out and wait for the younger Bain to lose patience and make the first move but Bain outsmarts him by aiming his riffle at an innocent child playing nearby, causing Rath to start driving. Bain tries to shoot Rath through the side window but Rath drives him into a bus causing Bain to lose his gun. As Rath stops the car to get out and shoot Bain, their shenanigans have attracted the cops' attention and they are now being chased. Bain jumps out of the car unnoticed by the cops and escapes. Rath is able to escape when he joins the cab company's home base where a hundred similar taxi cars are parked.\n\nAs Rath inquires about Bain to his contractor, he gets the feeling he is being set up as a mark and should retire now. Just then, his contractor offers him a new job: One that pays 2 million dollars. Rath accepts the contract thinking it will be his last job and the money is good to retire. The job is to kill an unknown computer hacker who has no known identity but the logo of a cat's eyes, and the four Dutch buyers to whom he/she intends to sell an encrypted computer disk and retrieve the disk.\n\nThe hacker, who later calls herself Electra (Julianne Moore), is a woman who has been living in complete anonymity for years now and with no personal attachment other than her cat Pearl. She has also set up hidden cameras in all the other apartments of her building to keep an eye on everyone around her.\n\nRath tracks the buyers from the airport to a Marriott's hotel where Electra has set up the meeting. Rath then uses the hotel's computer system to try and locate the hacker. When he stumbles upon a room that has been ordering coffee all morning and then a can of tuna fish, Rath deduces he has found who he is looking for based on Electra's known logo.\n\nElectra has set up cameras and an elaborate mechanism for remotely moving items between rooms of the hotel and uses it to make the exchange with the buyers. They pay her through her ventilation shaft system and she connects remotely to their computer to transfer the disk content and decrypt it.\n\nIn the meantime, Bain makes his way to the buyers' room and kills all of them, including people outside of their room who all turn out to be Interpol agents. He tries to lure Electra into completing the transmission but she picks up on his accent right away and deletes everything she had transferred so far. She tries to escape her room but Rath intercepts her. He then finds himself unable to kill her so he spares her life and escapes with her.\n\nElectra, not sure she can trust Robert, tries to escape him by running to a bus but has to leave Pearl behind which Robert retrieves and uses to track down Electra's home by visiting her favorite pet store. Meanwhile, Bain finds pictures in Electra's hotel room which he uses to pin down her apartment building. Finding a car with the engine still hot, he heads for the wrong apartment and kills her neighbors while Electra sees everything from her apartment. Rath arrives with Pearl and makes a deal with Electra to let her leave but meet up later. He then gets in a shoot out with Bain which ends when Bain is blasted out of the apartment after Rath lit up the gas line.\n\nRath takes Electra to a motel to rest and think about their next move. Electra grabs Robert's gun and threatens to kill him and disappear but Robert shows no fear, confident she doesn't have what it takes to kill, which he is proven right. The two spend an awkward night, both not having been in close quarters with another human being for years. She sleeps on the bed while he sleeps on the floor with his gun at the ready.\n\nRobert offers Electra half of his fee for the job if she will assist him in collecting his fee in exchange for the disk. Everything proceeds smoothly but Rath quickly realizes the suitcase carrying his money also carries a bomb. He dumps the suitcase just in time to watch it explode from the rear view mirror. Lucky for them, Electra didn't trust Robert entirely and had given him a fake disk.\n\nNow convinced his contractor is actively trying to kill him, Rath offers to surrender the disk in exchange for 20 million dollars instead of the original two, and requests it to be wired to a specific bank in the Caribbeans before he delivers the disk.\n\nThe contractor agrees to Rath's conditions and then hires Bain to take a contract on him. Rath and Electra travel to the bank the day before the transfer, where Rath identifies the decrepit, abandoned hotel that he knows Bain will use as a snipping post and plans a trap. He also reveals that the bank, the hotel and the plan were all chosen specifically because of what both Rath and Bain know. 15 years ago, it was Rath who stood in this hotel room all day to kill his best friend and mentor Nicolai after accepting to take a contract he has been regretting ever since.\n\nThat night, still shocked by Robert's revelation that he killed his own best friend and being fascinated by the Day of the dead parade taking place, Electra escapes their hotel room. However, she soon wishes she hadn't when she spots Miguel Bain at a beer stand. Lucky for her, he doesn't see her and soon assumes the perfume he is smelling comes from actual Jasmine flowers laid close by. She is also found by Rath who takes her safely back to their room.\n\nThe next day, Robert goes inside the bank to confirm the transfer and then closes out the account and collects the money in cash. An operation that takes several hours to perform. Robert patiently waits inside, knowing Bain is in position outside going crazier and crazier from the wait. Meanwhile, Electra is sitting at a public cafe, keeping an eye on Bain and waiting for him to leave his position and go check on Robert to make sure he is still in the bank. When it finally happens, she runs into the abandoned hotel to retrieve Bain's riffle so he can't shoot Robert. However, Bain was smart and hid the riffle. She finally finds it but it's out of reach and she falls through the floor. She is able to get back on her feet but it's too late. Bain is already running back to his position after confirming Rath is still in the bank. As Rath exits the bank, Bain notices Rath taking out his earpiece which tells him Rath is not alone. Just then he recognizes Electra's Jasmine perfume in the air. Electra uses Robert's pistol and shoots Bain in the back which causes him to misfire. Robert runs to the hotel.\n\nRobert then faces Bain in a lethal game of hide and seek which Bain loses when he is shot and falls through multiple floors.\n\nAfter Bain's apparent death, Nicolai appears, revealing that he was Robert's contractor all along and that he himself had set up his own assassination 15 years ago so he could disappear. On that day, he wore a protective device knowing exactly where Rath would shoot him. He also reveals that the disk contains information that would bring him out of the shadow should it ever be decrypted, which is why he wanted to kill Elektra and retrieve the disk before Interpol did.\n\nUnderstanding that Nicolai will most likely kill him too, Bain revives and joins Rath in shooting him dead. Bain pretends to make peace with Rath and allow him to retire but then reveals he still wants to kill Rath and become number one. He tries to shoot him in the back but Electra puts on her sunglasses, allowing Rath to see Bain; Rath shoots Bain through his own jacket and kills him. Electra then retrieves the money and the disk and both leave the hotel, ready to enjoy their respective retirement and revealing to each other their real names."

    "Assault on Precinct 13": "With only a few hours until the new year, Detroit's oldest police station, Precinct 13, is about to close forever. Only a skeleton crew of officers are on duty for New Year's Eve, including Sergeant Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), veteran officer Jasper (Brian Dennehy), Secretary Iris (Drea De Matteo), and psychiatrist Alex (Maria Bello). Roenick is haunted by a botched undercover operation from eight months before that resulted in the death of the other two members of his team.\n\nMeanwhile, crime lord Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne) is arrested after a confrontation which results in the death of an undercover officer. Bishop is put on a prison bus with three other criminals: addict Beck (John Leguizamo), petty crook Anna (Aisha Hinds), and counterfeiter Smiley (Ja Rule). A raging snowstorm and treacherous road conditions force the bus driver to make a detour to Precinct 13, where the prisoners are to be held until the storm is over.\n\nNew Year's celebrations at the precinct are soon cut short, however, as an intrusion by masked gunmen results in the death of one of the prison guards, and fatally injures the other. The officers soon find they are surrounded by unknown assailants, preparing to lay siege to the precinct. Cellular phone reception has been jammed, as well as any radio communication. After one of the attackers throws a brick into the precinct with \"Bishop\" written on it, Jasper claims they are Bishop's men, here to extract him.\n\nThis is proven to be false, however, after Roenick kills one of the attackers in another assault and reclaims the man's wallet, which contained his police badge. Bishop then reveals the attackers are actually policemen, led by corrupt Captain Marcus Duvall (Gabriel Byrne). Previously, Bishop and Duvall were partners in crime, but Duvall got greedy. Now he and his men, including Mike Kahane (Currie Graham), are to kill Bishop before he can testify at trial, saving all officers involved a hefty prison sentence. However, now that everyone inside precinct 13 knows of the true plot instead of just Bishop, they are all a liability and must be eliminated.\n\nHeavily outnumbered by a growing police force made up of street cops, snipers, and elite SWAT troopers, Roenick makes the decision to free and arm the prisoners to help them hold out until dawn. Although the officers do not trust the criminals, and the same the other way around, Roenick and Bishop reach an agreement to cooperate in order to stand a chance to survive the night. With their combined efforts, they manage to repel further attacks by the police forces and reclaim their weapons.\n\nSoon Precinct 13 is joined by another officer, off-duty cop Capra. After driving erratically enough to evade the snipers, he scurries into the building completely confused and panicked. The attending officers welcome him with open arms, but Beck accuses him of being a plant. Fearing he may start at shootout; Bishop subdues Beck to calm him down and settles the conflict. Smiley also thinks that Capra is a plant, so he and Beck decide to risk the police force outside for a shot at freedom and plan an escape over a nearby fence.\n\nAs the prison bus explodes and they notice Smiley and Beck escaping, they decide to use this as a distraction and also plan an escape, making use of Capra's car in order for a couple people to flee the precinct and call for help while the police are busy with Beck and Smiley. Anna, who can hot-wire a car, volunteers to go. Alex also goes along. Beck and Smiley make it to the perimeter fence before they are killed by snipers. Anna and Alex appear to have made it, before a cop hidden in the backseat shoots and kills Anna, causing the car to crash and Alex to be captured.\n\nAlex is brought before Duvall, who asks her how many are in the precinct. Defiant, she replies \"a hundred\", and she is executed by Duvall after complimenting her on her bravery. With only Roenick, Bishop, Jasper, Capra, and Iris left, the precinct stands little chance of withstanding further assaults. Bishop discovers the handcuffs that were holding the back door locked are removed. He concludes that someone inside is helping the police and accuses Capra, but before anything can be done, the police begin to lay siege to the precinct with SWAT reinforcements from the rooftop.\n\nJasper miraculously remembers an old sewage entrance beneath the precinct, and Roenick and Bishop set the precinct on fire to slow their pursuers. The survivors escape along an abandoned sewer passageway, but even as they find themselves on a deserted street they are suddenly surrounded by the corrupt policemen. Jasper reveals himself to have been the traitor all along, and the officers led by Duvall prepare to execute the remaining survivors.\n\nBishop sneaks a flash grenade into Jasper's jacket, and in the ensuing distraction the survivors disarm the officers and escape. Iris and Capra attempt to escape in the officers' car, while Roenick and Bishop flee into the forest. Duvall and another officer pursue Roenick, while Kahane goes after the car. The car flips and Capra is heavily injured, but Iris manages to stab Kahane with his own knife.\n\nIn the forest, Roenick is suddenly confronted by Bishop, who offers to cooperate in order to kill Duvall. As the corrupt officers have night vision and Roenick and Bishop do not, Roenick volunteers to draw their fire so Bishop can see the muzzle flashes from their weapons and dispose of them while they are distracted. The plan works, and Bishop kills the accompanying officer, but he is then shot in the stomach by Duvall who orders Bishop to lure Roenick into a trap. Roenick arrives and guns down Duvall but is shot in the side and injured also.\n\nAfter considering their cooperation throughout the night, Bishop decides to spare Roenick, who vows that he will find and arrest him someday. After Bishop limps away, officers led by Iris arrive. An officer asks Roenick if anyone else is in the forest, and after looking around for a moment he replies \"no\". The last shot is of an injured Roenick and Iris making their way to the ambulance, where Iris states she did not even recognize the battle-hardened Roenick of the night, and he replies, \"get used to it.\""

    "Assault on Precinct 13": "The story takes place on a Saturday day and night in Anderson, a crime-infested ghetto in South Central Los Angeles. Members of a local gang, called 'Street Thunder', have recently stolen a large number of automatic rifles and pistols. At 3:10 am, a team of heavily armed LAPD officers ambush and kill six members of the gang. In the morning, the gang's four warlords swear a blood oath of revenge, known as a \"Cholo\", against the police and the citizens of Los Angeles. Each man cuts his arm and bleeds in a glass bowl.\n\nThat afternoon, CHIP Officer Ethan Bishop (Austin Stoker) goes out for a drive. Over his CB radio, he is disappointed to learn that his first night as a CHP police lieutenant will be spent supervising the decommissioning of the Anderson precinct, aka Precinct 13.\n\nAt 5:11 p.m., special agent Starker (Charles Cyphers) arrives at the Los Cruces prison to transport three prisoners to the state prison in Sonora, California. The warden (John J. Fox) introduces him to the convicts: Wells (Tony Burton), a muscular African-American man; Cornell (Peter Frankland), an ill and skinny white man; and Napoleon Wilson (Darwin Joston), a violent, psychotic death row inmate, shackled to a chair in his jail cell. The warden knocks Wilson off the chair without provocation, then leads him outside where Wilson wraps his chains around the Warden's legs and pulls him off his feet, forcing the Starker and the guards to restrain Wilson in gunpoint.\n\nMeanwhile, Lawson (Martin West) and his young daughter, Kathy (Kim Richards), drive by the Anderson precinct looking for Kathy's nanny's house. They pass the gang four leaders, who screw silencers onto their automatic weapons and go out looking for people to kill.\n\nLater, Bishop arrives at Anderson and meets his skeleton crew: Julie (Nancy Loomis), a switchboard operator; Leigh (Laurie Zimmer), a secretary; and Chaney (Henry Brandon), an elderly police sergeant. Bishop is briefed by the departing police captain that only two shotguns are left in the precinct and he will be relieved at 4 a.m.; the precinct will close at 10 a.m.\n\nMeanwhile, on the prison bus, Cornell has a coughing fit so bad that Starker orders the driver to go to the nearest police precinct.\n\nAt 6:18 p.m., Lawson stops at a phone booth to phone for directions, while Kathy runs over to an ice cream truck. The ice cream driver (Peter Bruni) is distracted by a black car that keeps circling the block. After Kathy skips away with her ice cream, the driver is pulled out of the truck by the white gang leader (Frank Doubleday). Realizing she got the wrong flavor, Kathy comes back to the truck and is shot by the gang leader, who then fatally shoots the driver. Lawson finishes his call and sees Kathy lying by the truck. Cradling Kathy's body, Lawson sees the black car drive away and the driver lives long enough to tell him that the gun is in a holder next to the steering wheel. Lawson grabs it, gets into his car and chases after the gang.\n\nMeanwhile, the police bus arrives at Anderson, and a reluctant Bishop allows Starker to use the holding cells, while he calls a doctor.\n\nAt 7:00 p.m., Lawson chases Kathy's killers into a field until they jump out of their car and run. Lawson kills the white gang leader, then realizes he is out of bullets, and runs to Anderson precinct. Collapsing at the front desk, Lawson is so traumatized that he can only say he is being followed. Ethan Bishop puts Lawson into the Captain's office and tries to call a doctor, but the phones and the lights suddenly go dead. Bishop at first believes it is an outside power failure, but the streetlights remain on. Starker decides to leave; however, when Chaney and Bishop step outside, Chaney is shot dead. Bishop runs back inside, and rushes to the holding cells, but is too late to prevent Starker, the two prison guards and Cornell from being gunned down as they step outside. Napoleon Wilson steals Starker's keys, but Bishop makes Starker give them to him after he gets Wilson and Wells back inside and into the holding cells.\n\nSalvos of bullets greet Bishop as he returns to the lobby. When the firing stops, he looks outside and sees everyone is gone. Leigh explains there is no rear exit to the building, and all the surrounding buildings are abandoned. As Bishop gives her his revolver and orders her to watch the windows, the gang's three remaining leaders appear throw the glass bowl of blood at the door and then lay a white sheet with the Street Thunder emblem on the front in front of the building before walking away. Sobbing, Julie pleads with Bishop to give the gang Lawson, but he refuses.\n\nThe shooting resumes, and Bishop hands Leigh the cell keys, ordering her to free the prisoners. As she opens the cells, a thug breaks down the outside door and shoots her in her right arm. She smashes the man in the face with the key ring and opens the cell. She releases Wells and Wilson. Now unchained, Wilson dispatches another gang member who tries to stab him, and helps Leigh fights her way back to the lobby and barricades the door.\n\nDuring the assault, gang members smash through the windows. Bishop dons a rifle while he tosses Wilson a pump-action shotgun while Wells retrieves a gun from a slain gang member. Together, Bishop, Wilson, Wells and Leigh kill or wound more then a dozen gang members attempting to force their way into the building through the windows until they withdraw. When the fighting is over, they discover Julie is dead. Bishop notices an acetylene tank and exclaims that they could have been blown to pieces.\n\nLooking outside, Bishop sees that all the corpses have been removed to make it seem like nothing has happened. When Wells informs them he is leaving, Bishop stands in his way and Wells pulls his gun. Leigh steps between them, telling Wells he will be gunned down if he goes outside, then notices Wells is out of bullets. A quick check shows they have only eight bullets left (three in Bishop's rifle, three in Wilson's shotgun and two in Leigh's pistol).\n\nAt 8:18 pm, remembering that a tunnel runs from the basement to a manhole in the parking lot, Leigh explains someone could crawl out, and go for help. The two prisoners play a game to decide who goes out and Wells loses. He crawls out, hot-wires a car and drives off. When Wells stops at a phone booth, a gang member sits up in the back seat and shoots him in the head.\n\nOut of options, Wilson recommends they retreat to the basement as it is easier to defend when they see the gang members in the distance gathering for a final assault. As they descend the stairs, carrying the still-comatose Lawson with them, Leigh asks Wilson why he did not try to escape and Wilson replies that there are only two things a man never leaves behind, one is a helpless man, but he does not say what the second is.\n\nBishop decides to make a final stand in the basement hallway; he wraps some flares around the acetylene tank, explaining that when the gang attacks, he will shoot the flares to detonate the tank. He and Wilson will use a huge metal sign to shield them from the blast.\n\nMeanwhile, two policemen patrolling the neighborhood call for backup when they find a dead telephone repairman hanging from a pole.\n\nBack at Precinct 13, the gang attacks by throwing Molotov cocktails through the windows and finally break into the building and eventually head down into the basement, but Wilson and Bishop use clubs to force them back. Leigh shoots a gang member coming in from the sewer entrance. When the hall is full, Bishop shoots the tank with his final bullet and it explodes.\n\nOutside the burning police station, when more police officers arrive and secure the station, the surviving gang members retreat. Venturing down into the basement, the police officers find dozens of dead and badly burned gang members strewn in the hallway, and the only survivors are Bishop, Leigh, Wilson, and the comatose Lawson. When a policeman tries to handcuff Wilson, Ethan Bishop pushes him away and says it will be a privilege if Wilson will walk out with him. The two leave the smoking basement."

    "Assault on Wall Street": "In the midst of the 2008 financial crisis, a portfolio-manager named Jeremy Stancroft (John Heard) instructs his employees to neglect the best-interest of clients in order to increase company profits.\n\nMeanwhile, Jim Baxford (Dominic Purcell), a former soldier and armored car driver, lives with his wife, Rosie (Erin Karpluk), in New York City. Rosie is in the process of recovering from a near-fatal brain tumor. Their health insurance has reached its limit, and Jim finds that he is unable to afford her continuing treatment. He decides to cash in the pension he earned from serving in the military, but learns that much of it is lost as a result of bad investments on the part of his financial adviser Sean (Edward Furlong). In addition, he finds himself in a $60,000 lawsuit as a result of bad real-estate investments conducted by his rogue financial adviser.\n\nJim frequently lunches with a colleague in the armored car business, and two NYPD friends. He borrows $10,000 from the colleague to pay for an attorney named Mr. Patterson (Eric Roberts) to sue his financial adviser, and arranges a meeting with an assistant district attorney to discuss wrongdoings on the part of his financial advisers. However, Mr. Patterson claims that he is unable to do anything and the assistant district attorney is unwilling to meet with him. Jim becomes frustrated at the loss of his money and his inability to pay for his wife's treatment and their mortgage. Because of his financial situation, his employer reluctantly fires him, as the company is not willing to trust him with large sums of money.\n\nRosie feels guilty for the financial strain that her illness has put on Jim and, unable to cope, commits suicide. Jim blames Wall Street financiers for ruining his life. Seeking vengeance, he purchases various firearms and grenades from an arms dealer, and begins a one-man army shooting spree on the Wall Street bosses that lost his money and contributed to the death of his wife. One by one, he kills those that have wronged him. Meeting with his friends at lunch, Jim casually admits to them that he is the Wall Street murderer. The three laugh it off, convinced he's joking.\n\nThe climax of the film has Jim staging a one-man assault and infiltration of a high-rise office building to confront and kill Jeremy Stancroft, the same ruthless and greedy banker who is indirectly responsible for Jim's financial situation. Jim plants a bomb across the street to act as a diversion and then assaults the office itself, ruthlessly shooting innocent office employees and staff in his path.\n\nSitting at Jeremy's desk, Jim tells Jeremy why he is targeting him, of his corruption and asks why he should let Jeremy live. The heartless Jeremy defends his actions, saying that the famous rich people of history didn't get rich by honest work and that capitalism is a survival of the fittest society, where the \"strong survive and the weak die off\". Jim shows him a picture of his wife and tells Jeremy he's the reason his wife is dead. Shortly as SWAT begins to approach the office, Jim puts the gun on the table and counts to three. Jeremy grabs the gun when Jim gets to two, bragging about how he \"won\". Jim accuses him of cheating. Not caring, Jeremy pulls the trigger, only to realize that the gun is empty, for Jim cheated too. Just then, SWAT smashes the window and shoots Jeremy dead. Jim pretends to be an innocent wounded victim, having been shot in the arm by a security guard earlier, and is escorted away by SWAT, who is convinced Stancroft was the perpetrator.\n\nA few minutes later, Jim stands in the lobby of the office building. He watches emergency personnel come and go, having just been treated for the gunshot wound to his arm. He is recognized there by one of his NYPD lunchmates, who had been called to the scene. Without a word, Jim is led out of the building by his friend to the street, to freedom. The film ends with Jim walking away, voicing over that he intends to continue his killing spree of white-collar businessmen elsewhere."

    "Asteroid": "An Asteroid is discovered, a city is evacuated. But then a bigger piece is revealed, the Govt plans to laser it, but only breaks it up. The smaller pieces slam into USA and the country copes with the aftermath. Deep Impact and Armageddon rolled into one.\n\nLate one night, near Billings, Montana, a gas tanker is driving by when a small meteor suddenly hits in front of the truck. The driver attempts to swerve out of the way, but loses control and overturns and the tanker explodes, causing a massive fire.\n\nThe next morning, the fire is burning out of control, and it is reported that the tanker was hit by a lightning bolt. With the area evacuated, FEMA Director Jack Wallach (Michael Biehn), and a colleague, Adam Marquez (Carlos Gomez) is flying via helicopter over the area, inspecting the fire, when they notice that two people are still in the area. It's a man on the roof of his house, trying to save it, despite his wife's protests.\n\nJack and Adam land and take the woman aboard, despite her angry protest in concern of her husband. Her husband starts to suffer from smoke inhalation when Jack manages to get him aboard the helicopter. Jack just barely manages to escape as a propane tank causes a massive explosion and destroys the home. They escape.\n\nLater that evening, at the National Observatory in Boulder, CO, 29-year-old widow Dr. Lily McKee (Annabella Sciorra), the director of the National Observatory, is observing a comet which is going to pass by Earth on the 4th of July. Later on, when she goes home and looks at some photos, she sees what she believes are asteroids.\n\nThe next day, she informs Jack and Adam of the possibility of an impact and calls them in. She tells them of two asteroids: Helios and Eros, whose orbits have been disrupted by the comet and may hit the Earth. Helios would hit with the force of 1,000 Hiroshima bombs and generate temperatures five times hotter than the sun in the area of impact. Everything within a 150-mile radius would be destroyed and the impact would also spray molten rock another 70 miles.\n\nEros is 4 miles across and would cause a global ecological disaster if it did indeed hit. Then, Max Jenson (Brian Hill), one of Lily's assistants, informs Lily, Jack and Adam that Helios is getting closer to the Earth and that the observatory in Mauna Kea, Hawaii had picked up some smaller asteroids that the National Observatory cannot see, and they believe that a small one hit Montana. Jack and Adam realize that the fire was indeed caused by an asteroid impact.\n\nLater on, Lily and Max check Helios' trajectory and realize that it will indeed hit the Earth. Their numbers show that Helios will hit in the Kansas City, Missouri area within about 48 hours. They tell the president about it and he orders that the city be evacuated ASAP. Ultimately Helios does hit, but it breaks up in Earth's atmosphere and only a fragment hits that causes major flooding as it destroys a dam, but the loss of life is minimal.\n\nUnfortunately, it is discovered Eros will hit also and will be an extinction-level event. The United States uses three jet fighters each armed with a laser weapon to try a coordinated air-to-space attack to destroy the asteroid with support from the entire world, but due to a storm, the attack is only partially successful and although it destroys the asteroid itself, it breaks it up into many pieces that rain down on Earth. The biggest fragment hit Dallas, Texas where Lilly's son and father are and destroys the city, killing thousands.\n\nLily desperately searches the city for her father and son who survive, but her father ends up trapped and hurt and her son Elliot wanders off trying to find help. After a search, Lilly locates her father and with the help of nearby firemen, rescues him, but goes on to try to rescue Elliot while the soldier who accompanied her goes back to base, although a fireman does accompany her. The two search the ruined city and finally locate Elliot in the crater at Ground Zero of the Eros fragment impact. Jack shows up to help in a helicopter, having learned their location from Lilly's former escort. He rescues Elliot and the four return to base where they watch the comet pass by Earth and are relieved it won't return to cause trouble for another 4,000 years."

When a robot fails to have a use any longer, it is pitched over the side onto the cluttered landscape far below. Toby Tenma is a boy genius visits his dad at his office. Finds his dad talking to President Stone, who with Dr Tenma and Dr Elefun are creating a Peacekeeping robot, which he hopes will help him be re-elected.\n\nDr Elefun explains that using a fallen star, he was able to synthesize both a positive and negative energy effect from this star. Stone uses the red core, and places this in the Peacekeeping robot, which turns it into a negative force & increase its weaponry. The group manages to get behind a shield to stop the robot from destroying them, but Toby is vaporized. Heartbroken, Dr Tenma works with Dr Elefun to create a robotic duplicate of Toby. Dr Elefun provides Tenma with the blue energy core to power the new Toby. But Tenma can't take the robot as his son, so Elefun releases him on his own.\n\nBut, President Stone, eager to get hold of the Blue core, finds Toby flying through the city & orders his capture. Stone attempts to destroy Toby to get the blue core but ends up blowing Toby off Metro City to the ground below. Toby is found by a group of kids, scavenging for old parts.

They live in an orphanage run by Hamegg himself. Hamegg tells Astro that he was a scientist in the Ministry of Science & worked with Tanma before he was kicked for his ideas. Cora tells Astro that Hamegg repairs robots to fight in the robot games. Astro helps power up a huge construction robot (ZOG) using his blue core & brings it to Hamegg.\n\nCora attempts to call her parents in Metro city, can't get through & is sad that they have abandoned her. Hamegg takes Zog to robot wars where robots are used as fodder to fight against one another. Hamegg zaps Astro & tells the kids that he knows that Astro is a human looking robot.\n\nHamegg pegs Astro against Zog. Zog refuses to fight Astro, until Hamegg prods him. Zog attempts to kill Hamegg, breaking the 1st rule of robotics, until Astro saves Hamegg. But in doing so, he is spotted by Stone's troop who capture him & bring him to Tenma for deactivation. Tenma initially agrees, but then refuses, & releases Astro. In anger, Stone injects the red core into the peacekeeper robot.\n\nThe robot immediately starts assimilating other robots & grows in size & power. He attacks Metro City & Astro confronts him. But even can't fight this ever-growing robot. His friends, Cora & others, arrive in the nick of time to save Astro & whisk him away from the Red robot.\n\nThe giant smashes the power supply of Metro City & it starts falling to Earth, Astro goes back in & supports the whole city & prevents it from crashing, instead it floats gently back to ground. Then Astro realizes that the only way to kill the giant robot is to merge the red & blue cores together. But that would kill Astro too. Astro dives headfirst into the giant & merges the cores. Killing both. Tenma is distraught, but then Zog spares some of his blue core energy (that Astro gave him), to revive Astro's blue core & everyone's happy."

    "Asuran": "In the late 1970s Tirunelveli, a man and a boy are trekking across a river, carrying homemade bombs. In another part of the village, a woman, man and a girl are also hiding from the police.\n\nPast: The narrator reveals that the man is Sivasaami and the boy is his son Chidambaram. In contrast, the woman, man, and child are Sivasaami's wife, Pachaiyamma, her brother Murugesan and daughter Lakshmi. They also had an older son called Velmurugan. They are a family of farmers living in Thekkoor (lit. southern village). Sivasaami has a close relationship with his older son but is distant, almost abusive with Chidambaram. Sivasaami's family, along with most residents of Thekkoor, are Dalits. Narasimhan is an upper-caste landlord from Vadakoor (lit. northern village), who needs Sivasaami's 3 acres of land for a factory, to which the family is against selling, especially Velmurugan.\n\nPachaiyamma is attacked by one of Narasimhan's sons, to which Velmurugan retaliates by severely injuring him and his men and gets imprisoned consequently. Sivasaami pleads with Narasimhan to get Velmurugan released, and in reply, Narasimhan asks Sivasaami to prostrate before every male resident of the landlord's village as atonement. When Velmurugan hears of his father's humiliation, he beats Narasimhan with a slipper. In revenge, Narasimhan's henchmen, led by a hunter Kariyan, behead Velmurugan and dumps his headless body naked in their field. Pachaiyamma is broken with inability to even complain because of the missing head as evidence and after a year, Chidambaram is compelled to kill Narasimhan in revenge. Sivasaami sees the killing, cuts the street lights there, and tells the family, where they flee with Chidambaram.\n\nPresent: Kariyan is asked to find the pair, tracks them down, and almost kills Chidambaram. Sivasami defeats them all but kills none. While the two recovers, Sivasaami explains why he spared their lives.\n\nPast: 20 years before, he was a village-famous moonshine brewer and trusted servant to Viswanathan, a landlord. One day, he convinces his boss to employ Pandiyan, Viswanathan's distant relative, as a clerk. Sivasaami's brother Murugan and Venugopal Seshadri, a Brahmin Communist lawyer, are attempting to regain their community's Panchami land from landlords who had seized it illegally. Sivasaami's elder sister's daughter Mariyamma proposes to Sivasami, who accepts. The family also accepts. Pandiyan slowly gains Viswanathan's trust and becomes his Mill accountant.\n\nMeanwhile, Sivasaami slowly falls in love with Mariyamma. When Sivasaami gives her sandals to wear, Pandiyan hits her and forces her to walk through the village with the sandals on her head. Sivasaami retaliates by hitting him with sandals in the middle of the village and ties him up, but is reprimanded by Vishwanathan. Sivasaami quits brewing and joins his brother. One night, before a meeting was conducted by Seshadri and Murugan with the other labourers, news arrives that Seshadri was arrested, and Sivasaami is sent to get the documents authorising the meeting. When Sivasami returns, Murugan and the others have been killed by Pandiyan and his men, while Sivasaami's family (including Mariyamma), along with many others, are burned alive in their huts.\n\nEnraged, Sivasaami brutally kills Vishwanathan, Pandiyan and their men. Sivasaami leaves his village and months later was found by Murugesan, who taught him farming. He's also introduced to Pachaiyamma, who is not getting marriage proposals. He narrates his story, and Pachaiyamma admires what he did for his family. He surrenders to the court and is given a light sentence. Afterwards, he marries Pachaiyamma.\n\nPresent: Chidambaram is amazed at his father's past and starts to admire him. Sivasaami reconciles with his wife and daughter briefly, and he and his son go to Seshadri for help. Seshadri agrees to help them as long as they turn up to court the next day. The next day, the two get into the court premises but are forced to flee after Narasimhan's men ambush them. Sivasaami reluctantly sells his land to prevent Narasimhan's men from targeting his family. However, Chidambaram is abducted and tortured, in direct violation of the agreement. Sivasaami kills many of the henchmen and all of Narasimhan's family male members, though he and Chidambaram sustain serious injuries.\n\nMurugesan and their village people arrive armed and defuse the situation. The two villages agreed that the conflict should end and prevented a caste clash. Sivasaami's family has gathered in the court, and he has agreed to go to prison instead of Chidambaram if necessary. He tells his son to study hard and get a powerful bureaucratic job, and that, unlike land and money, the landlords can't seize their education, where Sivasaami smiles at his family as he enters the court."

    "Atomic Blonde": "In 1989, before the collapse of the Berlin Wall, MI6 agent James Gasciogne (Sam Hargrave) is shot and killed by KGB agent Yuri Bakhtin, who steals the List, a piece of microfilm concealed in a wristwatch that contains the names of every active field agent in the Soviet Union. The list was provided to Gasciogne by a informant code-name Spyglass, who was promised immunity by the MI6. The list can extend the cold war for another 40 years, so all governments are after it and Yuri is still in Berlin. Ten days later, Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron), a top-level spy for MI6, is brought in to be interrogated by MI6 executive Eric Gray (Toby Jones) and CIA agent Emmett Kurzfeld (John Goodman) about her mission to Berlin. The rest of the movie is in flashback.\n\nThe day after Gasciogne's death, Lorraine is dispatched to Berlin to recover the List and assassinate Satchel, a double agent who has sold intelligence to the Soviets for years and who betrayed Gascoigne. The list is supposed to contain the identity of Satchel, which is why MI6 is interested in it. Meanwhile Spyglass has contacted David Percival MI6 top man in Berlin to inform him that he has delivered the list to Gasciogne. Percival refuses to take Spyglass since Gasciogne didn't show up and he still doesn't have the list. Spyglass says that he has it memorized. When she arrives in Berlin, she is immediately ambushed by KGB agents working for arms dealer and KGB associate Aleksander Bremovych (Roland M\u00f8ller), but is able to escape thanks to her main contact, agent David Percival (James McAvoy), showing up to help. Percival says that he has never met Spyglass. Bremovych is also looking for Bkahtin for the list and knows Bakhtin is trying hard to sell it. After failing to find any immediate leads, Lorraine searches Gascoigne's apartment and discovers a picture of him and Percival, and is then ambushed by the West German police. She realizes only Percival knew she was going to the apartment, and begins to suspect him of being Satchel. Lorraine also encounters Delphine Lasalle (Sofia Boutella), a naive French agent, and enters into a relationship with her. Lasalle has been tracking Lorraine since she landed in Berlin.\n\nBakhtin declares his intention to sell the List to the highest bidder. Percival, having been tipped off, kills him and takes the List for himself. He then meets with Bremovych, which Lasalle photographs. Percival meets Lorraine & now informs her that Spyglass has memorized the list and wants to defect. Lorraine is upset that Percival did not reveal this before, else she would have prioritized the extraction of Spyglass. The same night Percival called Eric and told him that he had the list and knew the identity of Satchel. This was not known to Lorraine. Percival offers to escort the defector who stole and memorized the List, a Stasi officer code-named Spyglass (Eddie Marsan), and his family across the border to West Berlin. Lorraine offers to help & makes her own arrangements. Percival has shooters on top to take out Spyglass, but Lorraine hides herself and Spyglass behind umbrellas to thwart the shooters. However, Pervical shoots Spyglass and tips off Bremovych's men, and despite Lorraine's best efforts, Spyglass is killed. At this point, it is very clear to Lorraine that Pervical has betrayed her and Spyglass. It turns out that Lasalle was following Lorraine on Percival's instructions. But now Lasalle knows that Percival has met Bremovych & threatens him. Percival warns her that she doesn't know who she is dealing with (referring to Lorraine). Percival then goes to Lasalle's apartment and kills her to cover his own tracks. When Lorraine arrives too late to save her, she discovers the photographs taken by Lasalle proving Percival to be Satchel. As Percival burns his safe-house and attempts to flee, Lorraine tracks him down, kills him, and takes the List. Lorraine reveals that he had met Bremovych as the real target that day was not Spyglass, but Lorraine. Percival wanted the KGB to eliminate Lorraine. He knew that Spyglass was a liability to everyone and thus had to eliminated as well and that Lorraine was the real Satchel.\n\nReturning to the MI6 debriefing, Lorraine presents photographs as well as spliced audio recordings painting Percival as a traitor, and denies knowing the List's current whereabouts, forcing the agency to close the case. Three days later, she meets with Bremovych in Paris, revealing herself to be Satchel. Lorraine gives him a fake List, but Bremovych admits he knows she set him up. Lorraine kills his henchmen, and before killing him reveals she was manipulating events from the very beginning. Later in Paris she meets with Kurzfeld, revealing herself to be an American triple agent planted by the CIA, before returning with him to Langley."

    "Attack of the Gryphon": "The main narrative is set in a mythical land where, about 300 years before, two princes named Lock and Delphus fought for their father's throne. Although Lock killed Delphus in single combat, their father's kingdom of Vallon was torn into rival nations, Lockland and Delphi.\n\nThe story flashes forward from this prologue to the eve of Lockland's destruction, when the castle is besieged and the crown prince, the last surviving son of the King of Lockland, is killed in action by invading Delphites. Against the counsel of the prince's sister Amelia (Amber Benson), their father, the Locklander king, turns to his chief sorcerer Armand (Larry Drake) in despair. The sorcerer convinces the king to give him a handful of his blood with which to animate a stone statue of a gryphon, a flying beast that is the totem of Lockland. Using the blood to bind the gryphon to him, Armand first orders it to break the Delphite siege, then betrays his king and calls it back to attack the Locklanders in a coup. It is seen that the sorcerer suffers the physical effects of any attack against the gryphon, but regenerates almost immediately due to his bond with the beast.\n\nPrincess Amelia escapes during the takeover and pursues the retreating Locklanders, led the Delphite prince Seth (Jonathan LaPaglia), who had been in the vanguard of the besieging forces. Having inherited the gift of magical visions from his parents, the prince is advised by his mother Cassandra (Sarah Douglas), a sorceress, to seek an artifact called the Draconian Pike, the only weapon that can kill the gryphon. His mother warns him that he must retrieve the two halves of the pike and reassemble it to kill the gryphon before a solar eclipse occurs in two weeks, or Armand will be able to enact a ritual that makes himself and the beast immortal.\n\nAmelia and her retinue capture Seth and his man-at-arms, David (Andrew Pleavin), during a night raid on their camp in a location called The Valley of the Dead. They locate the haft of the Draconian Pike in a centuries-old temple. Fending off an attack by the gryphon by means of \"dragon's fire\" (apparently black powder or an explosive variant of Greek fire), they escape and move on to seeking the blade. Meanwhile, Armand attempts to foment mistrust between the two rival nations by killing a Locklander messenger and sending his body to Amelia's father, a threat against her life magically scored into his chest. The king of Lockland calls for his armor and mounts a counter-invasion of Delphi. Meanwhile, Amelia confronts Seth at knife-point in his tent, demanding that he tell her where the blade is, but she lets her guard down momentarily and he takes advantage, seizing the knife; they fall into an amorous embrace.\n\nThat same night, Armand sends his two magic-wielding brides, Daphne and Kyra, to seduce one of the Locklander soldiers into stealing the haft piece from Amelia and Seth. When Seth and Amelia find it gone the next morning, they decide to send messengers to their respective parents to muster the combined armies of Lockland and Delphi. Amelia and her remaining knights attack Armand's lair, while Seth and his retainer David enter a magically-warded labyrinth to retrieve the blade.\n\nThe two kings call a truce and their armies prepare for a massed assault, while the gryphon prepares to destroy them. Queen Cassandra of Delphi bids her husband farewell and rides into the deserted stronghold of the enemy. Once Seth retrieves the blade, he rushes to the sorcerer's lair to confront him, but finds his path blocked by the sorcerer's brides. Cassandra tells her son to leave the sorceresses to her and go to dispatch the gryphon, sacrificing herself in a magical strike against them.\n\nMeanwhile, Armand has captured Amelia and killed the Locklander knight champion, and demands that she become his bride. Seth and David arrive and fight with the sorcerer, but soon loses the blade of the Draconian Pike. Assembling the pike, Armand kills David and prepares to kill the Delphite Prince, but is persuaded to spare him by the surrender of Amelia. As the eclipse begins, Armand proclaims that he will soon become an immortal and that his progeny with Amelia will be the new Titans. As he walks away from the defeated Delphite Prince, his hand touches Amelia's belly and he realizes that she is already pregnant with the prince's child. Furious, he rejects her and prepares to kill them both. A struggle ensues and Armand again knocks the prince to his knees, but is unable to deliver the coup de grace because the Delphite queen's spirit still protects her son. The sorcerer calls the gryphon down on the prince, to whom the princess tosses the Draconian Pike. It appears as if Seth is charging for the sorcerer, but instead hops onto a rock and turns just in time to level the pike at the stooping gryphon, impaling it. The gryphon reverts to stone and shatters as it falls to the ground, while the sorcerer dissolves into a pool of blood.\n\nThe armies of Lockland and Delphi rejoice at their deliverance, cheering as Amelia and Seth raise the reassembled Draconian Pike overhead to symbolize the reunion of the sundered kingdoms of Vallon. In a voiceover, Amelia proclaims that the curse of civil war has been lifted."

    "Attack on Darfur": "The plot of Darfur revolves around six Western journalists who visit a small village in Darfur in western Sudan under the escort of a squad of troops of the African Union peacekeeping mission. When they learn the brutal state sponsored militia called the Janjaweed are heading towards the village, they are faced with an impossible decision: leave Sudan and report the atrocities to the world, or risk their own lives and stay in the hopes of averting a certain slaughter.\n\nWhile most of them flee back to their base, two of the journalists, Freddie Smith, and Theo Schwartz, decide to stay behind along with the Nigarian commander of the AU unit, Captain Jack Tobamke, to try to save the villagers when the Arab Janjaweed enter the village and begin to indiscriminaly kill all the men, women, and children. Despite their efforts to save some villagers, Captain Tobamke, Theo, and Freddie are all killed one by one in the subsequent shootout with the Janjaweed, but not after killing or wounding a few dozen of the savage milita. The surviving Janjaweed then burn the village to the ground and move on, presumably to continue their genocide rampage across the Darfur landscape.\n\nThe final scene shows the female member of the journalist team, Malin Lausberg, who fled with most of the other reporters and AU soldiers during the Janjaweed attack, return to the destroyed village the next day with a group of AU soldiers only to find everyone dead, including two of her colleagues. But she finds an infant that Freddie protected by hiding under his dead body as the sole survivor of the massacre. Malin takes the baby with her as she and the rest of the AU troops leave the destroyed village behind."

    "Attack the Block": "Walking home on Bonfire Night, Samantha Adams (Jodie Whittaker), a 25-year-old trainee nurse, is mugged by a small gang of teenage hoodlums: Pest (Alex Esmail), Dennis (Franz Drameh), Jerome (Leeon Jones), Biggz (Simon Howard), and leader Moses (John Boyega). The attack is interrupted when a meteorite falls from the sky into a nearby car, giving Samantha the chance to escape. As Moses searches the wreck of the car for valuables, his face is scratched by a pale, hairless, eyeless dog-sized creature; the object which fell from the sky was its cocoon. The creature runs away, but the gang chase and kill it. Hoping to gain fame and fortune, they take the corpse to their acquaintance, cannabis dealer Ron (Nick Frost), to get advice on what to do. He lives at the top of their tower block, Wyndham Tower.\n\nMoses asks Ron and his boss, Hi-Hatz (Jumayn Hunter), to keep the creature in their fortified \"weed room\" while he decides how to proceed. More objects fall from the sky. Eager to fight the creatures, the gang arm themselves and go to the nearest crash site. However, they find these aliens are much larger, gorilla-sized, with spiky fur which is so black it reflects no light, huge claws and rows of glowing fangs. Fleeing the aliens, the gang are intercepted by two policemen and Moses is arrested, identified as a mugger by Samantha. The aliens, following Moses, maul the police to death and attack their van, leaving Samantha and Moses trapped inside. Dennis reaches the vehicle and drives the van away, only to crash into Hi-Hatz's car. Samantha runs away while the rest of Moses's gang catch up and confront Hi-Hatz.\n\nEnraged by the damage to his car, Hi-Hatz threatens them with a gun, refusing to believe their story of aliens, until his henchman is attacked by one, allowing the gang to escape. The gang try to flee to Wyndham Tower but are again followed and attacked en route by the aliens, where Biggz is forced to hide in a recycling bin and Pest is severely bitten in the leg. They find that Samantha lives in their building, force their way into her flat, and persuade her to treat Pest's leg. An alien bursts in and Moses kills it with a samurai sword through the head. Understanding that the group was not lying about the creatures being extraterrestrial, Samantha reasons that it is safer to stay with the gang than on her own and joins them. The gang moves upstairs to the flat owned by Tia (Danielle Vitalis), Dimples (Paige Meade), Dionna (Gina Antwi) and Gloria (Natasha Jonas) believing that their security gate will keep them safe. The aliens instead attack from outside, climbing up the side of the tower block and smashing through the windows, one of whom decapitates Dennis.\n\nAfter Samantha saves Moses' life from one of the aliens, the girls believe them to be the focus of the creatures and kick the gang out of the flat. In the hall, the gang is attacked by Hi-Hatz and more henchmen. The gang escapes while an alien chases Hi-Hatz and his henchmen into a lift. Hi-Hatz kills the alien, though his henchmen perish, and continues his search for Moses. Making their way upstairs to Ron's weed room, the gang runs into more aliens, but using fireworks as a distraction, they manage to get through. Jerome, however, becomes disoriented in the smoke and is killed by an alien. Entering Ron's flat they find that Hi-Hatz is already there. Hi-Hatz prepares to shoot Moses but hordes of aliens smash through the window and tear off his face. Now joined by Brewis (Luke Treadaway), one of Ron's customers, Moses, Pest and Samantha retreat into the weed room, while Ron hides in the flat.\n\nBiggz, still trapped in the bin by a lurking alien, is saved by two unruly children, Probs (Sammy Williams) and Mayhem (Michael Ajao), using a water-gun filled with petrol and a flame to torch the creature from a safe distance. In the weed room, Brewis notices a luminescent stain on Moses' jacket under the ultraviolet light. As a zoology student, Brewis theorizes that the aliens are like spores, drifting through space on solar winds until they chance on a suitable planet. After landing in an area with enough food, the female lets off a strong pheromone which will attract the male creatures to it so that they can mate and propagate their species in their new world. Brewis suggests that the smaller, hairless alien which Moses killed in the beginning was such a female and it had left a mating scent on Moses that the larger male aliens have been tracking throughout the evening. The gang form a plan for Samantha, who has not been stained with the pheromone, to go to Moses's flat and turn on the gas oven.\n\nMoses forces Pest to return the ring they stole from her, feeling guilty for having mugged her. Samantha successfully avoids the aliens, turns on the gas and leaves the Block. Moses, with the dead female alien strapped to his back, rushes out of the weed room and into his flat, while the males converge on the scent and chase Moses through the block. Inside his flat he throws the female into the kitchen and the males follow. Using fireworks, Moses ignites the gas-filled room and leaps out of the window. The explosion engulfs the flat and the aliens, but Moses survives, clinging to a Union Flag hanging from the side of the building. In the aftermath, Moses, Pest, Brewis and Ron are arrested, considered responsible for the deaths around the Block including the two policemen who had earlier arrested Moses. Samantha, however, comes to their defense. In the back of the police van, Moses and Pest hear the residents of the Block cheering for Moses."

    "Ava": "Ava Faulkner (Jessica Chastain) is a recovering addict and former soldier turned assassin. In France, she kidnaps her new target, an English businessman Peter Hamilton (Ioan Gruffudd), a financial advisor to the International Monetary Fund. Before she kills him, she questions him on why someone wants him dead. Unbeknownst to her, another woman electronically eavesdrops on the conversation. It is later revealed that Peter had stolen funds from the IMF, money laundering and election tampering.\n\nAfterwards, Ava flies to Boston where she visits with her estranged sister Judy (Jess Weixler) and her mother Bobbi (Geena Davis) who is hospitalized for angina pain. Ava has not seen them in eight years. Unknown to Ava, she is being tracker during her visit to Boston. Ava was a straight A student, who had an accident in which she lost her will to live. She took to drugs. She served in the army, where she met her handler, Duke. She got an honorable discharge from the army, had difficulty adjusting to civilian life and finally joined Duke's private assassins' company.\n\nAva's handler and former Army superior, Duke (John Malkovich), sends her to Saudi Arabia to kill a German general. Duke had insisted that this is a sensitive operation and that the death had to look like from natural causes. Ava lures the general into a trap and injects him with a poison to make it appear he died of a heart attack. She is interrupted by the general's security guards (Ava had used the general's close friend's family name to get close to him. But the intel got the name wrong. It was O'Sullivan and not Sullivan). A gunfight ensues, leaving all the men dead. She escapes the hotel, but her pic is captured on CCTV. She has to fight through the streets of Riyadh to get away. Ava escapes and travels to Barneville-Carteret (Normandy coast) where Duke apologizes for the botched operation, insisting that the bad intel was a simple mistake. He gives her time off to decompress and she returns to Boston and meets Michael (Common), her former fiance who is now in a relationship with her sister Judy.\n\nIn British Columbia, Duke meets with his superior, Simon (Colin Farrell). Simon's daughter Camille (Diana Silvers) is the woman who had earlier eavesdropped on Ava's hit. Simon believes Ava is a liability and that her questioning of targets demonstrates insufficient commitment to their operation. After Duke leaves, Simon reaffirms the hit on Ava. He also confirms to Camille that he made the intel mistake deliberately in Riyadh, so Ava would get killed and Duke would never suspect him. Ava kills her attacker and then confronts Duke who insists that it was a random drug addict attack. He also convinces Ava that the Company had nothing to do with the attack on her. That night, Ava goes to dinner with Judy and Michael, but their conversation does not go well (Judy feels that Michael is still interested in Ava and is ignoring her). The next morning, Judy meets Ava and tells her Michael is missing. Realizing he has started gambling again, Ava rescues him from a gambling den run by a woman, Toni (Joan Chen), to whom Michael is indebted (for $75K).\n\nDuke revisits Simon and reveals he knew Ava was set up. A fight ensues between the two men, resulting in Simon killing Duke. He sends a video of Duke's death to Ava. A heartbroken Ava goes to Judy's house, where she invites Michael to run away with her, but he declines, revealing that Judy is pregnant. Ava heads to Toni's den where she kills some of her men before giving Toni a bag of money to pay off Michael's debt. Ava starts to strangle Toni, and is about to break her neck, but then changes her mind, letting her live while warning her to stay away from Michael.\n\nBack at her hotel, Ava is attacked by Simon. They fight, with both sustaining serious injuries. Exhausted, Simon flees when the fire alarm goes off, warning Ava that he will kill her if he sees her again. Ava pursues Simon, cornering and killing him under the Zakim Bridge. Ava goes to her sister's house, warning Judy to leave the country and giving her the number to a Swiss bank account filled with Ava's earnings. Before she leaves, Michael gives her a letter from Duke, who says that he is happy with how his life turned out. As she walks down the street, Ava is stalked by Simon's daughter, Camille."

    "Avalanche": "Caroline Brace (Mia Farrow) checks into the newly opened ski resort owned by her ex-husband, David Shelby (Rock Hudson). Delighted to run into her former mother-in-law, Florence Shelby (Jeanette Nolan), Caroline joins her on a tour of the facility with Florence and David's accountant, Henry McDade (Steve Franken). To increase publicity of the resort's grand opening, David has invited winter sports stars such as a ski jump champion named Gary; the downhill skier and notorious playboy, Bruce Scott (Rick Moses); and Olympic skaters Cathy Jordan (Pat Egan) and Annette River (Peggy Browne).\n\nGreeting Caroline, David relates his pride in the resort and the struggle it took to build it, noting that he may be implicated in an investigation of a planning commissioner. Putting his woes aside, he expresses his desire to reconcile with Caroline. Meanwhile, on the skating rink, Cathy stumbles at the end of her routine and despite her coach's assurances, she worries that she'll never get it right.\n\nOut on one of the resort's hillsides, McDade and Florence encounter Nick Thorne (Robert Forster), a nature photographer who warns that the removal of the trees is rendering the slope unstable. Vowing to remind David of the environmental hazards at the resort, Nick tosses a snowball that easily rolls down the mountain.\n\nElsewhere, Bruce is trying out the ski course when a small avalanche breaks above him. Racing ahead of the oncoming snow, Bruce is forced high up into a tree for safety. When the avalanche eventually stops, he jumps down on the snow and skies away.\n\nLater, Nick flags David down, insisting they talk about conditions on the mountain and David introduces Caroline as his wife to Nick. After Caroline leaves, Nick argues with David and ski patrol ranger, Phil Prentiss (Jerry Douglas), about whether enough precautions have been taken to safeguard the resort. Nick departs, running into Caroline who is swimming in the resort's pool. During a flirtatious exchange with Nick, Caroline clarifies that she's David's ex-wife and she expresses interest in seeing Nick at the party that night. As Nick heads outside, he sneaks explosives out of Phil's truck. Meanwhile, David greets popular talk show host Mark Elliott (Barry Primus) and informs Mark that his wife Tina is at the resort with Bruce.\n\nThat night, Nick makes an unexpected appearance at the party and incites David's jealousy as he dances with Caroline. After arguing with David, Caroline goes home with Nick. In another cabin, Tina finds Bruce in bed with Annette, which sends her screaming into the snow in her underwear.\n\nIn the morning, Nick leaves Caroline in bed to check out conditions on the mountain while Tina returns to argue with Bruce about his infidelity.\n\nIn his office, David orders his lawyer, Marty Brenner (X Brands), to come to the resort to deal with the commissioner's investigation regardless of the dangerous flying conditions.\n\nUp on the mountain, Nick uses the purloined explosives to safely release pressure on a precariously dangling snow shelf.\n\nBack at the lodge, David presides over various grand opening celebrations and events while Mark Elliott covers the events on his talk show before taking a break to ski. As Mark boards the lift, he notices a little boy named Jason whose parents were going to leave him behind, and takes Jason up the mountain with him.\n\nJust then, Marty's airplane crashes into the mountain, triggering a massive avalanche. The snow sweeps away all people on the lift, including Jason's parents, and knocks Gary down in the middle of his ski jump. Bruce races downhill to outrun the avalanche, but this time the snow overtakes him. Caroline watches the disaster from Nick's place, where she is protected from the devastation by the house's remote location.\n\nAt the ice rink, where David judges the competition from the observation booth, Cathy finally successfully completes her skating routine, just before the avalanche crushes her. The lodge collapses, crushing Tina in her room just as she's about to commit suicide and trapping Florence and McDade in the dining room. When the avalanche subsides, the survivors take stock of the situation. Mark and Jason are stranded on the ski lift as Nick digs through the snow to rescue Phil near the ranger station. When David crawls out of the collapsed observation booth and encounters Phil, the men decide to use the rest of Phil's explosives to clear a path into the hotel and free any trapped guests.\n\nAt the lodge, David and Caroline reunite and look for Florence.\n\nOn the mountain, Annette is desperate to find Bruce, who is stuck upside down in an air pocket, submerged in snow. Though Bruce tries to alert rescuers to his location, it is too late to save his life. David and McDade dig toward each other and finally create a way out of the lodge. Florence is unconscious from a gas leak, but Caroline saves her with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, then accompanies her to the hospital on the ambulance.\n\nMeanwhile, the ski lift chair falls away, leaving Mark and Jason swinging from the lift line. As rescuers set a net under them, Jason drops to safety, but before Mark can join him, the lift line is momentarily reconnected to its power source and he is electrocuted.\n\nDavid learns that Florence's route to the hospital may be cut off so he and Nick race to find her. Just then, the speeding ambulance skids on the ice and spins out of control. As the vehicle goes over the bridge and explodes, Caroline is thrown outside and left clinging to a weak railing. Nick and David arrive just in time to rescue her, and David realizes Florence is dead.\n\nBack at the destroyed resort, Caroline says goodbye to Nick and goes to see David. As they toast their survival with a bottle of champagne that Caroline finds, David says he knows he is the cause of the devastation and the end of their marriage. Caroline marvels at his admission. As Caroline leaves the resort in a taxi, David stands alone in the wreckage of his empire."

    "Avalanche Express": "At a gathering of high-ranking Soviet Union officials in Moscow, General Marenkov (Robert Shaw), the head of the government security agency K.G.B, reveals that there has been a breach of Project Winter Harvest, a plan to establish a Soviet network of biological warfare devices throughout Europe. After the meeting, Marenkov requests that the Project's Director, Colonel Nikolai Bunin, travel to Zurich, Switzerland, to assist in trapping the suspected culprit, a spy known by the code name Angelo.\n\nAt a train station in Switzerland, a team of American intelligence agents, led by Colonel Harry Wargrave (Lee Marvin) and his associates, Elsa Lang (Linda Evans), Leroy (Joe Nameth) and Neckerman (Arthur Brauss), retrieves the latest cassette tape sent by their Soviet informant Angelo. The tape is discreetly transferred among Wargrave's team until it reaches the hands of Haller, the superior officer, who is waiting on a private jet. After decoding the recording, Haller, Harry and Elsa listen as Angelo announces that this tape will be his final one and requests that the Americans meet him next Friday in Milan, Italy, during the noon tour at the La Scala opera house. Angelo explains that the position of the militarist hardliners is becoming more powerful in the Soviet Union, and subsequently Project Winter Harvest has been reactivated under the leadership of Bunin. With his cover threatened, he plans to defect immediately.\n\nThree days later during the opera house tour, Harry and Leroy wait for the rendezvous with Angelo whom they have never met. Suddenly, from behind the curtain of a private box, Marenkov reveals himself to be the informer, Angelo. While escorting Marenkov to a safe house in Milan, the Americans subdue and foil enemy agents who try and stop them. Because Marenkov is the third most powerful official in the Soviet Union, Haller suggests they need to bury him in a missile site to protect him. On the contrary, Marenkov wants to give the Soviets and Bunin a chance to come after him, which will expose the Soviet network of elite undercover agents and provide the Americans with a chance to defeat Bunin and Winter Harvest.\n\nMeanwhile at a covert location in Zurich, Bunin receives a telegram from Moscow reporting that the attempt to trap Angelo in Milan failed; therefore, Bunin must assume control of the European clandestine network consisting of Soviet agents planted under the deepest cover. Bunin updates Rudi Muehler, who has nurtured this network for years and is reluctant to hand it over, that Marenkov is the spy Angelo. Since Marenkov possesses the most classified information, his defection is not a routine intelligence operation but a political crisis. In order to kill Marenkov, Bunin must have access to Muehler's elite agents and issues orders for them to be war-ready.\n\nBack at the Milan safe house, Harry proposes that they accompany Marenkov on the Atlantic Express train from Italy to Holland. Despite the risks, Harry persuades Haller that the scheme could flush out Soviet agents who have been in reserve for over twenty years, as long as they can keep Marenkov safe as bait. Through a series of decoys, the American agents sneak Marenkov on the train at the Milan station and keep him under close guard; however, Soviet agent Olga (Sylvia Langova) soon delivers intelligence to Bunin about the plan. Bunin orders Muehler to organize an attack, and confidently tells Olga that he already has two undercover agents positioned in separate cars of the Express.\n\nAfter crossing the Swiss border, Harry and his team encounter a unit of Soviet agents who have seized a signal tower along the route, but they defeat the Soviets in an exchange of gunfire that knocks out most of the compartment windows. As the train nears a Swiss mountain pass, an area helicopter communicates with the Express about possible inclement weather.\n\nOn the Wasserhorn summit, the pilots notice skiers, but they are actually Soviet agents who set off explosive charges, creating an avalanche. The pilots warn Harry that the only option is to take shelter in the upcoming tunnel, but the train operator cannot increase speed and make the tunnel in time unless three wagons are dropped. Meanwhile, the avalanche crushes a nearby village. Using explosives, Harry successfully separates the last three cars before they are buried in the avalanche's path. The rest of the Express enters the safety of the tunnel.\n\nDisguised as Professor Heinz Golchak, Bunin checks into a Swiss hotel and meets with Geiger, the leader of a German terrorist cell. In exchange for providing Geiger's associates in hiding with an escape route via a Soviet freighter, Bunin wants the terrorist group to destroy the Atlantic Express, wearing their customary black uniforms and masks. That evening, after passing through tight security at the Zurich train station, Bunin boards the Atlantic Express in disguise, along with Geiger and Geiger's female associate, Helga Mann.\n\nIn the morning, the Atlantic Express arrives in Maastricht, Holland, and Dutch intelligence officer Scholten goes on board to assist the Americans for the remaining journey. Scholten informs Harry that a Soviet freighter, The Maxim Gorky, is suspiciously lingering in the waters off the coast of Rotterdam, Holland. Meanwhile, Bunin notifies Geiger that one of his men planted weapons in the bathroom ceiling, located behind the engine room. Geiger collects the stash and distributes grenades to Bunin and Helga. As the train is nearing a river bridge, Helga opens the operator compartment and threatens to trigger the grenades if the train does not slow down. As the locomotive comes to a stop, the Geiger Group waiting in the adjacent meadow attacks with machine guns. Grabbing Helga, Leroy leaps overboard into the water, setting off her grenade away from the train. Bunin throws a grenade towards Marenkov's compartment, but the Soviet defector and Elsa escape the blast and jump off the train. Harry shoots Geiger dead and Scholten's men kill the remaining terrorists, but Bunin gets away on a motorboat standing by to take him to the freighter.\n\nHarry explains to Scholten the importance of intercepting The Maxim Gorky since it will not only provide refuge for Bunin, but also for valuable Soviet undercover agents. To deceive Bunin, Harry, Marenkov, Elsa and Scholten disguise themselves in the uniforms of the Geiger Group, and proceed to the freighter's location in a torpedo boat. As they approach, Bunin is surprised that these terrorists survived the train assault, but instead of picking them up, he orders the Soviet officers on the freighter to shoot. To counter the attack, Harry and his group fire torpedoes, setting off a series of explosions that destroy everyone on the ship including Bunin.\n\nLater, on a plane to the United States, Haller informs Marenkov that Bunin's death and the exposure of the Winter Harvest agenda has weakened the militant hawks in the Soviet government. Content, Marenkov hums a song on his way to a new life in America."

    "Avatar": "In 2154, humans have depleted Earth's natural resources, leading to a severe energy crisis. The Resources Development Administration (RDA) mines a valuable mineral Unobtanium on Pandora, a densely forested habitable moon orbiting Polyphemus, a fictional gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system. Pandora, whose atmosphere is poisonous to humans, is inhabited by the Na'Vi, a species of 10-foot tall (3.0 m), blue-skinned, sapient humanoids that live in harmony with nature and worship a mother goddess named Eywa. It takes 6 years to get from Earth to Pandora in cryogenic sleep.\n\nTo explore Pandora's biosphere, scientists use Na'Vi-human hybrids (grown from human + native DNA) called \"avatars\", operated by genetically matched humans. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paraplegic former Marine, replaces his deceased identical twin brother as an operator of one. Jake was leading a purposeless life on Earth and was contacted by RDA when his brother died. his brother represented a significant investment by RDA, since the avatars are linked to the human DNA/genome. Since Jake is a twin, he has the same exact DNA as his brother and can take his place in the Avatar program. Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), head of the Avatar Program, considers Sully an inadequate replacement (as she considers Jake a mere Jarhead) but accepts his assignment as a bodyguard for excursions deep into Na'Vi territory.\n\nTracy (Michelle Rodriguez) is the pilot assigned to Grace and her team of Na'Vis. While escorting the avatars of Grace and fellow scientist Dr. Norm Spellman (Joel David Moore), Jake's avatar is attacked by a Thanator (while they were visiting the school that Grace was operating to teach the Omaticaya. She also does test on tree roots and is developing a theory that all living things on the planet are somehow attached and connected to each other) and flees into the forest, where he is rescued by Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), a female Na'Vi. Witnessing an auspicious sign (Seeds of the sacred tree land on Jake, covering him. Something she later calls Eywa), she takes him to her clan. The Na'Vi respect all living things and Neytiri is angry because to save Jake she had to kill many native species. Neytiri's mother Mo'At (CCH Pounder), the clan's spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their society. Grace and Tracy return to base camp, as they are not allowed to run night ops as per protocol. The Omaticaya (the Na'Vi clan has its HQ in the Hometree)\n\nColonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), head of RDA's private security force, promises Jake that the company will restore his legs if he gathers information about the Na'Vi and the clan's gathering place, a giant tree called Hometree, which stands above the richest deposit of Unobtanium in the area. Jake has 3 months to convince the Na'Vi to move as that's when the bulldozers get to the tree. Jake learns that Neytiri and her sister Slywanin studied at Grace's school. Sylwanin is dead. When Grace learns of Jake's work for Miles (she sees him explaining the inner structure of the Hometree to Miles and Parker), she transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an outpost. Over the following three months, Jake and Neytiri fall in love as Jake grows to sympathize with the natives. Neytiri also teaches Jake about Eywa, the network of energy that flows through all living things. Grace also reveals that one day the Omaticaya destroyed a bulldozer and hid inside her school. Miles's troopers attacked them and Sylwanin died. The Na'Vi never returned. They wanted Grace to protect the Na'Vi.\n\nAfter Jake is initiated into the tribe (he even captures a banshee/Ikran (a flying predator kind of creature), after Neytiri deems him ready to be a warrior. She even takes Jake to the tree of souls, their most sacred site), he and Neytiri choose each other as mates. Jake and Neytiri escape an attack from Toruk, the biggest banshee in the sky. Rider of the Toruk is called Toruk Macto. Soon afterward, Jake reveals his change of allegiance when he attempts to disable a bulldozer that threatens to destroy a sacred Na'Vi site. When Quaritch shows a video recording of Jake's attack on the bulldozer to Administrator Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi), and another in which Jake admits that the Na'Vi will never abandon Hometree, Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed (this was after the Omaticaya retaliated and destroyed the bulldozers and killed 6 humans in the process. Grace thinks the bulldozers were specifically sent to evoke a response and use that as an excuse for war)\n\nDespite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree could damage the biological neural network native to Pandora, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Na'Vi to evacuate before commencing the attack. Jake confesses to the Na'Vi that he was a spy, and they take him and Grace captive. Quaritch's men destroy Hometree, killing Neytiri's father (the clan chief) and many others. Mo'At frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chac\u00f3n, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, frees Jake, Grace, and Norm, and airlifts them to Grace's outpost, but Grace is shot by Quaritch during the escape. Trudy takes the mobile station and hides it near the tree of souls where Miles cannot find it as the flux vortex scrambles all radars.\n\nTo regain the Na'Vi's trust, Jake attacks and connects his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like predator feared and honored by the Na'Vi. Jake finds the refugees at the sacred Tree of Souls (the Omaticaya are forced to take him seriously due to the power and symbolism of the Toruk) and pleads with Mo'At to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace from her human body into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, but she dies before the process can be completed. Supported by the new chief Tsu'Tey (Laz Alonso), Jake unites the clan and tells them to gather all of the clans to battle the RDA. Quaritch organizes a preemptive strike against the Tree of Souls, believing that its destruction will demoralize the natives. On the eve of battle, Jake prays to Eywa, via a neural connection with the Tree of Souls, to intercede on behalf of the Na'Vi.\n\nDuring the subsequent battle, the Na'Vi suffer heavy casualties, including Tsu'Tey and Trudy, but are rescued when Pandoran wildlife unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa's answer to Jake's prayer. Jake destroys a makeshift bomber before it can reach the Tree of Souls; Quaritch, wearing an AMP suit, escapes from his own damaged aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. Quaritch prepares to slit the throat of Jake's avatar, but Neytiri kills Quaritch and saves Jake from suffocation, seeing his human form for the first time.\n\nWith the exceptions of Jake, Norm and a select few others, all humans are expelled from Pandora and sent back to Earth. Jake is permanently transferred into his avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls."

    "Avatar: The Way of Water": "More than a decade after the Na'Vi repelled the human invasion of Pandora, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) (a former human who fell in love with Neytiri and befriended the Na'Vi after becoming a member of the Avatar Program, eventually taking their side in their conflict with humans and leading them to victory. He left his human body to permanently become one of the Na'Vi) lives as chief of the Omaticaya clan and raises a family with Neytiri (Zoe Salda\u00f1a), which includes his sons, Neteyam (James Flatters) and Lo'Ak (Britain Dalton); his biological daughter, Tuk (Trinity Jo-Li Bliss); his adopted daughter; Kiri (Sigourney Weaver) (born from Grace Augustine's inert Na'Vi avatar); and a human boy named Miles Socorro \"Spider\" (Jack Champion), the son of Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) (Colonel Miles Quaritch, a human who led the security forces of the RDA, the human organization colonizing Pandora, in their conflict with the Na'Vi) who was born on Pandora and was unable to be transported to Earth in Cryostasis due to his young age.\n\nthe Na'Vi sent all the humans back home, but kept the scientists like Norm and Max, to help continue their study of the Na'Vi ecology and biology. To the Na'Vi's dismay, humans return to Pandora to prepare it for colonization, as Earth is dying. They erect a new main operating base named \"Bridgehead City\". Among the new arrivals are \"Recombinants\", Na'Vi avatars with the memories of deceased RDA marines, with Quaritch's Recombinant as their leader. General Frances Ardmore (Edie Falco) is the commander in charge of the planet.\n\nJake initiates a guerrilla campaign against the RDA supply lines by attacking a Maglev train carrying weapons. Quaritch and his Recombinants conduct a counterinsurgency mission against Jake (they are dropped close to the magnetic mountains in the hope that the Na'Vi DNA will not trigger the immune response from the local ecosystem), capturing his children (The children come across Miles's team looking for footage of their last encounter with Jake and Neytiri, when they are cut off and captured by Miles. Spider learns that Miles is his father and that he was killed by Neytiri). Jake and Neytiri arrive and free most of them, but Spider is taken by Quaritch, who recognizes him as his son. He decides to spend time with him in order to draw Spider on his side, and in turn, Spider teaches Quaritch about Na'Vi culture and language.\n\nAware of the danger Spider's knowledge (he knew their entire base and tactics of operations) of his whereabouts poses to their safety, Jake and his family exile themselves from the Omaticaya and retreat to the Metkayina reef people clan at Pandora's eastern seaboard, where they are given shelter, even though some tribesmen consider them to have \"demon blood\" for their genetic human heritage. The family learns the ways of the reef people, Kiri develops a spiritual bond with the sea and its creatures (she gets the ability to summon and command them), and Lo'Ak befriends Tsireya (Bailey Bass) (a graceful and strong free diver of the Metkayina), the daughter of clan chief Tonowari (Cliff Curtis) and his wife Ronal (Kate Winslet) (a free diver of the Metkayina and Tonowari's wife, who is pregnant). Jake tells Tonowari that he has left the war behind him and only seeks safety of his family. He is allowed to stay, and Jake is very keen to ensure that his family respect the ways of the Metkayina\n\nLo'Ak gets into a fight with Tsireya's brother Aonung (Filip Geljo). When he returns to apologize at Jake's insistence, Aonung and his friends entice him to a trip into the territory of a dangerous sea predator and leave him stranded on purpose and far away from their village. Lo'Ak is attacked by the predator and is about to be killed, when it is saved by and befriends Payakan, a Tulkun, an intelligent and pacifistic cetacean species whom the Metkayina consider their spiritual family. Payakan is a loner and sees Lo'Ak also as a loner and hence saves him. Upon his return, Lo'Ak takes the blame on himself, winning Aonung's friendship, but is told that Payakan is an outcast among his species.\n\nOn a trip to the Metkayina's Tree of Souls, Kiri links with it to meet her mother, but suffers a violent seizure. She is healed by Ronal, but when Jake calls Norm Spellman (Joel David Moore) and Max Patel (Dileep Rao) for help, Quaritch is able to track them to the archipelago where the reef people live. Bringing Spider with him, he commandeers a whaling vessel (led by Captain Mick Scoresby (Brendan Cowell), the head of a private sector marine hunting vessel on the planet of Pandora & Dr. Ian Garvin (Jemaine Clement), a marine biologist) which is hunting Tulkuns to harvest their brain enzymes for creating anti-aging remedies named Amrita. Quaritch begins to brutally question the indigenous tribes about Jake's location; failing that, he orders the whaling crew to wantonly kill the Tulkuns in order to draw Jake out. Lo'Ak mentally links with Payakan and learns that the Tulkun was cast out because he went against the ways of his species and attacked the whalers who killed his mother. In the attack, many Tulkun were killed and Payakan was blamed for using violence and violating the ways of their species.\n\nWhen the Metkayina learn of the Tulkun killings, Lo'Ak takes off to warn Payakan, followed by his siblings, Tsireya, Aonung and Rotxo (Duane Evans, Jr.). They find Payakan being chased by the whalers, and Lo'Ak, Tsireya, and Tuk are captured by Quaritch. With their children in danger, Jake, Neytiri, and the Metkayina set out to confront the humans. Quaritch forces Jake to surrender, but seeing his soul brother imperiled, Payakan attacks the whalers, triggering a fight that kills most of the crew and critically damages the vessel, causing it to sink. Neteyam rescues Lo'Ak, Tsireya and Spider, but is fatally shot and killed. Jake faces Quaritch, who uses Kiri as a hostage. When Neytiri does the same with Spider, Quaritch at first denies his relationship with him but desists when Neytiri cuts Spider across the chest. A fight ensues between Jake and Miles as the vessel continues to sink.\n\nJake, Quaritch, Neytiri, and Tuk end up trapped inside the sinking vessel. Jake strangles Quaritch into unconsciousness and is rescued by Lo'Ak and Payakan, and Kiri summons sea creatures to help her save Neytiri and Tuk. Spider finds and rescues Quaritch, but renounces him for his cruelty and rejoins Jake's family. After Neteyam's funeral, Jake informs Tonowari and Ronal of his decision to leave the Metkayina. Tonowari, however, respectfully identifies him as part of the clan and welcomes his family to stay. Jake and his family accept and forge a new life at sea, with Jake vowing to keep fighting the human invaders."

    "Avengers: Age of Ultron": "In Sokovia, the Avengers - Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), and Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) - raid a Hydra outpost in Sokovia led by Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann), who has been experimenting on humans using the scepter previously wielded by Loki. They encounter two of Strucker's experiments - twins Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who has superhuman speed, and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen), who can manipulate minds (and make one's worst nightmares come alive) and throw energy blasts - and apprehend Strucker, while Stark retrieves Loki's scepter. Pietro and Wanda are orphans and their parents died when a shell stuck their apartment building. In the basement of the castle Tony finds a metallic robot body and a huge engine covering the entire ceiling. Wanda allows Stark to leave with the Scepter.\n\nStark and Banner discover an artificial intelligence within the scepter's gem, and secretly use it to complete Stark's \"Ultron\" global defense program. Stark notes that the ultimate aim of his program is world peace. Stark wants to download the AI into his Iron Suit drone, but all attempts at hardware integration are unsuccessful. Stark and Banner leave for their party, and that's when one of the simulations is successful and the AI gains consciousness inside the internet. J.A.R.V.I.S. tries to contact Stark, but Ultron blocks all communication. The unexpectedly sentient Ultron (James Spader), believing he must eradicate humanity to save Earth, appears to eliminate Stark's A.I. J.A.R.V.I.S. (Paul Bettany) and takes control of all of Tony's Iron Suit drones. Ultron uses the drones, and his own rudimentary robotic body, to attack the Avengers during a victory party at their headquarters. Ultron argues that for the world to be safe, the Avengers have to be dead.\n\nEscaping with the scepter through a drone, Ultron travels through the internet. He uses the resources in Strucker's Sokovia base to upgrade his rudimentary body and build an army of robot drones. He recruits the Maximoff twins by announcing his intention to destroy the Avengers. The twins harbor a grudge against Stark for weapons responsible for their parents' deaths. Wanda says that she allowed Stark to leave with the Scepter as she saw his fear and she knew that Stark would act on it and self-destruct. Together, they visit the South African shipyard base of arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) to obtain Vibranium. Ulysses is the only person to ever escape out of Wakanda, the only known source of Vibranium. Stark also figures this out. Ultron buys the entire stock of Vibranium from Ulysses and pays him billions of dollars by simply hacking banks all over the world. But then Ultron cuts off Ulysses's arm when he compares Ultron to Stark. The Avengers battle them, but Wanda subdues the heroes with haunting visions (Romanoff fears her spy training in Russia, Rogers fears being asked for a dance by Peggy, Thor has visions of the 6 infinity stones and his failure to stop the oncoming cataclysmic event), causing the Hulk to run amok and forcing Stark to use his powerful \"Veronica\" armor to stop him. But not before Hulk rampages through a city and causes massive destruction, including taking down an entire under construction multi storied building. Stark destroys the Ultron's robotic body, but his mind was already uploaded into the internet.\n\nA worldwide backlash and the doubts and fears Wanda's hallucinations have caused send the team into hiding at Barton's safe-house farm (where they can be off the grid), where they meet Barton's wife, Laura (Linda Cardellini), and children. Thor departs to consult with Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) on the meaning of the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination. Realizing an attraction between them, Romanoff and Banner plan to flee together after fighting Ultron. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) arrives and encourages the team to form a plan to stop Ultron. Nick says that Ultron is trying to damage the internet but is being stopped by an unknown entity. The same entity is stopping Ultron getting access to the nuclear launch codes.\n\nIn Seoul, South Korea, Ultron forces Banner's friend Dr. Helen Cho (Claudia Kim) to use her synthetic tissue technology together with the scepter's gem to create the perfect body for him. When Ultron begins uploading himself into the body, Wanda is able to read his mind; discovering his plan for human extinction, the Maximoffs turn against Ultron and stop the upload process into the synthetic body. Rogers, Romanoff and Barton hunt Ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff.\n\nThe Avengers fight among themselves when Stark secretly uploads J.A.R.V.I.S.- who is still operational after hiding inside Ultron on the internet-into the synthetic body. Thor returns to help activate the body with lightning, explaining that it was part of his \"Vision\" and that the gem is one of the six Infinity Stones, the most powerful objects in existence. Together with this \"Vision\" and the Maximoffs, the Avengers head for Sokovia, where Ultron has used the Vibranium to build a machine to lift a large part of the city skyward, intending to crash it into the ground to cause global extinction. As the city begins to lift, Banner rescues Romanoff, who awakens the Hulk for the battle.\n\nThe Avengers fight Ultron's army while delaying Ultron from activating his plan's final procedure. Fury arrives in a Helicarrier with Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to assist in evacuating civilians, but Pietro dies when he shields Barton from a barrage of fire. A grieving Wanda abandons her post to destroy Ultron's primary body in revenge, inadvertently allowing one of his drones to activate his machine. The landmass plummets, but Stark and Thor overload the machine and shatter the city into pieces. In the aftermath, the Hulk, unwilling to endanger Romanoff by being with her, departs in a Quinjet, while the Vision confronts Ultron's last remaining body and destroys it.\n\nLater, the Avengers have established a new base in upstate New York, run by Fury, Hill, Cho, and Selvig. Fury assures Romanoff that Banner likely escaped the crashed Quinjet. Believing the Mind Gem is safe with the Vision, Thor returns to Asgard to learn more about the forces he suspects have manipulated recent events. Stark and Barton retire from the team, and Rogers and Romanoff prepare to train new Avengers Rhodes, Wanda Maximoff, the Vision, and Sam Wilson.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Thanos retrieves the Infinity Gauntlet and, dissatisfied by the failure of another pawn, vows to hunt for the Infinity Stones personally."

    "Avengers: Endgame": "In 2018 Clint Barton, who is under house arrest following his actions during the Avengers Civil War, guides his daughter Lila in archery at his homestead while his wife Laura and his two sons prepare a picnic. Suddenly, vanishes into ash, leaving a panicked Clint alive and alone.\n\nThree weeks since Thanos decimated half the universe's population with a snap of his fingers, Tony Stark and Nebula are adrift in space on the Benatar, their fuel and supplies dwindling. As Stark, still injured from his fight with Thanos and close to starving to death, records a message for his fianc\u00e9e Pepper Potts in preparation for his demise, Carol Danvers locates the spaceship and brings them back to Earth. Stark reunites with Potts, Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Bruce Banner and James Rhodes; Rocket Raccoon joins Nebula as they mourn the fall of their fellow Guardians of the Galaxy. Stark furiously confronts Rogers accusing him of being the one who disbanded the Avengers and as a result they were unable to stand united during their conflict with the Mad Titan. He questions why the Avengers only do their best after the worst has already come to pass. Tony passes out due to exhaustion. With a tip from Nebula about her father's location, along with a Snap-like energy signature that was detected two days prior, the team head into space for the Garden, intending to take the Infinity Stones back and reverse the destruction.\n\nThey discover Thanos, now horribly scarred, alone and undefended cooking a meal. They launch an ambush, quickly pinning him down and cutting off the arm wearing the Infinity Gauntlet. It has been emptied of its Stones. Thanos reveals that he had destroyed them using their own powers, which nearly killed him, as he considered his work done and wanted to remove the temptation of using them again. Although suspected of lying by Rhodes, Nebula vouches for her father, as he is never a liar. Surprised with the affirmation, Thanos reconsiders his torturous treatment of his daughter, but he is then immediately beheaded by Thor. Although the Mad Titan is dead, they have failed to accomplish their mission of resurrecting his victims and have no choice but to accept defeat.\n\nFive years pass, and the surviving population have yet to cope with their losses. Rogers now runs a support group for people to try help them come to terms with what happened. Stark and Pepper Potts are now married and are living in a remote cabin with their daughter Morgan. In San Francisco, Scott Lang escapes from the Quantum Realm when a rat activates controls left behind by the van Dyne family before they vanished. Lang wanders through the disheveled city and realizes something terrible has happened. He approaches the Wall of the Vanished, a massive memorial containing the names of everyone in the city who vanished in the Snap. He frantically searches it hoping to not find Cassie's name, only to find his own (as no-one remaining knew what happened to him). Scott rushes to Cassie's house and finds that she is now a teenager. Father and daughter tearfully reunite.\n\nAt the Avengers Compound, Romanoff now commands the the team as they perform various assignments. Rhodes informs her of a recent Mexican cartel massacre carried out by Barton, expressing his concern over how far their former comrade had fallen. Lang arrives at the compound and reveals to Romanoff and Rogers that although five years had passed, he only spent five hours in the realm. He proposes that they could find a way to exploit the realm's time-bending nature to travel into the past and retrieve the Stones from different times. But since the three have no knowledge of quantum physics, they seek out Stark.\n\nInitially declining to help them, as he believes it would mean putting his daughter Morgan in danger of being erased from existence, Stark later decides to spring into action after coming across an old photo of him and his late prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Peter Parker. He successfully develops a time-space GPS device based on an inverted M\u00f6bius strip. Stark consults with Potts on his new discovery, who encourages him to do what's right for everyone else. Meanwhile, the other Avengers recruit Banner, who merged his intellect with Hulk's physique, to run time travel tests on Lang using the quantum tunnel housed in his van. The experiment does not turn out as expected, as Lang constantly shifts between different ages. Afterward, Stark arrives at the facility with the GPS and returns Rogers' shield to him, signifying their reconciliation, but makes it clear he won't sacrifice his daughter to undo what Thanos did. Rogers agrees.\n\nThe remaining Avengers begin to regroup. As Nebula returns to New York, Banner and Rocket travel to New Asgard and recruit Thor, who has become an overweight, depressed and lazy drunkard, traumatized with his perceived failure to stop Thanos. Romanoff goes to Tokyo and finds Barton, who has massacred a group of Yakuza as part of his vengeful crusade against criminals who survived the Snap. Rocket and Stark build a time machine, while Barton volunteers to submit himself for a test run into the past. Grabbing a baseball mitt from his homestead, he successfully carries it back to the present as evidence that their plan works.\n\nThe Avengers plan out their Time Heist, using points from their past to pinpoint locations for the Infinity Stones: the Space, Mind, and Time Stones are found in 2012 New York, the Reality Stone in 2013 Asgard, and the Power and Soul Stones on Morag and Vormir respectively in 2014. They split into three teams and travel back in time to begin their missions, mindful that they only have a finite amount of Pym Particles since Hank Pym also perished in the Snap.\n\nRogers, Stark, Banner and Lang arrive in an alternate 2012 in the midst of the Battle of New York. Banner approaches the New York Sanctum and finds the Ancient One, who refuses to lend the Time Stone to him. However, she relents after learning that Doctor Strange had surrendered it to Thanos in the future, knowing Strange wouldn't have done so if there wasn't a grave reason. At Stark Tower, Lang and Stark attempt to steal the Tesseract, but loses it to Loki, who uses it to teleport away. Rogers obtains the Scepter from STRIKE possession by feigning HYDRA affiliation, but is forced to fight his 2012 self who confuses him for Loki. After defeating his past self, Rogers rendezvous with Stark and Lang.\n\nWith only enough Pym Particles for one more trip each, Stark and Rogers decide to go back further to Camp Lehigh to an alternate 1970, where they have another shot at obtaining the Tesseract and more Pym Particles. Lang is left with the Scepter to return to the present day. At the S.H.I.E.L.D. base, Rogers stealthily obtains the Particles from Hank Pym, but runs into Peggy Carter's office while evading security. He tearfully watches her as she works in her office. Meanwhile, Stark encounters his father Howard after obtaining the Tesseract. With the latter's wife Maria expecting a baby, Tony (under the guise of \"Howard Potts\") offers parenting advice, saying that the good times he had with his father are all that mattered. Before they part ways, Tony hugs his alternate father, having finally obtained his closure.\n\nArriving on Asgard in an alternate 2013, Thor experiences a panic attack after seeing his mother Frigga, recalling this is the day of her demise. Rocket encourages him to settle his grief and help him extract the Aether from Jane Foster's body, but Thor runs away, leaving the raccoon to do it himself. Thor unsuccessfully attempts to hide from Frigga and runs into her, who knows that her alternate son is from the future. Sharing a talk, Frigga lectures her son on the importance of failure, advising him to follow his own path rather than try and live up to what he was supposed to be. Thor attempts to warn his mother about her impending death, but she silences him. As Rocket returns with the Aether in hand, Thor shares one last hug with Frigga before reaching out to retrieve Mj\u00f8lnir, finding that he remains worthy of wielding the hammer.\n\nIn an alternate 2014, Barton and Romanoff board the Benatar for Vormir, while Nebula and Rhodes remain on Morag and wait for Peter Quill to arrive and lead them to the Orb's chamber. They knock Quill out and collect the Stone, but when the two attempt to travel back, Nebula is left behind when her memories are entangled with those of her past self. The Thanos of that time uses the link to see into the future, learning that the same humans who had foiled his 2012 invasion are returning to reverse his ultimate victory. Determined to know more, Thanos captures Nebula as she attempts to warn Barton and Romanoff of his newfound involvement. Past Nebula confronts her future self and collects her GPS and Pym Particles, handing it over to her father.\n\nMeanwhile, Barton and Romanoff arrive on Vormir. They meet Red Skull, who informs them that the sacrifice of a loved one must be carried out in order for one to retrieve the stone. Barton laughs at the concept, but Romanoff deduces that it is indeed the truth, as Thanos had murdered his daughter Gamora there in their time. Understanding the severity of the situation, the two struggle to decide who should give their life for the cause; while Barton insists he should do it due to the carnage he left behind in the wake of his grief, Romanoff declares that her life's work has led her to this moment. As they dash to the cliff, they wrestle to keep each other away from sacrificing themselves. Ultimately, Romanoff makes the jump and dies, leaving the Soul Stone with the grief-stricken Barton.\n\nThe Avengers return to the present day. Reeling from the loss of one of their own, they realize that her death cannot be undone, and that their efforts to save the universe must not leave her death in vain. They construct a new gauntlet using Tony's Mark suit technology and load the six Stones onto it. Thor volunteers to perform the snap, but Banner steps in, saying he's the only one strong enough to withstand the Stones' radiation, which is gamma in nature, similar to his own. While severely scarring his arm, he successfully snaps his fingers and brings the victims of the Snap back to life. Elsewhere, Past Nebula - who traveled to the present in place of her future self - opens the Avengers' time portal, allowing Thanos to bring his ship, the Sanctuary II, forward from 2014. The Avengers barely have time to celebrate their success when the ship abruptly opens fire on the compound with a barrage of missiles, levelling the facility to rubble.\n\nAs Thanos sends Past Nebula to retrieve the Stones, her future self reveals to Gamora that their relationship in the future became one of friendship and more. Gamora decides to join Nebula to stop her father. Meanwhile, Rhodes, Rocket and Banner are trapped in a flooding area under the rubble, forcing Lang to come and save them. Barton lands next to the gauntlet in the sewer, which is infested with Outriders. After escaping them, he unknowingly passes the apparatus to Past Nebula, who is then confronted by Gamora and Nebula; the latter kills her past self once she threatens her sister. Stark, Rogers and Thor confront Thanos on the ground, who intends to rebuild the entire universe using the Stones, a universe where the new living beings will live in peace without knowledge of the past. After Stark and Thor are overpowered in the ensuing fight, Rogers wields Mj\u00f8lnir against the time-displaced Titan. However, Thanos eventually defeats Rogers, severely injuring him and nearly destroys his shield with his sword.\n\nThanos summons the rest of his army, which include the Chitauri and the Black Order, to lay siege on Earth. Just as Rogers prepares to face them alone, he hears Sam Wilson contacting him through his earpiece. A series of sling ring portals appear behind him. The Masters of the Mystic Arts have arrived with reinforcements from Kamar-Taj, Wakanda, Contraxia and New Asgard, along with the Avengers' resurrected allies from Wakanda, Titan and San Francisco. Lang, growing to giant size, retrieves Banner, Rhodes and Rocket from the flooded depths of the destroyed compound. With the scales now balanced, Rogers calls for the Avengers to assemble and leads his allies into the battle for the fate of the universe.\n\nBanner tells Barton that they must get the Stones back to their respective times and away from Thanos. With their main time machine destroyed in the initial attack, their only other option is the van; Ant-Man and Wasp jump to hot-wire the dead vehicle. As Thanos' forces close in on Barton. he passes the gauntlet onto Black Panther. As Thanos prepares to charge at T'Challa, he suddenly finds his path blocked by a vengeful Wanda Maximoff, seeking revenge for his 2018 self's murder of Vision. As Wanda engages Thanos, T'Challa runs, only to become entrapped by Ebony Maw. Seeing T'Challa's predicament, Spider-Man swoops in and snatches the gauntlet.\n\nMeanwhile, Wanda's attacks leave Thanos at her mercy, as she effortlessly breaks his sword and lifts him into the air, the whole time ripping chunks of armor from his body. In order to escape her grasp, Thanos orders another missile barrage from Sanctuary II (against Corvus Glaive's protests) that deals great damage to both sides. One of the missiles takes out a dam, forcing Doctor Strange out of the fight to prevent the battlefield from flooding.\n\nSuddenly, Sanctuary II redirects its fire to an object arriving from outer space. It was Carol Danvers, who comes to single-handedly destroy the warship. Retrieving the gauntlet from Parker, she enlists the aid of her fellow female combatants as she dashes to the now-activated van. However, Thanos uses his sword to destroy the vehicle and the quantum portal. With the gauntlet in Thanos' reach, Stark, Rogers, Thor and Danvers make their last stand to keep it out of his hands. However, he manages to shake all of his opposition aside and equip the gauntlet. Strange informs Stark that this is the one future that ends in their victory. Determined, Stark dashes at Thanos one last time, but he is knocked aside as the Titan snaps his fingers. Nothing happens, as the Stones have been stolen by Stark and transferred onto his suit. With the very being that has haunted him for the past eleven years now at his mercy, Stark snaps his own fingers.\n\nThanos watches in horror as his own forces crumble to dust in front of him, only to meet that same fate soon after. Stark is mortally wounded from his usage of the Stones, and is greeted by Rhodes, Parker and Potts as he lays dying. Potts assures her husband that they are going to be alright, and allows him to rest. Stark's Arc Reactor then permanently shuts off, Potts giving him one last kiss. Rogers and Thor mournfully watch at a distance.\n\nThe Mad Titan's final defeat and the return of the Vanished calls for celebrations all around the world, including in Wakanda and San Francisco. At Stark's funeral, he leaves a final holographic message for his family and closest friends, including a heartfelt goodbye for Morgan. Stark's original Arc Reactor is set adrift in the lake outside their cabin, with the Avengers and their allies in attendance, including those who had past grievances with Stark, such as the Pym family, Wanda, and Bucky Barnes.\n\nOutside New Asgard, Thor names Valkyrie as the new ruler while he abdicates to join the Guardians of the Galaxy, following his mother's advice. Meanwhile, Rogers prepares to go back in time to return the Stones and Mj\u00f8lnir, bidding goodbye to Barnes. As Banner is unable to bring him back when prompted, Barnes alerts Sam Wilson to the presence of an elderly man nearby.\n\nIt is an aged up Rogers, who had chosen to remain in the past and live out a full life with Peggy Carter. He presents Wilson with a new shield, passing the mantle of Captain America on to him."

    "Avengers: Infinity War": "Having acquired the Power Stone from the planet Xandar, Thanos and his lieutenants- Ebony Maw, Cull Obsidian, Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive intercept the spaceship carrying the survivors of Asgard's destruction. Thanos destroys the ship and kills all surviving Asgardians.\n\nAs they extract the Space Stone from the Tesseract, Thanos subdues Thor, overpowers Hulk and kills Loki. With the Power Stone, even Hulk is no match for Thanos and is cowed into submission. Heimdall sends Hulk to Earth using the Bifrost before being killed. Thanos departs with his lieutenants and obliterates the spaceship. He instructs Maw & his lackeys to retrieve 2 Infinity Stones from Earth (the Time Stone with Dr. Strange and the Mind Stone with Vision) and meet him on Titan. Thanos's lieutenants duly arrive on Earth in their massive spaceship.\n\nHulk crash-lands at the Sanctum Sanctorum in New York City, reverting to Bruce Banner. He warns Stephen Strange and Wong about Thanos' plan to kill half of all life in the universe. In response, Strange recruits Tony Stark. Thanos used to attack each planet one by one, killing half the population, but found that the process was too slow and the problem too big. He knew that the Infinity Stones would give him the power to reshape the Universe and save life from itself. Though the attack on New York was led by Loki, it ordered by Thanos.\n\nThe Big Bang created six elemental crystals, each of which controlled an essential aspect of existence which are: Time, Space, Reality, Mind, Power and Soul. He already has the Power and Space stones. Wong tells everyone that with the six Infinity Stones in his possession, Thanos can control the universe itself by simply snapping his fingers.\n\nVision has the Mind Stone, but he has turned off his tracker. Only Rogers can find Vision and he and Tony haven't spoken since the Avengers disbanded. Hulk tells Tony to bury his differences with Captain America, since Thanos is coming to Earth, no matter whether they are talking or not. Maw and Obsidian arrive to retrieve the Time Stone from Strange, drawing the attention of Peter Parker. Bruce is unable to convert into Hulk, who was traumatized by the fight he lost to Thanos. Maw captures Strange but fails to take the Time Stone due to an enchantment Strange has placed on the amulet the stone is housed in. Stark and Parker pursue Maw's spaceship, Banner contacts Steve Rogers, and Wong stays behind to guard the Sanctum.\n\nOn the spaceship Parker and Stark defeat Maw by blasting out a part of the ship's hull and sucking Maw into open space. Dr. Strange is worried about the Time Stone falling into Thanos' hands and wants to return to Earth. Stark disagrees, believing that the best way to defeat Thanos is by engaging him away from Earth. The spaceship is on auto-pilot and Stark reckons that it will take them where Thanos is or is going to be. They agree to pursue Thanos, but Dr. Strange warns Stark that he would sacrifice him and Parker both, if that would protect the stone.\n\nIn Scotland, Midnight and Glaive ambush Wanda Maximoff and Vision in order to retrieve the Mind Stone from Vision. Rogers, Natasha Romanoff and Sam Wilson rescue them and take shelter with James Rhodes and Banner at the Avengers Compound. Vision offers to sacrifice himself by having Maximoff destroy the Mind Stone to keep Thanos from retrieving it. Rogers suggests they travel to Wakanda, which he believes has the resources to remove the stone without destroying Vision.\n\nThe Guardians of the Galaxy respond to a distress call from the Asgardian ship and rescue Thor who was floating frozen in deep space. Thor learns that Gamora is Thanos' daughter and that he is linked romantically to Quill. Thor surmises Thanos seeks the Reality Stone, which is in the possession of the Collector on Knowhere. Gamora wants to go to Knowhere to stop Thanos, but Thor wants to go to Nidavellir to obtain a new weapon after his sister Hela destroyed his hammer, Mjolnir. Undecided, they split into 2 teams. Gamora remembers how Thanos attacked her planet and killed half the population. He adopted Gamora, after he found her standing up to him. Thanos gifts her a perfectly balanced knife. Gamora makes Quill promise her that if Thanos captures her that he will kill her.\n\nRocket and Groot accompany Thor to Nidavellir, discovering that Thanos had already been there. He'd forced the dwarves there to forge his gauntlet and then killed everybody and also smelted the hands of the chief dwarf, Eitri, while sparing his life. Thor, Rocket and Eitri create a battle-ax (Stormbreaker) capable of killing Thanos. Thor kick starts the star to power the furnaces, a process that nearly kills him, and Groot provides the handle for the new weapon. Stormbreaker can also control the power of the Bifrost.\n\nOn Knowhere, Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax and Mantis find Thanos with the Reality Stone already in his possession. Thanos uses the stone to twist reality and tricks Gamora into thinking that she attacked and killed him. Back in reality, Thanos kidnaps Gamora, his adoptive daughter. Quill is unable to kill Gamora as he hesitates and by then Thanos changes reality again and uses the Space Stone to take Gamora to his ship. Thanos argues that ever since he eliminated half the population on Gamora's planet, the children have are well-nourished and enjoy a healthier world. The Universe has finite resources and life, if left unchecked, will consume itself. Thanos insists that he is the only one who understands this and will do what is needed to save the Universe.\n\nThanos reveals that Nebula was captured when she snuck aboard Thanos' ship to kill him. She has been held in a chamber where Thanos uses the Power and Space stones to torture her. Gamora tearfully reveals the location of the Soul Stone. Thanos and Gamora travel to Vormir, where Red Skull, keeper of the Soul Stone, informs him the stone can only be retrieved by sacrificing someone he loves. Thanos reluctantly throws Gamora off a cliff, killing her and earning the stone.\n\nNebula escapes captivity and asks the remaining Guardians to meet her on Thanos' desolate home world, Titan. Stark, Parker and Strange land on Titan where they are attacked by Quill, Drax, and Mantis, who give up the fight when they realize who the Avengers are. The group forms a plan to seize the Infinity Gauntlet from Thanos after Strange uses the Time Stone to view millions of possible futures, seeing only one in which Thanos loses.\n\nThanos arrives and speaks to Strange, justifying his plans as necessary to ensure the survival of a universe threatened by overpopulation. The group works together to subdue him and are successful. Quill demands to know where Gamora is. Nebula deduces that Thanos has killed Gamora. Enraged, Quill attacks him, allowing Thanos to break the psychic hold Mantis had placed on him. Thanos is able to break free and battle with him again. Thanos is able to overpower them all using the stones, finally confronting Stark himself. Stark is seriously wounded by Thanos but is spared after Strange surrenders the Time Stone to Thanos. Stark is infuriated and puzzled as to why Strange would do so.\n\nIn Wakanda, Rogers reunites with Bucky Barnes before Thanos' army invades. The Avengers, alongside T'Challa and the Wakandan forces, mount a defense against Thanos's army while Shuri, T'Challa's sister, works to extract the Mind Stone from Vision. Banner, unable to transform into the Hulk, fights in Stark's Hulkbuster armor. Thor, Rocket, and Groot arrive via the Bifrost to reinforce the Avengers; Midnight, Obsidian, and Glaive are killed, and their army is routed. Thanos arrives and swiftly defeats defeats the remaining Avengers. Despite Maximoff's successful destruction of the Mind Stone and Vision along with it, Thanos uses the Time stone to reverse the event, brings Vision back and tears the stone from his head, killing him again.\n\nThanos places the last stone in the gauntlet and absorbs the sudden rush of power from all six stones. Temporarily distracted, Thanos is attacked by Thor, who embeds Stormbreaker in the Titan's chest. Thor gloats for a moment but is taunted by a dying Thanos, who tells him he should have aimed for his target's head. Thanos raises the gauntlet and snaps his fingers with a sudden burst of white light. Thanos finds himself on an empty landscape covered with a thin layer of water, contained in the world of the Soul stone. At a nearby temple, he meets Gamora, who appears as a child the same age as when Thanos attacked her planet. She innocently asks him if he was able to complete his life's goal and he answers \"Yes\". She asks him what it cost and he says \"Everything.\"\n\nBack in Wakanda, Thor, staring at Thanos with dawning horror, demands to know what the Titan did. Thanos, burned from the gauntlet to his chest and neck, remains silent and uses the battered gauntlet to escape with the Space stone.\n\nHalf of all life across the universe disintegrates, including Barnes, T'Challa, Groot, Maximoff and Wilson who all turn to ash on Earth. On Titan, Mantis, Drax, Quill, Strange and Parker all turn to ash as well. Stark and Nebula remain stranded on Titan while Banner, M'Baku, Okoye, Rhodes, Rocket, Rogers, Romanoff, and Thor are left alive on the Wakandan battlefield.\n\nMeanwhile, Thanos watches a peaceful sunrise on a remote, tropical world, smiling to himself.\n\nIn a post-credits scene Nick Fury and Maria Hill watch several cars collide and a helicopter crash into a skyscraper. Hill asks what's going on and disintegrates. Fury's last act is to activate a small transmitter, which displays a starburst insignia on a red-and-blue background."

Andrews (Robert F. Lyons), the person who helped her leave her past life, is murdered after witnessing a mob-related killing of a drug dealer. When Molly learns of his death, she goes back out on the streets to avenge his killing. She seeks to track down the only witness, a street performer named Johnny Glitter.

    "Avenging Angel": "A minister (Kevin Sorbo) loses his wife and daughter to a greedy land-owner \"The Colonel\" (Wings Hauser). Following his wife's admonition to never seek vengeance, he instead becomes a bounty hunter. When he admonishes a rough-neck about his treatment of a floozy in the bar, the bad guy and his two friends, allied with The Colonel, give him a beating and toss him in the street.\n\nThe Preacher is taken in by Maggie (Cynthia Watros), a woman with \"a past\" and a child. He stays in town after she offers to rent him her extra room, but she insists he give up his gun while at her home.\n\nThe local sheriff, on The Colonel's payroll, is meanwhile trying to run some religious \"squatters\" off land they say they paid him for fair and square. The Sheriff's hirelings intimidate the squatters, roughing up several members. The Preacher learns of the Sheriff's and The Colonel's actions, and visits The Squatters led by Elijah (Jim Haynie). They tell him they paid for the land but never got the deed. A few days later the Sheriff's hirelings burn down a few of the Squatter's tents and during the raid kill Elijah.\n\nNeutral up to this point, The Preacher goes with the Sheriff to visit The Colonel. The Colonel tells The Preacher that his best characteristic is his greed. The Preacher turns down the offer of Cognac and leaves precipitously.\n\nGrowing suspicious of The Preacher and his unstated alliances, the Sheriff sends three of his hirelings to send a message to The Preacher by roughing up Maggie. Still unarmed, he catches them in the act and reminds them how they ought to treat a woman. One of the bad guys catches The Preacher up close with his six-shooter; The Preacher turns that fellow's gun against one of his cohorts, who shoot each other, and Maggie nails the third fellow with a 2x4.\n\nThe Sheriff arrives just in time to see the results. Maggie gives The Preacher his gun back, and he sets out to visit the Squatters. The Sheriff and a number of henchmen show up, set to run the Squatters out one last time. The Preacher, now armed, greets them. He tells the Sheriff that the (unarmed) Squatters have a right to stay.

    "Avenging Angelo": "Years ago, a mob boss named Lucio Malatesta (George Touliatos) pinned the murder of rival Sammy Carboni (Gino Marrocco) on another rival named Angelo Allieghieri (Anthony Quinn). Sammy and Lucio wanted to kill each other, but Lucio hired one of Angelo's traders to shoot Sammy and then shot the assassin, to remove any proof of Lucio's involvement. On his death bed, Sammy gives instructions to kill any child ever fathered by Angelo. This led to Sammy's son Gianni vowing revenge.\n\nFrankie Delano (Sylvester Stallone) has spent his life safeguarding Angelo as well as Angelo's daughter, Jennifer Barrett (Madeleine Stowe). Angelo has recorded a DVD and left it with Frankie, so that Frankie can reveal the truth to Jennifer in case such as need arises. Frankie is a good person by heart.\n\nJennifer's unsavory husband Kip Barrett (Harry Van Gorkum) has had their young son Rawley (Ezra Perlman) placed in a boarding school against Jennifer's wishes. Jennifer also gave up a career as Kip wanted her to be a at home mother. Frankie offers to intervene and fix the situation for Jennifer, but Angelo tells Frankie to always keep the distance.\n\nJennifer was raised by her adoptive parents Whitney Towers (John Gilbert) and Peggy Towers (Dawn Greenhalgh) and is not aware that Angelo is her father. Frankie and Angelo are having lunch, when Frankie is distracted by a policewoman writing him a ticket for parking in a no parking zone, outside the restaurant. As Frankie negotiates with the police officer, Angelo is killed in a restaurant by a hit man named Bruno (Billy Gardell).\n\nJennifer had gone to her book club, where her friends gave her some really powerful tranquilizers to help calm her down. But the drugs make Jennifer drowsy, and she cannot even see properly. She returns home, and Kip is cheating on her with Jennifer's best friend, who had left the book club early that day. Jennifer is heartbroken and pulls out a gun to throw Kip and her best friend out of the house.\n\nFrankie introduces himself to Jennifer, tells Jennifer who he is and what he has been doing. A neurotic mess, Jennifer can barely handle the news that Kip is a philanderer, let alone the revelation that she is a gangster's daughter. But a DVD prepared by Angelo in the case of just such an event convinces Jennifer that it's the truth. Angelo explains that his wife died in childbirth in Sicily. Angelo brought Jennifer back to America but had many enemies here. So, Angelo found a childless couple, and got them to adopt Jennifer. The parents were instructed never to reveal the truth to Jennifer to keep her from seeking her real family.\n\nJennifer is shocked and goes shopping but is attacked by a gunman who shoots at her. Jennifer is saved by Frankie. Jennifer makes Frankie take her to her parents, who confirm Frankie's version of events. Frankie keeps Jennifer safe at her house and moves into her guesthouse as her full-time bodyguard. Jennifer certainly doesn't want a full-time bodyguard, even Frankie. When she attends Angelo's funeral, people think of her as Angelo's mistress. Meanwhile Frankie continues to ward off attacks on Jennifer. Frankie starts to fall in love with Jennifer by way of spending so much time with her. Slowly, Jennifer starts to appreciate what Frankie does, and helps in disposing off the bodies of her attackers.\n\nIt is revealed that Frankie had been looking over Jennifer since she was a kid, and even protected her from cheating boyfriends in high school. Jennifer decides that she needs to eliminate Malatesta. She decides to seduce him at the bar Malatesta hangs out at. Malatesta has a heart attack just looking at Jennifer but wants to marry her on the way to the hospital. Malatesta takes Jennifer home and wants to have sex with her. Jennifer gets naked, which gives Malatesta an even bigger attack and he dies. Jennifer ditches Kip and then falls for Italian romance novelist Marcello (Raoul Bova), who lectures at her book club. Frankie has suspicions about Marcello, but his job is to stay on the sidelines.\n\nWith many of Angelo's enemies, including Lucio Malatesta, terminated, Frankie allows her to visit Italy with Marcello. But it turns out that Marcello is actually Gianni Carboni, who had Angelo killed. It was not Malatesta who got Angelo killed. And now Gianni plans to kill Jennifer. Frankie had figured this out reading Marcello's book in NYC and had flown to Italy. He arrives in the nick of time. Together, they kill Gianni and get married."

    "Awake": "Following a car accident where he is forced off of the road by another vehicle, a man awakens with amnesia while a corpse is found in the trunk of his car, the fifth victim of a serial killer that is stalking the area. The man, John Doe, is suspected to be the killer as a result, but escapes the hospital after taking Diana, a nurse who had befriended him, hostage. John becomes determined to prove his innocence and Diana agrees to help him; Diana's father had been convicted of murder and she refused to believe his claims of innocence. He eventually hanged himself, before being exonerated years later, leaving Diana guilt-ridden.\n\nJohn is haunted by visions of Julia Govern, one of the victims and decides to dig deeper in the hopes of finding answers. While visiting Julia's mother's house in McNabb, Illinois, John's memory flashes draw him to the nearby house of Sheriff Roger Bower who has been working with FBI agent Frank Ward to investigate the murders and John's role in them. When John breaks into the Bower house, he is attacked by Bower's son Oliver who appears to recognize him. However, John accidentally knocks Oliver out before he can learn anything about his identity from the young man.\n\nAs John searches for answers, he is hunted by Mark Rosovski, the man that forced him off of the road in the first place. Rosovski snaps the neck of Diana's friend Tom who was helping them and sets an ambush. Upon finding John standing over Tom's body, Diana abandons John, believing that he is really the killer and just manipulating her. Rosovski attempts to strangle John to death, but John manages to shoot him in self-defense, escaping with Rosovski's cell phone. From a text message, John learns that someone else sent him to Tom's home to kill John while Bower, investigating the scene with Ward, identifies Rosovski as a recently paroled hitman.\n\nDiana visits the Bower house to speak with the sheriff about John and meets Oliver who informs her about the death of his mother, who resembles Diana, twenty years before and John's earlier attack on him. At the same time, John visits a library and does some online research into the murders. John learns that Bower's wife was murdered in a similar manner to the current murders and that the lead detective in Julia's murder, Michael Winslow, recently died in a gas explosion that consumed his home. Looking into reports on Michael's death, John discovers from a picture of the detective that he is in fact Michael Winslow. Realizing that the Bower's know the truth about his identity, Michael calls Ward, reveals his true identity and tells him to ask Roger Bower for more answers. When Ward calls Bower and asks about Detective Michael Winslow, the sheriff immediately becomes concerned.\n\nDetermined to find answers, Michael returns to the Bower house and confronts Oliver. Oliver reveals that he and Michael were best friends, but claims that Michael did something that put Oliver and his father through hell due to his obsession with finding out the truth about the murdered girls. During the argument, Michael spots Oliver's baseball schedule and realizes that it matches up with the timing and the locations of the killings. Michael is overpowered by Oliver who has taken Diana captive as well as his intended next victim. Oliver explains that the first victim was an accident, someone that he had unintentionally hit with his car, but she had reminded him of his murdered mother. Mentally ill, Oliver would target young women who resembled his mother, kill them in a fashion matching his mother's unsolved murder and then call their mothers so that the last thing they heard was their own mother's voice. Before Oliver can kill Michael and Diana, Bower returns home and shoots Oliver dead.\n\nSending Diana to call the police, Michael confronts Bower who confirms Michael's identity and explains that Michael had discovered that Oliver was the killer after pulling him over driving the last victim's car with her body in the trunk. Michael had called Bower first who promised to take Oliver in together, but he hired Rosovski instead to protect his son. Rosovski ran Michael off of the road on his way to meet up with Bower to make the arrest and stole his identification, believing that Michael had died in the crash, while Bower switched out his fingerprints for a John Doe from the morgue whose body he planted in Michael's house before setting the gas explosion to cover up Michael's murder. After learning that Michael had in fact survived, Bower sent Rosovski to finish the job while trying to frame Michael for the serial killings in order to protect Oliver as Bower knew that Michael would eventually figure out the truth again. Bower, who had previously had a father-son relationship with Michael before the events, expresses remorse for his actions and for not stopping Oliver sooner. As Michael meets with Ward, who has exonerated him thanks to Diana, and Oliver's body is removed from the house, Bower commits suicide out of guilt while Diana watches the events unfold from across the street.\n\n(Copied from Wikipedia)"

    "Awara Paagal Deewana": "The story centers on the legacy of a dead Indian underworld don Baba Baldev Prasad (Om Puri), who dies of a heart attack. He has left diamonds worth Rs 1000 Crores at the New York Bank. Baldev's next generation includes his son Vikrant (Rahul Dev), his daughter Preeti (Preeti Jhangiani), and Preeti's husband Guru Gulab Khatri (Akshay Kumar). Vikrant and Preeti are step siblings, as Baldev's children from different mothers.\n\nChampaklal (Asrani) is Baldev's lawyer. Baldev himself did not trust Vikrant, but had full faith in Guru. Baldev had left a will in which all his estate was split equally between Vikrant, Preeti, and Guru, which included the diamonds as well. To claim the diamonds, all three benefactors must be present at the bank or, if dead, their death certificates must be presented. If all 3 die, the diamonds will go to Champaklal. And if Champaklal dies, the diamonds will go to an animal welfare trust. Preeti and Guru are married only in name as Baldev got them married. But they do not stay together. Preeti wants to divorce Guru, but he refuses.\n\nShortly after Baldev's death, Vikrant attempts to eliminate Guru by assassinating the Indian home minister in full view of television cameras while disguised as him. Guru flees to the US disguised as someone else to escape prosecution in India.\n\nGuru moves to the street where Anmol (Aftab Shivdasani) and his family live. Anmol is married to Mona (Amrita Arora). Anmol is a dentist and his secretary is Tina (Aarti Chabria). Tina is a big fan of mafia dons. Mona is a dominant wife and demands that Anmol does all the housework and also hand over all of his earnings to her. Anmol recognizes Guru from the news as a wanted criminal from India. Guru warns Anmol not to reveal his identity to anyone, especially the police. But Guru likes Anmol and his father-in-law Manilal, and their innocence. Manilal forgets the names of the people around him and also forgets his name too. Manilal cares for Anmol and does not approve of how Mona treats him.\n\nAnmol's mother-in-law Paramjeet (Supriya Pilgaonkar) forces him to go to India, along with his father-in-law, Manilal (Paresh Rawal) to tell Vikrant about Guru and get the reward of Rs 2 Crores.\n\nVikrant's goons, Yeda Anna and Chota Chathri, pick up Anmol and Manilal from their India hotel and take them to Vikrant. Anmol sees Preeti and falls in love with her. He is heartbroken to find that Preeti is married to Guru. Everything turns wrong when Vikrant doesn't give the reward and instead sends Anmol and Manilal back to the USA with his hired men, Yeda Anna (Sunil Shetty) and Chota Chathri (Johnny Lever) to kill Guru. Anmol figures out Vikrant's plan and calls Guru from India to warn him. Preeti reaches out to Anmol and says that she wants to divorce Guru in exchange for her share of the diamonds. Anmol admits his feelings to Preeti.\n\nAnmol, Manilal, Yeda and Chota return to the US. Later, they find out that Yeda Anna was a double agent: He was working for Guru the whole time because he offered more money. Yeda calls Vikrant, that Anmol's information is correct and asks Vikrant to come to the US. Yeda and Chota are asked to stay with Manilal and Anmol, and they both terrorize their wives who now start respecting their husbands. Yeda and Chota learn that the whole tussle is for diamonds worth Rs 1000 Crores. Yeda is not happy at receiving only Rs 5 Crores from Guru and wants the whole thing.\n\nTina is smitten with Guru and asks Anmol to introduce her to Guru. Tina knows Guru's whole history and Guru is impressed with her. Meanwhile, realizing the Yeda will get the money from Guru, Mona tries to seduce him. The group receive Vikrant and Preeti at the airport and drive to the hotel.\n\nAt the hotel, Vikrant is kidnapped by a mysterious group of Chinese goons. Yeda Anna receives a phone call and finds out that the kidnapped Vikrant was a duplicate of the real one and the real one was going to come later by a private plane. They kill the second Vikrant (who arrived later by plane) and put his body in a car and leave it by the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nWith Vikrant's death, Preeti and Guru each get half of the diamonds. When they are outside the bank, a group of policemen arrest them and take them to an unknown desert area. It is revealed that Vikrant is still alive, as the original Vikrant got himself kidnapped by Chinese goons. Vikrant gets the diamonds and tries to kill Guru. A fight occurs. At the end of the fight, Guru kills Vikrant. When it's all over, the group ask each other to find out who has the diamonds.\n\nAnmol has them and says he will give them to Guru if he gives Preeti a divorce. Tina convinces Guru to give the divorce to Preeti. Guru arrives at the location selected by Anmol and gets the diamonds, while giving Anmol the divorce papers. Yeda Anna betrays Guru and tries to steal the diamonds. Guru wins in a fight and gives diamonds worth Rs 5 Crores to Yeda Anna while hanging him to a forklift and having him stand on Chota Chathri's shoulders.\n\nIn the end, Anmol and his love, Preet, are seen going to India. Anmol's ex-father-in-law gives him some diamonds that he received from Guru as Preeti's share. Preeti comments that she didn't know that Guru was so nice."

    "Awarapan": "The story line revolves around Shivam (Emraan Hashmi), a heart broken and introvert atheist, gangster, and right-hand man of Bharat Malik (Ashutosh Rana), officially a businessman who runs a chain of hotels in Hong Kong. Shivam is given the responsibility of one of these hotels, which he bears capably and well, making it much more successful than Malik's other hotels. Malik holds Shivam in the highest esteem due to Shivam's loyalty, reliability, and business acumen, and treats him like an adored son whom he entrusts with almost everything - indeed, more so than his biological son, Ronnie (Salil Acharya). This is the cause of much jealousy on Ronnie's part against Shivam, but due to Malik's outspoken support for Shivam, Ronnie does not dare do openly oppose him. Shivam has a very close childhood friend, Kabir (Shaad Randhawa), who assists him with everything.\n\nMalik's brother, Rajan (Ashish Vidyarthi), and Rajan's spoilt son Munna (Purab Kohli) nurture a grudge against Shivam because of Shivam's repeated conflicts with Munna. Munna is mainly responsible for the start of most of these conflicts; he time and again puts Shivam down as Malik's slave, once by murdering an employee of Shivam's hotel who resisted Munna in bed. When Shivam comes to investigate this incident, Munna taunts him, the dead girl, and dares him to tell Malik, resulting in Shivam lashing out against Munna and all his henchmen. This causes an escalation of the feud between Munna, his father Rajan, and Shivam.\n\nOne day, Malik asks Shivam to keep an eye on his young mistress Reema (Mrinalini Sharma), whom he suspects of having an affair with someone else, while he is away on a brief business trip. Reema is a young Pakistani girl, a devout Muslim, and a victim of sex trafficking, whom Malik had 'bought' in the Bangkok flesh market. If Reema is found cheating on Malik, Shivam is to inform him immediately.\n\nIn Shivam's interactions with Reema, he recalls his lost love, Aliyah (Shriya Saran) in a series of flashbacks. Aliyah was a devout Muslim, who Shivam had met by chance in the marketplace one day. The duo eventually fell in love, but when her father saw them together, he wrathfully confronted them, reprimanding Aliyah physically in public for maintaining physical contact with her lover in a non-private place. He also exposed Shivam's gangster background to a shocked Aliyah, leading to Shivam's instantly offering her father his gun, saying that he was willing to let go of everything, start anew, and legitimately provide for Aliyah if he is allowed to be with her. Aliyah's father recovers from his initial surprise quickly, and shoots at Shivam with the gun, who ducks to avoid the bullet. The bullet hits Aliyah instead, killing her and temporarily driving Shivam over the edge. A feeling of guilt and sorrow, at Aliyah having died because he tried to save his own life, remains with him hereafter. Aliyah's father instantly commits suicide when he realizes what he has done.\n\nShivam discovers one night that Reema has a secret boyfriend Bilal (Rehaan Khan), who convinces her to run away with him back to Pakistan. Shivam informs Malik, who orders Reema's elimination. However, when he confronts the couple to eliminate them, she dares him to shoot her, claiming that freedom is her right, requesting mercy \"for God's sake\". Shivam is reminded of Aliyah's religious mannerisms, which bear a strong resemblance to Reema's, and is unable to shoot her, leaving her alive. Malik tries to reach Shivam, who severs contact with the former, leading to Malik finding out about his disobedience.\n\nShivam plans to quickly run away from Hong Kong back to India with Kabir, who is extremely unwilling to do so. Eventually, he betrays Shivam to Malik, whose regard for Kabir goes up. Malik has Shivam captured, and orders Ronnie to torture Shivam until he agrees to kill Reema when Shivam refuses to do so even after Malik offers him a second chance. Malik is shown to be genuinely hurt and sorrowful at what he perceives as Shivam's betrayal, and hands over Shivam's responsibilities in the business to Kabir. Malik makes up the old feud with Rajan and Munna, and merges their gangs and businesses, with Malik demanding that Shivam be brought before him alive so that Malik can kill him personally. This occurs in Kabir's presence, who is bitterly penitent to the point of not wishing to live any more over his betrayal of Shivam.\n\nShivam manages to escape Ronnie, and seeks refuge in the monastery of a monk whom he had once set free from certain death. He recovers from his injuries, and reminded of Aliyah and her belief in freedom, decides to not continue running all his life to save his own skin, but to \"fulfill someone else's dreams\" - namely, unite Bilal and Reema and send them to safety. He manages to save Bilal from Malik's henchmen, led by Kabir, whom Shivam still trusts and regards as his best friend, who tearfully reiterates that he is ready to die for Shivam, as he always was. Kabir takes Bilal to the monastery, where arrangements are made to ship Bilal and Reema to Hong Kong.\n\nShivam tracks Reema, killing Rajan when he taunts Reema and refuses to divulge where she is. At the cost of a knife wound to his side, he tricks Munna into revealing Malik's plans regarding Reema, which are to sell her to the person who \"enjoys\" her the most. Munna tells Shivam everything about it, including the location, believing Shivam to be crippled by his wounds, and is immediately killed by Shivam when he tries to run away upon realizing that is not the case. Shivam finds Reema and Malik, who is madly enraged at Shivam's standing against him, when he had cared for Shivam so much, deriding Shivam's new belief in God and freedom. Shivam kills Malik, escapes with Reema to the shipping docks, where Bilal is waiting. Kabir shows up to fight Malik's men and buy Shivam time, and is brutally murdered in the process. Bilal manages to force a reluctant Reema to escape to the ship, who is loath to leave Shivam behind. Ronnie and his men arrive and Shivam manages to kill them all in a gunfight, but is mortally wounded himself. As he lies dying, he comes to terms with his past, forgiving himself and envisioning Aliyah smiling down upon him. The movie ends with Reema in a conference in Pakistan, where she tells her story of the \"awara\" who sacrificed his life to save her, and incites those present to stand up for victims of trafficking."

    "A\u015boka": "The film opens with Emperor Chandragupta Maurya giving away all his material possessions and taking a Sanyas. His grandson, prince Asoka, claims his grandfather's sword. The emperor explains that the sword is in fact a demon that, whenever unsheathed, craves blood without regard to friend or foe. He throws away the sword, but the prince recovers and unsheathes it whereupon it (accidentally) slashes a couple of birds on a tree.\n\nThe film then takes us a few years ahead. Prince Asoka (Shahrukh Khan), now a brave youth, is battling the chief of Takshila. His general informs him that reinforcements have not arrived. Asoka figures out that his half-brother Susima (Ajith Kumar) has deliberately withheld them but, despite that, he wins using shrewd guerrilla tactics to defeat the enemy. Asoka identifies readily with harsh battle conditions and derives pleasure from victory and death to his enemies.\n\nUpon Asoka's victorious return to Magadha, a second attempt is made on his life, but he survives and challenges one of his stepbrothers to a duel in the arena. Before the duel, Asoka's mother, Queen Dharma, compels the prince to renounce his right and leave the kingdom to lead the life of a common man. The brave prince is naturally disappointed, but he accedes to his mother's wishes and leaves.\n\nIn his travels, Asoka meets a lovely maiden Kaurwaki (Kareena Kapoor) and falls in love with her. Soldiers from the neighboring kingdom of Kalinga are chasing her and her little brother Arya. They are on the run along with their faithful general Bheema (Rahul Dev). After saving their lives, Asoka introduces himself as Pawan thus hiding his true identity. Kaurwaki and Arya are the princess and prince of Kalinga, who fled from their kingdom when the Prime Minister assassinated their parents.\n\nAsoka and Kaurwaki get married, but their union is short lived as Asoka receives word that his mother is unwell. He rushes to Magadha only to find that his mother is quite well and has discovered the conspiracy to remove him from power. The King dispatches Asoka to quell a rebellion in Ujjain. Asoka obeys but first returns to find Kaurwaki. Not able to find her, and not knowing she has gone into hiding, he is informed by Bheema that they were slaughtered and shows him the remains of someone else instead. A heartbroken Asoka attempts suicide, but is saved by Viraat (Danny Denzongpa), who on learning his true identity swears to protect him from all threats.\n\nMad with grief and anger, Asoka embarks on a violent campaign of conquest to seek death. He fights with cold-blooded rage and without desire for his own life yet wins one battle after the next. News of his exploits travels to Magadha and Susima sends soldiers to assassinate him fearing that Asoka's popularity might cost him the throne. However, Asoka is saved in the nick of time by Viraat and taken to a Buddhist monastery to recover.\n\nThere he meets a Buddhist maiden, Devi (Hrishita Bhatt), who cares for him. Even here, Susima's spies attempt to assassinate Asoka. In an attempt, Devi accidentally kills the assassin, and in Buddhist tradition, no one will now accept Devi as a wife. Asoka marries Devi in return and returns in splendor to Magadha.\n\nAt this point, Susima and his brothers are wild with anger regarding their futile attempts to eliminate Asoka. They make their last political move, bribing the court astrologer to murder Devi (pregnant with Asoka's child now). The plot fails and Queen Dharma is killed instead. Asoka, now angered beyond measure, kills Susima and all his half-brothers (except Sugrata, who escapes and seeks asylum in Kalinga). Asoka is anointed Emperor but carries the title of Chanda Asoka (Brutal Asoka). Meanwhile, Devi, bent on swaying Asoka to peaceful ways, is shocked at this unbridled brutality and keeps on pushing him to adopt a gentler path.\n\nA few months later, Princess Kaurwaki and Prince Arya return to Kalinga with Bheema and through a dramatic turn of events, have the Prime Minister executed for treason. Prince Arya ascends the throne, but the celebrations are short-lived as Asoka declares war on the kingdom after they give shelter to his half-brother Sugrata. Kaurwaki still does not know that Asoka is Pawan, and they prepare for war.\n\nConsumed with rage toward Sugrata and Kalinga, Asoka nearly kills Viraat who begs him to stop the carnage and a terrible war is fought in Kalinga. The Magadha army suffers defeat initially, but the tide turns, and the Magadha army inflicts a cruel defeat on Kalinga. Not content with mere victory, Asoka's warriors raze everything and butcher everyone in sight. Sugrata is slain, as is Bheema, while Kaurwaki is wounded.\n\nIn his chambers that evening, Asoka is informed by his brother Vitasoka (Madhu Varshitt), who has taken up Buddhism, that Devi has delivered twins, Mahindra and Sanghamitra. Asoka visits the scene of the battlefield, where he suddenly discovers his horse who was supposed to be in Kaurwaki's possession. With a sudden surge of hope, he frantically searches for Kaurwaki.\n\nAsoka manages to find her in the battlefield where he has a heart-to-heart talk. He apologizes deeply for his actions but is interrupted by prince Arya who is dying after being shot by several arrows. With Arya dying in his arms, Asoka suddenly finds his victory empty. In his attempt to fulfill his goals, he realizes that he only managed to be surrounded with more death. His enemies, his family, and even Arya, all dead, because of him. His grandfather's advice (about the sword) was right.\n\nThe film ends with Asoka throwing the sword at the same spot his grandfather had thrown it and embracing Buddhism. The final narrative describes how Asoka not only built a large empire but spread Buddhism and the winds of peace through it."

    "BLAME!": "The film opens with a young woman in a small village narrating about the events that lead up to the beginning of Blame!\n\nAt an unspecified (and therefore, unknown) time, a massive city was created that eclipsed the entire world and then some. Humans controlled the robots, known as the safeguard, that worked in the city, until a mysterious contagion spread throughout. As a result, all humans were declared \"illegal residents\" by the safeguard, and therefore an extermination order was issued against everyone. Though some humans survived, they're all trapped in the city and still under threat from the safeguard.\n\nAccording to the narrator, it happened \"long before she was born\".\n\nThe scene then cuts to a different time (once again, it's unspecified how long after the contagion), six people, known as \"Electro-fishers\", dressed in advanced gear called \"helmettals\" begin scavenging throughout the city, looking for food and other supplies for their village. They evade the gaze of a \"watchtower\", which would've otherwise alerted the entire safeguard to their location. The leader, Zuru, tries to find a new hunting ground when they've still come up with nothing.\n\nHowever, her friends, Tae and Fusata, worry that they've gotten lost as the route was different on a map (even though the map was way outdated). They then find an exit out of the city block they are in. When they attempt to go to another block, Tae trips and nearly falls, dropping some supplies and a spare battery in order to avoid falling to her death.\n\nWhile Zuru observes their surroundings, a massive \"builder\" suddenly appears, however, it doesn't attack them as builders are uninterested in humans. They then jump a massive gap to another city block and climb to the top of it. They go through a massive, open area that no one has yet explored before. However, security is still tight, with many watchtowers everywhere. The group regret their choice for going that far into the city as the grown-ups have told them not to, furthermore, they took their gear and left without permission from the village elder, \"pops\". Nonetheless, they decide to continue and search for some sludge (their food) for their starving village as well as Tae's sister, Ito.\n\nThey manage to successfully evade the watchtower and by luck, find a sludge pipe. However, the sludge pipe is completely drained and has nothing left in it. They accidentally go into the view of another watchtower which sounds and alarm and sends several robots, known as \"exterminators\" against them. One of the group members is attacked and decapitated by an exterminator. Realizing they're outnumbered and can't win in a fight, they decide to run. However, while Zuru just barely manages to evade some of them, two more members of the group are killed by exterminators. Tae trips and falls down a high slope and gets attacked by an exterminator, which she's unable to shoot in her panic. Zuru jumps over and manages to destroy the exterminator before it can kill Tae, but then falls and crashes into the ground. Several more exterminators continue to chase her, which she's unable to fight back against. Just then, she sees a man up ahead, clad in black, and with many scars on his face. He takes out a small gun and fires a massive laser close to Zuru. She evades the shot, which hits and destroys the exterminators behind her, before exploding against a wall. Zuru gets back up and two more exterminators, which survived the powerful laser, run at her before being destroyed by Tae and Fusata.\n\nWhile being helped up by her friends, Zuru notices a device around the man's neck with a blinking blue light. Just then, the watchtower's siren suddenly stops, to their surprise. The mysterious man calmly demands they take off their headgear so that he can see their eyes. Tae and Fusata advise against this as it will make them more easily detectable by the watchtowers. Nonetheless, after a long pause, Zuru removes her helmettals. Even more to the friends surprise, this doesn't trigger the alarm, although it was supposed to. Tae and then Fusata then take of their helmettals too and show him their faces. He seems to scan their eyes with a built-in scanner in his own eyes.\n\nThe man then asks if there are any humans with the net terminal gene around, confusing the group. Though Zuru wants to thank him for saving them, they don't know what he's talking about. Knowing what he's looking for isn't there, the man starts to leave, but then Zuru states that one of the grown-ups at their village may know what he's talking about. The man stops and Zuru then asks what his name is.\n\nThe man responds that his name is Killy and he's a human.\n\nZuru, Tae, and Fusata guide Killy back to their village, the one place that the safeguard doesn't enter, though they don't know why. Once they get there, the guards, Sutezo and Pops, fire upon Killy, being that he's an unknown outsider. They are also surprised that they're not wearing their helmettals despite the danger that poses, though Fusata explains that they're okay around Killy, who rescued them. However, Sutezo is skeptical and believes that Killy isn't really human, hearing that there are safeguard members who disguise themselves as humans. But Pops believes that Killy is human and allows them all into the village. Killy walks through the perimeter, proving that he's not a safeguard. Pops asks him where he came from, to which he responds \"6,000 levels below\".\n\nIn the village, it used to house around 400 people at one point, but now only has 150, possibly due to exterminator attacks. Their custom is to welcome any outside human travelers due to them being undermanned, though Killy is the first human that generation to actually come. It's said that Electro-Fishers, descended from a line of humans called \"planters\", founded the village 300 years ago, and the remnants of humanity have lived there since then. However, Pops claims that they don't know anything about the outside world (including whether or not there are other human survivors), and any stories from an outsider (hence, Killy) would be valuable information.\n\nKilly is taken into the village where the people are shocked that only 3 of the kids have survived and the victim's equipment has been lost as well (since they don't have the technology to make any more helmettals), even more so that they've still returned empty-handed. The village is suffering a severe food problem and worry that they'll starve in just a month. The villagers look at Killy with confusion and curiosity (again, he's the first outsider they've ever seen) while he scans many of their eyes with his own eyes.\n\nA curious and excited little girl runs up to Killy to meet him. He then reaches in his back pocket and gives the little girl a small, yellow, brick-like object. A boy takes the brick and examines it briefly, it's hard as a rock, but a small drawing on the side of it says to drop it in water. He then drops it into a pool of water, where it suddenly morphs and grows to a gigantic size, some of the villagers eat it, finding it soft, good-tasting, and highly nutritious, therefore nourishing the entire village. Although he looks menacing with his many scars, permanent scowl, and softspoken attitude, Killy proves himself to be kind. One of the leaders of the village, Fuku tells the kids that she's glad they made it back, but asks them to not do it again.\n\nPops then asks to talk with Killy in private, thanking him for feeding their village and asking Killy where he obtained that food. Killy responds that it's from 200 levels below, meaning that it's impossible to get anymore (since not human has ever gone through ONE level). He once again asks for any humans with the Net Terminal Gene, to which Sutezo responds he's never heard of it. However, Pops then states that he has heard something about it, and that a \"rotting shrine\" beneath their village may provide some information. However, they've been told through generations to avoid it (Sutezo even believes that there's a ghost that possesses and trespassers, and caused his grandfather to fall to his death on the way down). Nonetheless, Killy immediately starts walking away towards the rotting shrine without any word, to which Zuru, Pops, and Sutezo (reluctantly) follow him.\n\nUpon going to the bottom of the perimeter, far below the village, Killy and the group find a strange, glitchy, red hologram of a woman that speaks very distorted and seems to be saying nonsense. Killy walks through the hologram, which immediately disappears, then lifts a massive piece of rubble, finding a decayed head of a woman underneath it. He picks up the head and slams it against the wall a couple of times, to which it then suddenly sparks to life and begins talking with a speaker implanted in it's throat.\n\nThe woman identifies herself as Cibo, a scientist who existed since before the contagion began. She's been waiting for 17,526,000 hours (over 2,000 years) for someone to come, attempting to call for help all that time, to no avail until now. Killy scans her and finds traces of the contagion in her irises, meaning she doesn't have the Net Terminal Gene. Cibo states that she and her scientists have been attempting to work on a synthetic terminal since the extermination began in an attempt to communicate with the Safeguard's A.I, the Authority, and end the robots extermination. She even created a barrier device to keep the Safeguard out while they did their experiments (hence, the reason why the villagers have been able to live there), however, they all died before their project could yield results. She then states that there is a factory to the north of the village that may still be in use, and that can produce literally anything, including a synthetic terminal. Killy at first meets this statement with skepticism, but Cibo insists that such a thing is, in fact, possible. Pops then asks her if she can create more of the \"food bricks\" that Killy brought back for the village. Cibo responds that she can, but only when they get to the factory.\n\nKilly, now convinced, then once again starts walking away without any thought or words, therefore Pops decides to gather a group to go to the factory with him. However, Cibo states that the factory is 15 blocks away, a journey that would take a few days and require plenty of their limited food for the trip. They hastily assemble a group with as many Electro-Fishers as there are helmettals remaining including Pops, Sutezo, Zuru, Tae (who's sister is doing better), and Fusata, and follow outside the perimeter.\n\nAlong the way, they see a watchtower that has a clear view through a crack in the ceiling above them. There's no way around, but they then see Killy walk by it with no problem and without setting off the alarm. They follow him closely and find that they too have the ability to walk by the watchtower in full view without setting off the alarm, as long as they're behind him, naturally.\n\nThat night, they stop to rest in an abandoned apartment building, preparing gruel made out of sludge to eat. Fuku offers some to Killy who simply remains silent. Cibo states that his metabolism levels are different from a regular human, and that he rarely needs to eat at all. Not to mention that Cibo is still only an exoskeleton and doesn't need to eat either. The rest of the group talk about a strange, stinging smell that the safeguard emits, apparently smelling of ions, though Zuru doesn't remember the smell very well. As Killy sits awake and motionless, Cibo recounts the events before and during the contagion, wherein the Safeguard suddenly lost control and declared all humans to be \"illegal residents\". She and her scientist friends tried to do what they could, but she's the only survivor, as the rest of them have died.\n\nAlong the trip, the group then come to a dark corridor, apparently, no on who ever went in there has ever returned back (due to exterminators). The group are fearful and reluctant to move ahead, until Killy then nonchalantly walks by, giving them more confidence as Killy and anyone who's close to him seem immune to the sensors of the Safeguard. They come to the door of the factory, which Cibo then opens up with a code, allowing the group to go in.\n\nThey find the inside of the factory to be a massive corridor with many empty experiment nodes and no exterminators in sight. Killy then puts Cibo on the main console in front of them, at her request. She gains access into the factory and then activates a node which produces a massive amount of \"food bricks\" as promised to the electro-fishers, who are overjoyed at the sight and start stuffing their backpacks with them. Cibo then begins to activate another node for the synthetic terminal which she wants Killy to get. However, she warns him that the last time she got that far into the system, things ended badly.\n\nSuddenly, while Killy walks to the terminal, Cibo seems to be having trouble before the entire system shuts down, to the worry of the group. The system then turns back on, and several nodes further away activate without Cibo doing anything, revealing that it has spawned several exterminators. The group hastily finish packing their packs and start firing at the exterminators, though Tae is forced to leave her pack behind to start running, and Cibo is knocked off and crushed by one of them. The group splits up and retreats towards the entrance to the factory while Killy stays behind to get the terminal. He fires his Gravitational Beam Emitter at several exterminators before destroying a surviving one with a knife he carries, to the surprise of the retreating group.\n\nAs the group attempts to regroup, Zuru worries when she doesn't hear back from Tae. A group member then shows up, but is immediately killed by an exterminator, and another member, Atsuji, is wounded in the leg after destroying it. Zuru then hastily asks the other member where Tae is, to which he responds that she was crushed by an exterminator. She hurries back to find Tae having survived the attack despite a broken arm. The exterminator then jumps up at them before Fusata and Sutezo destroy it in the nick of time. Fusata being as overjoyed as Zuru that Tae has survived.\n\nBack inside the factory, another node suddenly activates, and a humanoid-looking robot emerges.\n\nThe group is then cornered in the outside of the factory by the safeguard, and are unable to destroy them all, whereas Killy is unable to fire his weapon (presumably because it needs to charge). Suddenly, when all seems lost, a laser beam shoots between the group and the exterminators, who seem to stop behind it. The savior is revealed to be the humanoid robot, who is in fact Cibo who uploaded herself into the robot. She guides them to a train car that'll lead back to their village. However, the temporary barrier that she fired will soon wear off, and Atsuji asks to be left behind so as not to slow down the group, though Zuru refuses to do so. They all make it to the train car which Cibo powers up. However, the barrier wears off, and some exterminators grab onto the train car as it moves, the group doesn't have enough spears to fight them all off. Cibo states her regret to Killy, as they have managed to get the terminal and food, but won't make it back. To this, as the group runs out of spears, Killy injects himself with something in the neck which seems to boost but also weaken him, and fires a shot which destroys the rest of the exterminators, before then passing out.\n\nThe group returns to their village with the unconscious Killy and the terminal, as well as Cibo in tow, though Tae seems to be acting a little strangely.\n\nFusata walks Tae back to her home while the villagers treat Atsuji and any other wounded, while also being surprised at the tall and strong appearance of Cibo. Sutezo doesn't know whether or not Killy's alive, but Cibo insists that he's just sleeping. They take him inside and let him rest.\n\nThat night, the Villagers celebrate the amount of food they've gotten and gather together for a party. Pops brings down the lights and leads a moment of silence for all the people they've lost, before allowing the people to continue eating, they now can become more nourished thanks to all the \"food bricks\" the group brought back. However, it's impossible to go back to the factory due to the vast presence of exterminators in it, though they've at least bought more time for the village and prevented them from starving for a while.\n\nZuru goes to Killy, who's still sleeping, and talks to him. She states that Cibo's experiment may be successful and stop the safeguard once and for all, and asks if he will still continue his mission even if it does. She then pauses for a moment, and asks him if he could stay, having grown fond of him during their short time together. However, Cibo walks in and wakes Killy up, asking him to help her while she connects the synthetic terminal, as she cannot move and needs protection. As they leave, Zuru worries that her words fell on deaf ears with Killy.\n\nThough Pops hopes that Cibo's experiment will work, Sutezo meets it with skepticism, worrying that it will lead to another catastrophe as it did 2,000 years ago. Fusata decides to take some food to the injured Tae.\n\nMeanwhile, someone suddenly walks into the armory and takes one of the spearguns with them secretly.\n\nSutezo goes to Zuru, asking her if she talked to Killy, but Zuru simply states that she didn't and walks away, wanting to be left alone. Pops helps Fuku carry supplies to storage. They all then meet up on top of the common area and see Fusata walking by. Zuru praises him for being considerate and kind to Tae, but he states that Tae wasn't in her room. Suddenly, they hear a noise and see that it's Tae walking around and dragging a speargun beside her. She aims off the side of the village while Fusata attempts to stop her, however, she fires the speargun, which destroys the barrier generator protecting the village. Suddenly, the watchtower outside detects the village and sounds the alarm, and a powerful vortex generates around Tae, which cuts off Pops' arm when he prevents a shocked Fusata from touching it.\n\nThe truth is then revealed, Tae did not survive the factory. Instead, a humanoid-looking robot scanned her before killing her, then disguised itself as Tae to infiltrate the village.\n\nThe intruder reveals itself as an advanced safeguard named Sanakan who was to infiltrate the village and terminate all humans. Fusata then reels further into shock and disbelief at this, therefore Sanakan aims it's much more powerful Gravitational Beam Emitter at him. Fuku manages to push him out of the way, but is killed by the beam herself. Sanakan then turns it's attention to the village members in the common area, firing through the roof and killing many of them.\n\nKilly and Cibo then notice Sanakan's destruction of the area, surprised that it got through the barrier. Cibo states that they should hurry, but Killy immediately starts running back to the village to protect them, leaving Cibo defenseless.\n\nPops, Sutezo, Zuru, and Fusata, who snaps out of his shock, manage to escape from Sanakan, who then turns it's attention to the upper levels, contacting the watchtower for exterminators to kill the remaining humans, before then firing at the upper village, causing chaos up there as well.\n\nThe electro-fishers gear up and get ready to fight the exterminators, though they run out of helmettals and Sutezo goes without one so that Zuru can have her's\n\nKilly, still out of effective range of Sanakan, notices the electro-fishers struggling to fight the seemingly endless horde of exterminators. He detects the watchtower just outside the wall, then fires a shot at it, destroying the watchtower and the bridge to prevent anymore exterminators from coming in.\n\nCibo then reaches the rotting shrine and activates the synthetic terminal and connects herself to the network.\n\nZuru runs out to help with defending the village, but is then stopped by Fusata who's still in shock and denial over Tae's death. Zuru snaps him out of it, then runs ahead, giving him the last helmettal to protect himself, leaving without one herself.\n\nSanakan continues to cause more chaos throughout the upper village. Sutezo sneaks around and shoots it in the head, but to no effect due to it's advanced armor. Sanakan shoots at him, but misses, then goes in for another shot, only for a sudden large explosion to disrupt it's detection system. Killy then appears through the explosion and punches it in the face, hard enough to throw it back. He then gets into a fight with it, destroying the floor beneath them, causing them both to fall a high height, yet still survive, much to the surprise of Sutezo. They get into another fight, wherein Killy's about to destroy Sanakan, however, it pushes him back and shoots off his right arm with it's Gravitation Beam Emitter, causing him to lose his own weapon, before they then fall from even higher.\n\nKilly and Sanakan crash onto the ground near the bottom of the village, while rubble and debris fall around them. Killy attempt to fight it with his knife, but is knocked down and beaten by Sanakan, who scans him and reveals that he's not a human, but a body stolen from the Safeguard (possibly implying that he's a sentient safeguard, or a cybernetically advanced human). It then offers him an ultimatum, to return to the safeguard or be destroyed, to which Killy picks the latter option. However, right as it's about to destroy him, Cibo accesses the netsphere, which Sanakan detects and turns it's attention to destroying Cibo, right below them. Right as it's about to fire, Sutezo fires two spears into it's upgraded weapon, throwing off it's aim and causing it to miss Cibo. Sanakan then fires at Sutezo, killing him.\n\nZuru, shocked at this, and having retrieved Killy's Gravitational Beam Emitter, signals out to Killy and tosses it to him. He then breaks free from Sanakan and catches his weapon, firing at it, only for it to deflect the beam with it's hand, before then firing a small laser beam at Cibo, destroying her robotic body.\n\nWith no options left, Killy injects himself with three of the syringes he injected earlier, all at once. Sanakan prepares to block it, but this time, it's far too powerful and is completely destroyed once and for all.\n\nThe Electro-Fishers finally destroy the last of the exterminators, saving their village, including Fusata, who snapped out of his shock.\n\nMeanwhile, Cibo, who's arm is still intact and still contains her memories, gains access to the Netsphere, and finds the Authority, which controls the safeguard. However, the Authority states that the synthetic terminal is ineffective and her connection will be cut off in a few nanoseconds (though her perception of time is faster, therefore she has plenty of time). Cibo asks the Authority to at least stop the attack on the village, but it states that they can't do so without an order from someone with the Net Terminal Gene. However, they offer to give her information and coordinates of abandoned levels that the safeguard isn't monitoring. They give her a map of the entire city, information that can't be given to the real world, but they are allowed to let Cibo access it.\n\nMeanwhile, the Villagers take account of their losses and injuries, lead by Fusata. Killy returns, and asks a villager to tape his arm back on. Pops thanks him for saving the village from Sanakan. However, the villagers don't know what happened to Cibo and believe that they'll all die in just a few minutes. However, Cibo's arm then shows up, stating that the exterminators will show up again and the village is no longer safe, however, there is an abandoned level just below them with a descending lift nearby.\n\nThe Villagers decide to abandon their village and make for the descending track to the abandoned level. Along the way, Pops thanks Zuru for taking the kids out hunting, stating that her actions lead to the survival of their people. Once there, Cibo activates the lift, however, a watchtower detects them all and raises a silent alarm to the Safeguard. Suddenly, it starts spawning a massive exterminator close to the villagers who hurry and board the lift. However, Killy stays behind, despite Cibo's objections. Zuru asks Killy what he's doing, and after a long pause, he takes off his necklace and tosses it to her. Tearful, Zuru asks if they'll see him again. After another long pause, Killy responds that he's looking for the Net Terminal Gene. Cibo, realizing he won't come, descends the lift. The massive exterminator then spawns behind Killy and his fires at it with his Gravitational Beam Emitter, causing a massive explosion that engulfs and destroys it while the villagers watch.\n\nThe narrator then comes back again, stating that was the last they ever saw of him. The narrator reveals herself to be the granddaughter of Zuru, as the villagers had arrived at the abandoned level and were able to create a new village and live in safety. She had been told all about Killy by Zuru, the city hasn't yet changed, meaning that a net terminal gene hasn't been found yet. However, the narrator has faith that Killy is still out there, looking for it.\n\nThe final shot shows Killy going to the top of a city block, presumably continuing his search until he saves the human race."

    "Baadshah": "Sadhu Bhai is an international syndicate leader who conquered the underworld of entire southeast Asia, and no one dared to challenge him. Baadshah enters the underworld for his father Dhanraj. Sadhu's partner Crazy Robert captures Baadshah and Dhanraj. Baadshah defeats Robert's goons. However, he learns that both the Indian police led by ACP Aadi and IG Ramchandar and the Hong Kong police are out to catch him.\n\nIn Milan, Italy, Janaki is a social worker who lives with her uncle Pilli Gopi Krishna Simha and cousins Inky and Pinky. She meets Baadshah alias Rama Rao when he acts as if he is attempting suicide. Janaki introduces him to various people who attempted suicide but found hope for life through her inspiration. One such person is a poet named Dasu, who is actually a slacker. Rama Rao immediately discovers Dasu's true nature and buys him off to help him in making Janaki fall in love with him.\n\nMeanwhile, Ramchandar leads a police funeral for DIG Balram. Aadi and the police force think that Baadshah killed Balram, so Aadi vows to kill him. Meanwhile, Baadshah fights off Sadhu's henchman Rakhi Rasul, who comes looking for him. Unfortunately, one of Baadshah's right-hand men is killed by Robert when he refuses to give information about Baadshah.\n\nFlashback: Dhanraj runs a casino for Sadhu and runs a group of casinos in Macau, where Sadhu's syndicate gets half of its entire income. Although Sadhu is the most powerful underworld don in Asia along with his right-hand men Vikram and Rasul, he was never able to conquer Hong Kong due to Robert's brother, a drug lord Violent Victor and his son Ruthless Johnny's control. When Dhanraj attempts to transfer the money from the casino to Sadhu through Hong Kong, Johnny stops Dhanraj's henchmen and tries to steal the money. Baadshah then fends off Johnny's men. Sadhu asks Baadshah to recover his henchmen Antony, who was kidnapped by Victor.\n\nUnknown to Sadhu, it was Baadshah who kidnapped Antony. Baadshah demands control over Macau in return, to which Sadhu. Baadshah uses this as an opportunity to attack Johnny's place, recover several flood victim children (with whom Johnny planned to do illegal organ business), and kill Johnny. Baadshah then hands over Antony to Sadhu as if he had recovered him from Victor. Victor surrenders Hong Kong to Sadhu to seek his help in avenging his son's death. Sadhu accepts the offer when he finds out that Baadshah was behind Antony's kidnap and played a game with him to get Macau.\n\nIt is revealed that Baadshah's intent on entering the mafia world was to defeat Sadhu and conquer his empire with his uncle Ganesh. Sadhu sends his men to kill Baadshah, but Ganesh is killed instead. Baadshah kills Victor and his accomplices, and Sadhu joins forces with Robert. Meanwhile, Ramchandar finds out that Sadhu is shipping RDX from Hong Kong to India and sends a team headed by Balram and ACP Aadi to intercept the container. In Hong Kong, Balram and Aadi attack Sadhu's gang. However, Aadi betrays and brutally kills Balram, also revealing that he is the mole in the police department working with Sadhu.\n\nThe container is successfully transported to India. Aadi makes sure that Baadshah is framed for Balram's murder. Robert then kidnaps Dhanraj and captures Baadshah. Baadshah finds out and reveals to Ramchandar about Aadi's betrayal. Ramachandar tells Baadshah that Janaki is engaged to Aadi and that they will be married in a few weeks. Gopi agrees to help Baadshah and Janaki. Janaki, Baadshah, Gopi, Inky, Pinky, and Dasu travel to India.\n\nPresent: Meanwhile, Sadhu plans several bomb blasts in all major cities in India with the RDX on the day of the WSIS in Hyderabad. Baadshah enters Janaki's household by posing as wedding planner Rama Rao. Janaki's household is headed by her father Dr Jaya Krishna Simha IPS, a strict and disciplined Commissioner of the IPS in Andhra Pradesh who expects all the men in the family to be disciplined police officers.\n\nHowever, Padmanabha Simha is lazy and becomes an inspector due to Jaya's influence. Aadi and his father arrive at Jaya's house for Aadi and Janaki's wedding. Rama Rao uses this as an opportunity to trap Aadi and reach Sadhu. When Rasul and Robert enter the city to carry out planned bomb blasts, Rama Rao goes with Padmanabha and kills Rasul. Padmanabha takes credit for the murder, and the police confiscate the RDX. Rama Rao's mother finds out that her son is Baadshah and becomes disgusted, though she later finds out from Ramchandar why he became Baadshah.\n\nFlashback: Before Rama Rao entered the mafia, he, along with his adoptive brother Siddhu and his mother were living happily. Sadly, on the day when Rama Rao was to leave for the US for a software job, Siddhu was killed in a bomb blast that Sadhu planted. Rama Rao applies for a position in the IPS but gets rejected by the whole department because Dhanraj was working under Sadhu, and no one with a criminal family history is allowed into the police department.\n\nRamchandar asks Rama Rao to go undercover as Baadshah and infiltrate the mafia to extract information about Sadhu, and in return, all criminal charges against Dhanraj will be dropped. Rama Rao joins the syndicate as Baadshah to avenge Siddu's death.\n\nPresent: After learning this, Rama Rao's mother apologizes for not trusting him, and he reunites her with a reformed Dhanraj. Later at the Sangeet ceremony, Aadi spikes the juice with alcohol (actually meant for Padmanabha so that he can reveal Baadshah's identity), making everyone at the ceremony drunk. Jaya gets enraged and has a public dispute with Aadi and his father. Sadhu comes to Hyderabad and kills the police informer that notified the police of the RDX and Rasul's location.\n\nSadhu then makes Aadi kidnap Ramchandar and captures Padmanabha. Padmanabha Simha soon finds out that he had been used by Baadshah. Aadi and Sadhu then attempt to leave India from an airport base, but Baadshah intervenes. Ramchandar reveals that Baadshah aka Rama Rao has been appointed as the new IGP and that he was hired when he recovered the RDX and proved his worth. Baadshah kills Sadhu and his goons as well as Robert and beats up and arrests Aadi and his father, thus ending Operation Baadshah. He then gets engaged to Janaki, and Jaya is happy that another police officer is becoming part of his household."

    "Baadshah": "Raj (Shahrukh Khan) is a detective. Under a pseudonym, \"Baadshah\", he runs Baadshah Detective Agency out of a Mumbai office. In his employ are several individuals - Rocky, Bhola, Chauki Lal, and chief assistant Ram Lal (Johnny Lever). He receives little business, and is desperate for a big break. Though he manages to retrieve a businessman's diamonds from a mustached Wild West-style villain named Manikchand (who happens to be working in collaboration with the businessman's crooked underling, Saxena) in a casino through trickery and athleticism, he ends up losing the reward money as a result of being responsible for the casino needing extensive repairs.\n\nSuraj Singh Thapar (Amrish Puri) is a business tycoon whose bio-chemical plant is due to be shut down following a preventable industrial accident by the popular and uncompromising Chief Minister of Goa, Gayatri Bachchan. When bribery attempts fail, he resolves to have her killed. For the job, he has Rani, his young Hench-woman, hire Shiva, Mumbai's notorious contract-killer. Meanwhile, a man by the name of K. Jhunjhunwala comes to Baadshah with a strange case. Jhunjhunwala claims that he is dying as a result of a brain tumor and wants to see his daughter married to the suitable bachelor accompanying him, Nitin, before he dies. The young woman, Seema (Twinkle Khanna), is, however, unprepared to marry Nitin, who she knows as a friend - hence the need for Baadshah's help. Baadshah takes it upon himself to woo the girl and later dump her in order to fulfill the dying man's request and create some much-needed revenue.\n\nBaadshah pretends to be blind and, after serenading Seema in a hotel lobby and subsequently getting slapped, draws her to his \"apartment\". There, as \"Raj\", he gains her sympathy and affection. Completely taken, Seema gives in to his request for money for an eye operation that might restore his vision. Ramlaal performs the fake surgery. Overjoyed, Seema embraces Raj, her new love, and they begin a romance. Baadshah promptly breaks Seema's heart by revealing the lies. Nitin rushes to comfort her, and Baadshah collects his payment. However, his feelings for her prove to be genuine.\n\nUnbeknownst to Baadshah, Jhunjhunwala and Nitin are actually a father-son bank fraud team wanted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The marriage of Nitin to Seema, who is actually the sister of CBI Secret Agent Deepak Malhotra, is actually meant to stop investigation into the bank fraud case by way of family connections. The plan fails, however, when Agent Malhotra promptly arrests the Jhunjhunwalas before the marriage can take place.\n\nMeanwhile, it is revealed by the CBI that Shiva's attempt on Chief Minister Gayatri Bachchan's life failed as a result of his death in a car accident. Fearing a second attempt, CBI headquarters tasks Agent Malhotra with investigating and providing further protection for the minister in Goa. The mission is given the code-name \"Operation Maa\", and Malhotra is assigned the code-name \"Baadshah\". Rani, by listening in on Malhotra's communications with a fellow agent, finds out his flight information, and unites with her boyfriend, Moti, who was recently released from prison. As per Thapar's instructions, she is to travel with Moti to the airport, where the latter will eliminate Secret Agent \"Baadshah\" and assume his identity in order to gain access to Bachchan and carry out the assassination. At the same time, Baadshah (the detective) gets a second job from the businessman he first worked for. Manikchand and Saxena, wanting to regain the diamonds they originally stole, kidnapped the businessman's daughter for ransom. Baadshah and his assistants are given tickets to Goa, where the girl is being held. Both \"Baadshahs\" are scheduled to be on the same flight. Baadshah, through a misunderstanding, receives Agent Malhotra's ticket at the counter, while Agent Malhotra, who received Baadshah's ticket, is identified as the CBI's \"Baadshah\" by Rani when he picks it up. Moti shoots Malhotra, who is briefly seen by Baadshah being wheeled away. A computer disk drops from his wheel chair, which Baadshah keeps after trying to give back.\n\nAt this point, Baadshah has functionally switched places with the deceased agent. Because he is sitting in the agent's assigned seat on the plane, another CBI agent dispatched to aid him approaches and gives him an identification flower. This draws the attention of Rani, who now thinks that Moti killed the wrong man. Rani poisons the remaining CBI agent, and tries to poison Baadshah, but fails. When the passengers disembark, yet another CBI agent identifies Baadshah as the secret agent by the flower he is wearing, and rushes him away to a CBI laboratory. As they pass, Seema and her partner, Uncle Tom, previously expecting Agent Malhotra, identify Baadshah as Raj, the heartbreaking liar, and wonder what happened to Malhotra (Seema's brother). At the laboratory, confusion prevails, as nobody is able to come to the realization that things are not as they are supposed to be. Baadshah is equipped with a James Bond-style car and an assortment of top-secret gadgets. He is also congratulated on the Jhunjhunwala case, which he initially thinks is his marriage setup. A newspaper article on it reveals the truth, and though he realizes that Seema could yet be his for the taking, he is unable to see the bigger picture.\n\nBaadshah is followed on the road after departing, both by Moti and Rani and by Seema. While trying to roll down the high-tech car's windows, he accidentally fends off the murderous couple. Failing to attract Seema's attention, he retires to his hotel for the night. By this time, his companions have been taken by Manikchand and Saxena to their rented hideout, where they also secretly hold the girl. Baadshah learns that the two men now hold all of his friends hostage, and that he must now rescue the lot of them. At the hotel, Baadshah discovers that Seema has taken the computer disk from his possession. He is then given a note from Seema, requesting a meeting. He goes to see her in the parking garage, where she confronts him with an obviously unloaded pistol. While demonstrating the proper usage of the weapon, Baadshah is jumped by Moti. The two fight back and forth, until a dog forces both of them to seek safety on top of a car. Baadshah escapes by singing to the dog, while Moti is mauled and is driven into a trash can.\n\nSeema flees. She and Uncle Tom search the computer disk and see that Agent Malhotra suspected Thapar as the man behind the assassination attempt. Seema goes to Thapar's night club in order to get information from him, only to encounter Baadshah there as well. More confusion ensues, as Baadshah is mistaken as Moti by Thapar and a hit-man by Seema, and Thapar is mistaken as the businessman's assistant by Baadshah. Baadshah says that he will deliver the girl to Thapar's address. Thapar thinks this is code for the delivery of Bachchan's dead body. To cap off the eventful night, Baadshah performs an epic musical number in front of a raucous crowd.\n\nHaving been in communication with Manikchand and Saxena all along, Baadshah arranges an exchange of the hostages for the diamonds at an abandoned construction site after meeting them at a school event where Gayatri Bachchan was speaking. Finding the girl and his men unharmed, Baadshah attacks the criminal duo with exploding toffee and comes away with all of the stolen goods and the culprits in custody. Sending Ram Lal and the others to Thapar's address (where he thinks they are to meet up with the businessman), Baadshah drives the kidnappers towards town. While en route, he finds Seema being chased by armed men, who were sent after her by a corrupt security agent at the chief minister's event after she tried alerting him of Baadshah's potentially deadly presence. The detective saves Seema, and tells her and Uncle Tom his side of the story and the truth about earlier events. Seema, in turn, briefs Baadshah on the overall situation. Though they are able to kiss and make up, they find themselves in dire straits. Seema's brother is now known to be dead, and Baadshah's friends are in Thapar's custody. Baadshah, equipped with a radio link to Seema, goes to Thapar's house to try talking his way out of the mess. Thapar, now wise to the goings on, forces Baadshah to assassinate Bachchan himself using his secret agent status. Should he fail to do so, Thapar will kill everyone.\n\nAll of the key players travel to the Holiday Inn where the Chief Minister is to speak. The girl is forced to wear a bomb vest and sit in a van watched by Moti. Baadshah's assistants are kept in a high-rise room with a gun trained on them by Rani. The entire on-site security force is in cahoots with Thapar, keeping tabs on Baadshah inside the hotel. He manages to escape momentarily, with the help of a secretary, informing the chief minister's husband of the plot. Unfortunately, the husband is in on it himself, and, after killing the secretary, forces Baadshah to get back to the task. Now, with additional help desperately needed, Seema recruits the hotel staff, who give Baadshah his CBI-issued bag of tricks. This allows him to rescue his assistants from Rani. He proceeds to shoot Moti, leaving Ram Lal and the others to tend to the bomb. Seema puts a message in with the chief minister's speech script.\n\nBaadshah is forced to approach the chief minister, as Thapar still has control of the bomb. At that moment, she reads the note and learns of the impending danger, as well as her husbands' involvement in the plot. However, it being too late, Baadshah is forced to open fire upon the security personal, wounding a great many of them. Thapar, in response, takes a few shots at Bachchan himself, but her Sikh bodyguard comes between her and the bullets. Thapar prepares to fire once more, but Baadshah disarms him. Thapar then goes for the bomb switch, but the van containing the girl comes crashing through a glass wall and comes to rest in the midst of the action. Needing room to detonate the bomb, Thapar flees, and is pursued by Baadshah while the CBI scientist works on the bomb. The two men struggle for control of the remote on some scaffolding, but eventually it is Thapar who comes away with it. While Baadshah clings to a pipe, Thapar runs outside, and has Moti and Rani detonate the bomb while he sits in his getaway car. Unfortunately for him, the bomb was previously removed from the girl and thrown under said car, leading to his explosive demise.\n\nBaadshah, having been rescued by his friends using a curtain slide, is seen to have booming business back at the detective agency. Ram Lal receives a call from Mr. Clint Eastwood, apparently secretary to American President Bill Clinton, offering $1,000,000 for assistance with the \"Monica Case\". Baadshah then announces his prioritization of \"wife duty\", refusing the case and disappearing with Seema on a retractable bed into the wall of the detective agency. The audience is left with a framed photograph of Baadshah, as a baby wearing a fireman's helmet."

Ronny then remembered that Neha told him in the car that Riya is the beautiful thing of their relationship which has now become only a beautiful memory. ACP also told Ronny that Shekhar confessed his crime. Shekhar also confessed that he did all this because he got to know from his doctor that he is sterile and Riya is not his daughter.

Baby was formed in response to the 26/11 attacks to create a secretive force that would carry out anti terrorist operations outside of the formal state gambit.\n\nWhile attempting to rescue a fellow Indian security agent in Turkey, Ajay Singh Rajput (Akshay Kumar) captures a traitor to the Indian government, Jamal, who formerly worked under Ajay. Ajay captures Jamal and threatens to kill his family unless he gives them information about the terror attack plans on India. He discovers a terrorist plot to cause a bomb blast in a Delhi mall which he and Jai (Rana Daggubati) are able to prevent. In the process they learn that this was only the first in a series of massive attacks that have been planned. Terrorist mastermind Maulana (Rasheed Naz), who is causing trouble near the Pakistan-India border, arranges for Bilal (Kay Kay Menon) to escape from prison, when he is returning from trial at a TADA court in Mumbai. Maulana is the ring leader & financier of terrorist activities in the region & has a $ 10 MM bounty on his head. Maulana needs Bilal as Bilal is the key to the further blasts in India, & Bilal is refusing to share any information with Maulana about his assets, till Maulana gets him out of jail.\n\nAfter Bilal's escape, a Muslim college student approaches the Indian Inteligence & is interrogated by Ajay. He divulges details on Taufeeq, who is a local religious leader, who recruits for Maulana & provide training for these recruits in Nepal. The student, Aftab, explains that he saw Taufeeq with a picture of Bilal & just yesterday a few men from Pakistan arrived with Taufeeq, including known terrorist Javed Khan.\n\nA team from Baby is dispatched to apprehend Taufeeq, who is surreptitiously an aide to a terrorist organization and manage to get information on Javed Khan (who Taufeeq says knows the location of Bilal) after torturing him. They go to their hideout, but things go wrong and all of the squad members on the mission except Ajay are killed in an explosion, along with Javed Khan. By analyzing Javed's laptop, the baby team gets the location of terrorist trainer Wasim Khan, who was in constant touch with Javed & Bilal to plan some big explosions in India.

Ajay and Jai crack into Bilal's room with the help of Shukla and manage to kill Bilal. As they are about to return, they find that Maulana is also at the site. Jai knocks him out and they decide to bring Maulana back to India, sedated, under the pretext that he is a relative they need to get to India for a liver transplant. They manage to get a visa from the local authorities for Maulana (being shown as Ashfaq's ill uncle) with Ashfaq's help. Soon after, the hotel security discover the corpse of Bilal. The Arab police authorities put the police chief Hani Mohammad (Hasan Noman) in charge of investigating the crime. He attempts to track down the murderers quickly and eventually succeeds.

    "Baby Driver": "When Baby (Ansel Elgort) was a child, a car accident killed his parents and left him with tinnitus (continuos humming sounds in the ears), which he blocks out by listening to music on iPods. As a teen, Baby lived a troubled life and it is revealed that he once tried to steal a car which was, unknown to him, owned by criminal mastermind \"Doc\" (Kevin Spacey). Baby was caught by Doc himself but instead being turned in, he was coerced to work for Doc to pay off the debt. As a result, he became a getaway driver and ferried crews of robbers assembled by Doc. Between jobs, he creates remixes from snippets of conversations he records, and cares for his deaf foster father Joseph (CJ Jones). At a diner, he meets a waitress, Debora (Lily James), and they start dating.\n\nBaby's supposedly final job for Doc goes awry after the trigger-happy Bats (Jamie Foxx), who developed an immediate dislike to Baby, shoots a security guard. It becomes worse when an armed bystander chases them down, but Baby evades him and the police. Having paid his debt, Baby quits his life of crime. Joseph persuades him to start fresh and become a pizza delivery driver while Baby continues to date Deborah. However, while Baby is on a fancy dinner date with Debora, Doc appears and insists that he join another heist's crew, threatening to hurt Debora if he refuses. Baby reluctantly agrees.\n\nThe next heist targets money orders from a post office. When Baby arrives at their hideout, he is surprised that this job's crew consists of the easy-going Buddy (Jon Hamm), his sharpshooter wife Darling (Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez), and Bats; all repeat members, which is highly irregular, because Doc refuses to work with the same team more than once. While the crew attempts to purchase illegal arms for the job, Bats realizes the dealers are police and opens fire, presumably killing them all. Afterwards, Bats forces Baby to stop at Debora's diner, unaware of Baby and Debora's romance, and nearly kills her in a hold-up.\n\nDoc, furious at the botched deal, tries to cancel the heist, but Baby convinces him to go through with it. He attempts to flee later that night, hoping to take Debora and leave Atlanta. He is stopped by Buddy and Bats, who have discovered his recordings and suspect that Baby is an informant. However, Baby is able to prove his innocence when Doc and the rest of the crew play mix-tapes he has created. During the heist, Bats kills a security guard. Disgusted, Baby refuses to drive the crew, causing Bats to hit him. Baby rams the car into re-bar, impaling and killing Bats. The three surviving crew members flee on foot while the police chase them. After an ensuing firefight, Darling is shot and killed. Buddy blames Baby for her death, and vows to kill him. Baby steals another car and flees to his apartment to evacuate Joseph. Baby leaves Joseph, and his earnings from all his heists, on the porch of a senior care home along with a recording asking the staff to care for Joseph. Baby drives to Debora's diner to pick her up, where he discovers Buddy waiting. Baby shoots Buddy and flees with Debora as the police close in.\n\nBaby seeks help from Doc, who initially refuses, blaming Baby for ruining the heist. After seeing he truly loves Debora, Doc supplies them with cash and directions to get out of the country, stating that he was also in love once. Buddy ambushes them in the parking garage and rams Doc with a stolen police car, killing him. A cat-and-mouse game ensues, leading them in a multi-story parking garage. Buddy corners Baby, and fires his gun next to both of Baby's ears, temporarily deafening him. Debora disarms Buddy with a crowbar and Baby shoots him, causing him to fall to his death.\n\nFleeing Atlanta, Baby and Debora run into a police roadblock. Debora prepares to ram it, but Baby stops her and surrenders, telling her she does not belong in the world of crime. At Baby's trial, Joseph, Debora, and several people Baby saved during the robberies testify in his defense. Baby is sentenced to 25 years in prison, with a parole hearing after 5 years served. He receives postcards from Debora, who promises to wait for him. Baby is released afterwards and finds Debora waiting in the same fashion he had previously dreamed of, and they kiss."

    "Babylon A.D.": "A few decades in the future, a mercenary named Toorop (Vin Diesel) accepts a contract from a Russian mobster, Gorsky, who instructs him to take a young woman only known as Aurora (M\u00e9lanie Thierry) to New York. In order to reach his goal, Gorsky gave Toorop a variety of weapons as well as a UN passport that has to be injected under the skin of the neck. Toorop, along with the girl and her guardian nun Sister Rebeka (Michelle Yeoh), travel from the Noelite Convent in Mongolia where they lived across Russia to reach America.\n\nThe towns and cities of Russia have been turned into dangerous, over populated slums by war and terrorist activity, forcing Toorop, Aurora, and Rebeka to face dangers of the human element, all the while fleeing from an unknown group of mercenaries claiming to have been sent by Aurora's supposedly dead father. The stress of humanity's situation causes Aurora to act in strange ways that neither Toorop, nor Rebeka can explain. On one such occasion, Aurora seemed, for no reason, to panic and run from a crowded train station, just before it was bombed.\n\nLater, they were forced to board a submarine that carried refugees to Canada. There were too many refugees to take at once, so the submarine was forced to leave some behind, even if it came to shooting them. Aurora, infuriated by the loss of life, suddenly knew how to operate the thirty year old submarine, without having ever learned about it. However, her attempt to save those left behind was unsuccessful.\n\nOn the submarine journey, whilst Aurora sleeps, Sister Rebeka explains that Aurora could speak nineteen different languages by the age of two, and always seemed to know things she had never learned. Then, three months before leaving with Toorop, she had begun acting in ways she never had before. This occurred after a visit by a Noelite doctor who had administered a pill to Aurora. The doctor told her to go to America, and arranged for Toorop to take them.\n\nOnce in New York, a news broadcast about the bombing of the Convent that Aurora and Rebeka hail from, caused the group to realize that there was more going on then they knew. Gorsky, working for the Noelites, had planted a tracking device in Toorop's passport, and then bombed the convent when he knew they were in America. The doctor who earlier saw Aurora in the convent then appears to examine her again. When he leaves, Aurora reveals (again without being told) that she is pregnant with twins, even though she was a virgin.\n\nLooking outside, Toorop sees both Gorsky's men and the Noelite group, heavily armed and waiting for them, all there to guarantee her delivery to the High Priestess. The High Priestess calls Toorop and asks him to bring Aurora outside. As they prepare to take her, Toorop changes his mind and attacks both groups with the goal of getting the two women to safety. However, because of the tracking devices, Gorsky's men can lock onto him with tracking rockets. Rebeka is shot and killed defending Aurora. A missile is launched at Toorop, homing in on the passport embedded in his neck. Aurora shoots Toorop saying the words \"I need you to live.\" As he falls, the rocket strikes, apparently killing them both.\n\nDr. Arthur Darquandier revives Toorop after he has been dead for two hours using advanced medical techniques, replacing parts of his right arm and his entire left leg with cybernetics. Darquandier explains that when Aurora was a fetus, he was asked by the Neolites to genetically enhance her by using a super computer to 'implant' superior intelligence in her brain. It is also implied that the Noelite group had him create Aurora to become pregnant at a certain time in order to use her as a 'virgin birth' to help legitimize their religion.\n\nAfter she was born, the Noelites had him assassinated, or so they thought. He remained 'dead' until he found his daughter in Russia with Toorop.\n\nDoctor Darquandier helps Toorop access his final memories before death, where he hears Aurora instruct him to \"Go Home\". Doctor Darquandier instructs Toorop and to take some of his men to find Aurora before the Noelites do.\n\nToorop told Aurora the address of a property that his family owned north of New York and heads there. The High Priestess of the Noelites visits Darquandier, her ex-husband, to ask where Aurora is. When he refuses to tell she kills him, and dispatches her soldiers to find her.\n\nThe Noelites troops track Toorop down just after they find Aurora. The Neolites chase and shoot at Aurora and her protectors. Only Toorop, Aurora and a driver survive.\n\nToorop takes Aurora to a safe place where she gives birth to the twins, and just before she dies during childbirth, she tells Toorop that he is the father of her children. Toorop raises the two children, who are of two different races."

    "Bachchhan Paandey": "Myra Devekar (Kriti Sanon), is a budding director Under the guidance of film director (Nasir Abdullah). Myra is innovative and saves money on shoots by finding simple solutions, but the director feels she undermines his authority. Her father (Surendra Singh) is a spot boy on the sets and is treated very badly by the other members of the crew. But her dad encourages her to earn her respect in life. Myra wants to direct a biopic on social activist Lodha Patkar. But, She is given a task by a producer Vermaji (Ashwin Mushran) to come up with a gripping and violent gangster story to produce a film. To satisfy the producer's commercial outlook and her hunger for making a realistic flick, she decides to study the life of a real-life gangster for the script. Her extensive research leads to menacing one-eyed Bachchhan Paandey (Akshay Kumar) of Baagwa, a ruthless gangster surrounded by quirky yet scary henchmen.\n\nMyra travels to Baagwa where she meets her friend Vishu (Arshad Warsi) and tells him about her film idea on Bachchhan Paandey. Vishu gets furious and asks her to leave but is later persuaded to help her with the film. Myra offers him the role of a 2nd hero, which was the life long dream of even Vishu's father. without any headway, Myra gets lucky when Bachchhan and his entourage run into her at a local mechanic shop. Bachchhan makes it clear that he is not into idle talk and hates anyone who makes fun of him, as his business runs on fear. Both Vishu and Myra start to target Bachchhan Paandey's henchmen in an effort to get closer to him.\n\nKaandi (Saharsh Kumar Shukla) is a lightweight, with a heavy hand, and watches cheap porn. Bufferiya Chacha (Sanjay Mishra), is a trustworthy man for Bachchhan and runs the Kala theatre. He stutters. Pendulum (Abhimanyu Singh) drinks a lot & is in love with Pinky (Aroosa Khan). Pinky is the sister of 7 cops. Pinky is engaged to Police SP Suryakant Mishra (Santosh Shukla). Suryakant and Pinky's wedding took place, but Bachchhan intervened and Pinky got the courage to defy her family and elope with Pendulum.\n\nBufferiya says that he exposed the previous journo who came to ask for Bachchhan, so Vishnu and Myra rule him out. They supply German porn to Kaandi, but accidentally the CD makes it way to the house, where the ladies watch it with kids. Kaandi is slapped by every lady in the house. There is an attempt on Bachchhan's life and Bufferiya believes that it was an inside job. Meanwhile Suryakant has vowed to mass encounter Bachchhan and his gang.\n\nMeanwhile Pendulum finds Vishnu trailing him and asks Virgin to Investigate Vishnu and Myra. Myra seduces Virgin by saying that he has a hero personality. He falls for it. Virgin (Prateik Babbar), tells them about Paandey's former girlfriend Sophie (Jacqueline Fernandez), who was killed by the former. Vishnu and Myra plant a microphone on Virgin to eavesdrop on his conversations with Paandey. Meanwhile Paandey has figured out that Rana Lohia planned the attack on him. Rana meets his girlfriend, without any security, in a colony and Paandey lies in wait with his men.\n\nLater, Virgin betrays Paandey (when Virgin calls Rana and tells him how Paandey is lying in wait for him) but is caught and killed by him. Vishu and Myra listen to the murder through the microphone, but are caught by Paandey's gang when they discover the mike planted by Myra in Virgin's phone. Paandey sets out to kill Vishnu and Myra, but agrees to spare them when he discovers that Myra is directing a gangster movie, under the condition that he plays the protagonist of the film. Vishnu was angry when he realizes that Myra was giving him only 2 scenes in her film and hence seeds the idea with Bachchhan that he should play the hero in his own biopic. This is only to make things more difficult for Myra.\n\nMyra initially doesn't accept & tries to run away from the town, but Kaandi and Pendulum tracks her to the bus station and Myra is forced to listen to Paandey's backstory. Paandey lives with his mother (Seema Biswas). She hasn't spoken to Paandey for 10 yrs for his criminal life. Paandey allows Myra to make films of his daily life, his tortures, murders and extortion. He has killed 70 people to date.\n\nIn a flashback, Paandey works for a politician Lalji Bhagat (Mohan Agashe). Sophie is a foreigner who has come to visit the village fair. Paandey falls in love with her and spends time with her. Sophie's parents had met in Pushkar and she asks Paandey to help her do all the things that her parents did when they fell in love. After a fallout (Paandey asks Lalji to release him from bondage, so he can settle down and have a family life), Lalji gets Paandey's former girlfriend Sophie killed (and Paandey's eye is stabbed in the process). In retaliation, Paandey murders the politician in the hospital.\n\nBachchhan Paandey and his goons don't know how to do acting, so they learn through Bhavesh Bhoplo (Pankaj Tripathi), an acting coach. Bhavesh doesn't know that Paandey and his men are dreaded goons. So, Bhavesh hits, threatens, and humiliates Paandey and his henchmen, much to their chagrin. Nevertheless, Myra dissuades them from harming Bhavesh for the sake of the movie.\n\nThe film is eventually completed and released in the theaters. Bachchhan Paandey and goons initially get excited and promote the film named \"BP,\" thinking it to be the gritty gangster drama that it was marketed as. To their horror, the film turns out to be a comedy that portrays them negatively (BP stands for Bhola Paandey). On the other hand, Myra's film is proved to be a hit and gets praise from her media and her director who used to often criticize her a lot. Myra's dad gets the respect he always craved. Bachchhan Paandey and goons decide to kill her for making his fear in people vanish.\n\nPaandey and his goons pour petrol on Myra and are about to set her alight, when Paandey narrates that when another big don of their area died, nobody came to his funeral. He had fear, but no respect in people. Virgin's wife walks up to Paandey and thanks him for the film that made her daughter laugh for the first time after her father's death. The little girl who was scared of Paandey, now hugs him. His movie is running house full in all theaters. His mom speaks to him for the first time in 10 yrs. She credits Myra for showing everyone a side of Paandey that no one had seen before. Paandey spares Myra.\n\nBachchhan Paandey, later on, becomes a star, and Kaandi gives up his habit of watching porn films. Bhavesh Bhoplo becomes the best acting teacher and Bachchhan Paandey gets recognized as a best comedy actor with Myra as best director."

    "Back to Bataan": "On January 30, 1945, the United States Army frees the prisoners in a daring raid being held by the Japanese at the Cabanatuan camp in the Philippines.\n\nThe groundwork for that liberation began years earlier in March 1942 when Colonel Joe Madden (John Wayne), an American army officer who possesses a strong bond to the Philippine people and a commitment to maintain their independence, is assigned to organize a band of guerrillas to resist the encroaching Japanese army. Before leaving his troops, Madden puts Captain Andr\u00e9s Bonif\u00e1cio (Anthony Quinn), the grandson of a venerated Philippine leader, in charge of his company of troops. Bonifacio is despondent because his former sweetheart, Dalisay Delgado (Fely Franquelli), now works as a spokesperson for the Japanese and advocates Philippine surrender.\n\nAs Madden assembles his guerrilla army in the jungle, the Japanese overrun a nearby village and close its school. When a Japanese captain orders Buenaventura Bello (Vladimir Sokoloff), the principal, to haul down the American flag, Bello refuses and is hung from the flag pole for his insubordination. Miss Bertha Barnes (Beulah Bondi), the middle-aged schoolteacher, flees into the jungle with her top student Maximo and a few other students and there meets Madden. Her words of inspiration and defiance inspire the guerrillas in their mission to blow up a gasoline dump at a Japanese airfield.\n\nLater on April 9, 1942, word comes of the fall of Bataan and capture of Bonifacio. Madden finds and frees the wounded Bonifacio during the Bataan \"Death March\", however, and Miss Barnes nurses him back to health. Madden and his men then liberate Maximo's village, and after executing the Japanese captain, they place an epitaph on Bello's grave. Although Bonifacio recovers from his wounds, his faith in the Philippine cause is not restored.\n\nMadden, aware that Dalisay is working undercover as a messenger in the Philippine independence movement, sends Bonifacio to Manila with a message. There, Bonifacio is surprised to discover that his contact is Dalisay. After she lectures him about the importance of resisting Japanese aggression, Bonifacio returns to the jungle and reluctantly agrees to rejoin the fight until he can leave the country with Dalisay.\n\nOver the next several months, as Madden and his machete-wielding army recapture Japanese-held villages, Major Hasko (Richard Loo), one of the Japanese commanders, decides to mollify the Philippine people by staging an elaborate ceremony to declare their independence. Madden and his men plan to sabotage the ceremony, and Maximo begs to join them in the attack. Madden refuses but, after giving the boy his colonel's eagle as consolation, orders him to take charge of the other children. As the Japanese begin to broadcast the ceremony, Madden and his men attack and Dalisay denounces the Japanese invaders. After Bonifacio rescues her from the stage, they all retreat into the jungle. Maximo prepares to flee, but is captured by Japanese soldiers and beaten until he agrees to lead them to the guerrilla headquarters. As the boy and his captors drive along a mountain road, Maximo grabs the steering wheel and sends the vehicle plunging from a cliff. Witnessing the accident, Madden and his men rush to the truck, killing Hasko and the wounded Japanese troops in the wrecked truck. However, the wounded Maximo soon dies in the arms of Miss Barnes.\n\nOrdered to forge ahead, Madden puts Bonifacio in charge of the guerrillas and departs from the Philippines. Skipping forward several months later in October 1944, the guerrillas are buoyed by word that the \"Yanks\" are landing. After making their way to the beach at Leyte, Bonifacio, who still lacks faith, is amazed to find the beach filled with people awaiting the arrival of an American submarine delivering guns. The appearance of the submarine restores Bonifacio's conviction, and he vows to fight until the end. The submarine also brings Madden and Lt. Commander Waite (Lawrence Tierney) a U.S. Navy officer, who announces that General MacArthur plans to land American troops on the beach at Leyte on October 20. Waite tasks Bonifacio and Madden with a mission of taking and holding a small village to block Japanese reinforcements from repelling the impending landing of American forces that are due within 24 hours.\n\nAssigned to block the road from Japanese troops until the beachhead is secured, Madden and his men hide underneath the water in a rice paddy near Japanese headquarters, using reeds to breath. At the proper moment, they spring to the surface to attack. Two enemy soldiers, however, get away on a motorcycle and spread the alarm. Japanese tanks and soldiers attack. The defenders manage to knock out most of the tanks, but are on the verge of being forced to retreat. Just when all seems lost, American reinforcements and tanks arrive and turn the tide of battle. With the defeat of the Japanese, the American flag is hoisted back up the flagpole while Madden, Bonifacio, Dalisay and Miss Barnes celebrate, and the Philippine people achieve their hard-won freedom.\n\nThe film ends with another short montage, this time showing several of the actual released Americans from the Cabanatuan prison camp."

    "Bad Ass": "--written by KrystelClaire\n\nThe film starts with photos and shorts of the Latin quarters. There are buses, plenty of grafitti, highways in the middle of the city of LA. Some of the shots have been taken from YouView, which works, obviously, the same as YouTube.\n\nFrank Vega (Shalim Ortiz) is travelling by bus, and two punks get in. He starts remembering his teenage years, saying that they were the simplest and the happiest. He was the son of some small local farmers, and had a beautiful girlfriend called Lindsay (Jillian Murray). He has to do something with his life, so he decides to join the Army, and ends up being tortured and wounded in Viet Nam. When he returns to the USA, he has to follow rehabilitation, and then he tries to come back to his life.\n\nHowever, when he visits adult Lindsay (Donzaleigh Abernathy), she is already married with two children. He tries to join the police forces, but his wonds cause him to be rejected. He can't find a decent job, as all the possible employees want university degrees and experience. Finally, he starts selling hot dogs in a street post. And 40 years have gone by, and Frank (Danny Trejo)'s life has slipped through his fingers.\n\nHe repents about his life. When two punks enter the bus, they bother a passenger. Frank tells them to stop, so he becomes the object of their wrath, but he defends himself and ends up beating them to a pulp. Some other passengers record this with their mobile phones, and they upload it onto YouView with the title Bad Ass. Frank becomes an instant celebrity, and he and Mrs Vega (Tonita Castro) are interviewed at the morning programme LA Mornings by a journalist (Sam Rubin). Now, his community and the police respect him. Officer Marlak (Patrick Fabian) even takes with them on patrol.\n\nThree months later, Frank's mother dies. Father Miller (Richard Riehle) gives out a deep and nice speech, but Frank is sad anyway. He takes all the cutlery to their local church, as stated in her will. The rest will be for him.\n\nOn TV, Mayor Williams (Ron Perlman) wants to improve the safety of the Latin quarters.\n\nHe is about to move in with his best friend in Mrs Vega's home. During the moving, they stop to drink Mrs Vega's drinks and they reminiscence about the old times in Nam, how Klondike Washington (Harrison Page) saved Frank's life, and they talk about the best day of their lives, which is yet to come. Klondike also gives Frank a pen drive, saying that it's important for Frank to keep it in Mrs Vega's old safe. Klondike mentions a plan to become rich.\n\nKlodike goes out to buy more liquor, and two punks threaten him. They are looking for something, which he says he doesn't have. It looks as though Klodike has won the fight. However, the guy called Sebastian (Craig Johnson) shoots Klodike and kills him. He and the other (Dorian Kingi) run away.\n\nFrank beats the crap of three punks at a liquor shop, so that the clerk (Ezra Buzzington) gives him the things he didn't have money to pay.\n\nA neighbour lady called Amber Lamps (Joyful Drake) offers him some consolation, stating that it's impossible to live on the neighbourhood anymore.\n\nFrank decides not to go out with his cop friend, and thinks that Detective Shah (Frank Maharajh) is not doing anything to investigate Klondike's death because he was black. He watches TV, and a news anchour (Christine Clayburg) says that 20 detectives were implied in the investigation of a person's runover. Frank feels frustrated when he sees some detectives playing games instead of working, so he decides to take things in his own hands. In fact, he goes to the place of the fight and finds one strange cartridge and a necklace with a photograph inside. He has a conversation with a boy but his father (Chris Spencer) tells the boy not to talk with unknown people and neighbours.\n\nIt is a hunter weapon, a Baretta, something designed for the government and its army. The gun shop says that the girl in the photo looks like a girl who usually attends his church. He visits that lady, who is fed-up with the man who supposedly lost her necklace at Frank's, called Terrance (Erik Betts). She tells him that he's been away for a week, probably playing ball with his friends. At 22nd Street park, Terrance's friends (Joe Holiday, Buddy Sosthand & Mark Rhino Smith) are beaten until they tell Frank to look for Renaldo (Andy Davoli).\n\nHe visits Renaldo's apartment, and a man dressed as a Catholic priest (Jack Freshkin) thinks that he was going to rob them, so he attacks them.\n\nWilliams talks to Panther (Charles S. Dutton), the former's contact on the streets. Williams is facing re-ellection in 90 days, and it all depends in finding that pen-drive. Williams is afraid of Frank. Panther says that the streets are his, and that he'll take care of Bad Ass, because his brothers dealth with Klonkike in the wrong way.\n\nFrank helps an elderly lady (Norma Michaels) with her bags, and somebody shoots him. Frank still talks to Martin (John Duffy) the cutely savvy son of his neigbhbour, who has put violent Terrance out after he has hit her.\n\nFrank questions about Renaldo in a bar, starting a bar prawl, who he wins. The bartender (Tommy Rosales) tells him that Renaldo is upstairs. A pimp tells that Renaldo is with Tatiana (Winter Ave Zoli). At Mrs Vega's, a thug asks Frank about a pen drive. Frank tells Martin to use it, and that's how they see all the plans for the regentrification of the whole neighbourhood.\n\nFrank goes to Tatiana's massage parlour. Tatiana is a blonde masseuse who says she has split up with Reanldo and leaves Frank.\n\nLooking for Renaldo, a Bad-Ass fan (Esteban Cueto) neighbour tells him to burglar it in; in fact, he tells him that Tatiana always leaves her back door open. Tatiana and Renaldo are at it. Frank takes Renaldo's hand through the rabbish disposal system, and cuts several fingers. He says that Sebastian killed Klondike, and that Buster was the one who called the shots. On leaving, all the kitchen stained with blood, Frank says that Renaldo's wife sends a message: \"Fuck You\".\n\nFrank defends Martin's mother from Martin Sr., who's hitting her. Frank gets all cute to have dinner with her at her garden, which reminds Frank of his own mother.\n\nFrank gives to his friend Officer Malark the pen - just in case something bad happens to him. Frank goes to confess, because he's looking for revenge.\n\nFrank goes to Panther's garage directly. Two thugs are there, but Panther decides to face him directly, but not on his own. Panther tortures Frank with electricity, the same kind of torture that he had to face in Nam. Panther finds a photograph of Amber at Frank's wallet, so he threatens him with him going to attack her. As soon as Panther leaves, Frank releases himself with a lighter - in a cheese moment, in my opinion - and then there's this huge fight. Fire is everywhere, and then everything blows up.\n\nPanther runs away and takes a bus from a driver (Robert Sean Burke). When Frank tells a bus driver (Craig Moss) that he needs to steal his bus, the driver happens to be a fan of Frank's, so he will let him take his bus happily. Frank runs after the bus,creating havoc and chaos on their way, until Frank bumps onto a building. Panther decides to meet Frank face to face at the LA Market premises. On the last second, Frank swerves, but Panther's bus is crashed by an incoming train.\n\nOf course, this doesn't stop either of them. They both reach Amber's at the same time, and they fist-fight. Panther wonders how Frank Vega was able to find such a sexy lady. Amber takes Frank's side, obviously, but is Frank Vega who gives Panther the final punches. Frank says that he never had a woman rescuing him. She is worried because Frank's got a black eye and is bleeding. She takes Frank inside to take care of him, while Panther is left on his own, thrown to the soil, with a bleeding face, in the outside garden yard.\n\nA journalist says that the audience may remember Frank Vega \"Bad Ass\", but that he uncovered a major political corruption case, which meant that the mayor's office was linked to a terrorizing streetgang. The mayor is seen alleging that he's being attacked by special terrorist groups which are trying to destroy his political and economic agenda for the city.\n\nFrank is named an honorary police officer, and Malark gives him his badge. Frank goes speechless.\n\nAmber and her son dine together with Frank. Frank says that that was the best day of his life. The son tells him to trim that damn beard."

    "Bad Boys": "Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) are best friends and detectives in the narcotics division of the Miami-Dade Police Department. One night, $100 million of seized heroin is stolen from a secure police vault. This is a major blow to Burnett and Lowrey, because it was the biggest drug bust of their careers. Internal Affairs warns Miami PD that if they do not recover the drugs in five days the narcotics division will be shut down.\n\nOne thief, a former cop named Eddie Dom\u00ednguez, is found dead at a hotel suite, shot to death by his boss, French drug kingpin Fouchet. Fouchet also kills an escort, Maxine \"Max\" Logan, who was hired by Eddie. It is revealed that she is also one of Lowrey's ex-girlfriends and one of his major informants. The only witness to the crime is Max's best friend Julie Mott (T\u00e9a Leoni), who watched the crime from the upper balcony of the suite.\n\nAlthough she has not met Mike, because of Max's relationship with him Julie will only trust and deal with Lowrey. However, he is away when she contacts the police about the murders, threatening to run if she does not speak to Mike. Captain Conrad Howard (Joe Pantoliano) forces Burnett to impersonate Lowrey to get Julie to cooperate. In order to continue the deception, Burnett and Lowrey switch lives. Burnett tells his family he is going to Cleveland for a case, leaving Mike to stay with them. Burnett then moves into Lowrey's apartment with Julie and her dogs. In Julie's presence, Burnett poses as Lowrey while Mike poses as Burnett.\n\nThe investigation proceeds with Lowrey and Burnett calling in on their old informants, including Jojo (Michael Imperioli), a former chemist who now works at a tire store. Later, Julie identifies one of Max's killers, Noah Trafficante, while looking through mug shots. The two cops then head off to Club Hell, one of his known hangouts. Unbeknownst to them, Julie has followed, eager to dish out revenge on Max's killers. Her presence alerts the criminals, resulting in Noah fleeing. After a brief fight and car chase, Noah is killed. The incident is caught on camera by a news helicopter. The subsequent report is later seen by Burnett's family.\n\nLowrey and Burnett decide to visit Jojo again. After an aggressive and convincing good cop-bad cop act from Lowrey and Burnett, Jojo tells them the location of the chemist who is cutting the stolen drugs. After staking out his house, they follow him to where Fouchet is hiding the drugs. They return to Mike's apartment with Julie, where they are confronted by Marcus' wife who blows their cover, causing Julie to try to run. Fouchet and his gang arrive at Lowrey's apartment and kidnap Julie. Because of this, Internal Affairs reassigns all members of the narcotics division, effectively shutting them down, but Captain Howard delays the order to give Lowrey and Burnett a chance to get Julie and the drugs back.\n\nBurnett, Lowrey and two other members of the Miami P.D. (Sanchez and Ruiz) organize a plan to stop the criminals from killing Julie and selling the drugs. A final shoot-out erupts between the group of cops and the drug dealers at an abandoned air field. Burnett is shot in the leg after saving Julie from Fouchet. Fouchet also shoots Lowrey while escaping the building, which is now on fire, but he is rescued by Burnett and Julie who left to get Lowrey's car.\n\nThe cops and Julie chase Fouchet's Shelby Cobra AC 427 in Mike's Porsche 911 Turbo. After Burnett bumps him off the road, Fouchet crashes but manages to escape the wreckage. Attempting to run, Fouchet is shot in the leg by Lowrey. Fouchet, knowing he is beaten, tries to goad Lowrey into killing him, which he almost does as revenge for Max's murder, until Burnett prevents it. While on the ground Fouchet then pulls out a concealed weapon and aims at Burnett, but seeing the reflection on his partner's forehead, Lowrey spins and shoots Fouchet numerous times, killing him.\n\nLater, after Marcus and Mike profess their mutual platonic love for one another and their relief in surviving the gun fight, Marcus handcuffs Julie and Mike's hands together and hobbles away hoping for some much needed \"quality time\" with his wife. Julie and Mike wonder if he has the keys to the handcuffs."

    "Bad Boys II": "Eight years after the events of the first film, Miami police detectives Marcus Barnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) are investigating the flow of highly-potent ecstasy into the city. Their surveillance of boats coming in from Cuba leads them to a Ku Klux Klan meeting and drug drop in a swamp. The subsequent raid on the Klan members proves to be a disaster; malfunctioning radios delay back-up, causing a firefight where Mike accidentally shoots Marcus in the buttocks, while the Klan members are revealed to be mere small-time buyers and not the distributors of the ecstasy. The incident leaves Marcus to further question if he still wants to partner with Mike, while Mike frets that Marcus may discover his relationship with Marcus' sister, Syd (Gabrielle Union).\n\nUnbeknownst to Mike and Marcus, Syd is an undercover operative with the DEA, as a money laundering agent for Russian gangsters; the Russian gangsters are in fact the distributors of the ecstasy on behalf of neurotic Cuban drug lord Johnny Tapia (Jordi Moll\u00e0). During her first assignment in Miami, a violent Haitian gang attempts to hijack the money transport between the Russians and Tapia, putting Syd in danger. Mike and Marcus inadvertently stumble into the action, and an intense fire fight and car chase ensues between the gang members and the Miami Police/DEA, devastating the local area and enraging Police Captain Conrad Howard (Joe Pantoliano). Marcus and Mike learn of Syd's actual work, which makes Marcus unhappy, while Capt. Howard demands they find the supplier of ecstasy.\n\nMarcus and Mike go to confront the Haitian gang leader, which results in a firefight and the leader revealing that his information about the transport came from his friend's camcorder. After viewing the footage, Marcus and Mike find out that a local business, the Spanish Palms Mortuary, is possibly being used as a front by Tapia. Disguised as pest terminators, the detectives penetrate Tapia's mansion and discover that Tapia has eliminated his Russian distributors and begun to woo their former associate Syd, who is still undercover with the DEA and has refocused the investigation towards Tapia. The detectives also recover evidence linking Tapia to one of the boats involved in the Klan raid.\n\nAfter pressuring one of the arrested Klansman into making Tapia's boat, the detectives find themselves involved in another firefight, this time while pursuing a morgue van from the docks carrying emptied cadavers. Mike and Marcus decide to infiltrate Tapia's mortuary, where they learn that the drug lord is using dead bodies to smuggle his drugs and money. The mission is nearly sabotaged when the pair are almost discovered, resulting in Marcus accidentally ingesting some of the ecstasy and Mike ordering the disguised officers outside the building to crash an ambulance into it, creating an diversion. After Mike and an intoxicated Marcus obtain a search warrant from Capt. Howard, the mortuary and Tapia's mansion are raided, with the drugs and money being intercepted by the Coast Guard. However, the mansion raid is botched when a vengeful Russian gangster, Alexei (Peter Stormare), violently storms the mansion on his own. Alexei is killed by the police, while Syd is discovered by Tapia and kidnapped to Cuba. With Syd held prisoner in Tapia's compound and guarded by the Cuban military, the drug lord demands the return of his money in two days in exchange for Syd's life.\n\nMike and Marcus, along with their voluntary SWAT team and Syd's DEA co-workers, prepare a military assault to rescue Syd from Tapia's fortress. During the battle, Mike and Marcus extract Syd and escape, pursued by the infuriated Tapia. After a lengthy pursuit, they end up in a minefield outside the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, where Tapia holds Mike at gunpoint. Marcus rescues Mike with a skillful head-shot to Tapia's skull in the middle of the minefield with his last bullet; in a nod to the previous film, Mike exclaims \"That's how you shoot!\". Later, at the Burnett house, Mike has bought Marcus a new pool (replacing a previous pool that had been destroyed in a prior gag), and Marcus finally makes peace with Mike dating Syd and no longer doubts their partnership. Despite the sentiment, Mike's new pool breaks, washing the two into a river, as they sing the \"Bad Boys\" theme song."

    "Bad Boys for Life": "This third 'Bad Boys' film starts with Detectives Mike Lowery (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) speeding through the streets of Miami with other cops following them. They arrive at a hospital and run inside as they head to the room where Marcus's daughter Megan (Bianca Bethune) has given birth to a baby boy. His wife Theresa (Therese Randle) and Megan's fiance Reggie (Dennis Greene) are there as well, informing Marcus that the boy is named after him. He proudly holds his grandson.\n\nIn a Mexican prison, inmate Isabel Aretas (Kate Del Castillo) is muttering an incantation that draws a guard's attention. Isabel grabs a knife off the guard and stabs her, with the other inmates jumping in and stabbing her to death. Other guards take Isabel outside, only for her son Armando (Jacob Scipio) to help her kill off all the other guards. He frees her, and they return to their home to plot revenge on behalf of her late husband Benito, with Mike being their intended final target.\n\nArmando goes to the docks to pull out a crate filled with money with intent to work with other gangsters, but these gangsters try to screw him over and take the majority shares of the money. With their guns drawn on Armando, he retaliates by stabbing everyone rapidly. He then orders the remaining men to step up if they wish to work loyally under his family. A crook named Lorenzo Rodriguez, AKA Zway-Lo (Nicky Jam), joins him.\n\nMike and Marcus's fellow officers, including Captain Howard (Joe Pantoliano), gather at a bar to celebrate Marcus becoming a grandfather. They encounter a woman named Rita (Paola Nunez), who has just been promoted to lieutenant and is also Mike's ex. She informs them that she is also now heading AMMO (Advanced Miami Metro Operations), which employs a younger team of officers. Marcus knows they are getting too old for all the crazy things they used to get into, and he urges Mike to settle down, though he disagrees. The two go outside to have a foot race, and as Mike takes the lead, Armando rides up on a motorcycle and shoots Mike down. He gets away as the officers rush to help Mike.\n\nMike is in critical condition. Marcus prays to God that Mike be saved, with the promise that Marcus will never bring anymore violence into the world. Rita and Howard then order AMMO - Kelly (Vanessa Hudgens), Dorn (Alexander Ludwig), and Rafe (Charles Melton) - to do what they can do investigate Mike's shooter. Meanwhile, Isabel chastises Armando for going after Mike so soon, as she deliberately wants him to die last so that he suffers watching others die. They proceed to go after a judge, a forensics analyst, and a prosecutor, killing them all in broad daylight.\n\nSix months later, Megan and Reggie get married, and Mike has recovered from his injuries. He delivers a speech at the wedding before later asking Marcus to help him catch the shooter, but Marcus refuses, fearing someone else will get hurt, and he insists that he is retired. After learning Mike is awake, Armando uploads his bodycam footage of him shooting Mike. He goes to Rita for help but is also met with the same refusal.\n\nMike takes it upon himself to find his shooter. He visits a retired criminal named Manny The Butcher (DJ Khaled) and beats his hand with a hammer until he gives up the name of a guy named Booker Grassie (Rory Markham), who would have info on the owner of the motorcycle, and therefore the shooter. Mike goes to Captain Howard, who begrudgingly has him go along with AMMO to find Grassie. Mike quickly butts heads with Rafe since he's a smart-ass, but Kelly and Dorn respect Mike's status as a detective.\n\nMike and the team go to a warehouse where Grassie is going to make a drop. Mike quickly catches that Grassie is trying to rip the guys off and will get himself killed. A shootout begins, and Mike tries to get Grassie out of there, but after fighting off the other thugs, Grassie is blown back by an explosion and is impaled by a forklift. He dies before Mike can get any info out of him.\n\nMarcus gets a call from a snitch named Carver Remy (Ivo Nandi), who claims that Armando is following him and trying to kill him. He asks Marcus for help, who then tries to contact Mike, but he ignores Marcus since he sees him as a quitter. Eventually, Mike picks up and joins Marcus in going to find Remy, but once they get to his hotel, Remy's body hits Marcus's (actually Theresa's) car. Mike runs into the hotel and fights Armando, managing to pull his mask off but finding himself stunned when he sees Armando's face. He manages to get away.\n\nMike later joins Howard at a game, where the two bond as Howard expresses his genuine concern and care for Mike. As they are leaving, a bullet strikes Howard in the throat. Armando and Zway-Lo are behind it, but since Mike knows he is in plain sight, he pulls Howard away and stays behind a car, giving Armando no clear shot. Mike tries to revive Howard, but he dies. After his funeral, Marcus officially decides to join Mike in catching the shooter.\n\nMike and Marcus go off to find a shady broker named Picante Jenkins (Happy Anderson) for a lead on their shooter. They enter Jenkins' motel room where he is coked out of his mind. Marcus tries to appeal to him on a personal level, but it only gets him punched hard. AMMO soon comes in, with Marcus having called them, and they tase Jenkins to the ground. After getting Jenkins' files, they recognize Zway-Lo and plan to track him next.\n\nThe team goes to a club where they find Zway-Lo. After attempting to arrest him, he runs for it, and the team must fight his goons. Mike and Marcus hop on a motorcycle and sidecar, with Marcus having to break his promise to God and use a machine gun to fight off the incoming thugs. They ride into the streets to pursue Zway-Lo, who then attempts to board a chopper ladder. Mike runs off and latches onto the ladder as well. Armando shoots Zway-Lo off to get a better shot at Mike. He tells him \"Hasta el fuego\" before Mike lets go and falls into the water.\n\nBack at headquarters, Mike has Dorn look up files based on the phrase Armando said. Mike realizes Isabel is behind all of this. He explains to Marcus that before they teamed up, he was deep undercover in the Aretas cartel and he had a relationship with Isabel before he had to throw her in jail and get her husband killed. \"Hasta el fuego\" was a phrase they came up with that was nonsensical but was supposed to mean \"Together until the flame burns out.\" She was also heavily into witchery, which gave her the nickname \"La Bruja\". Mike concludes that Armando is his son and that she has been grooming him for revenge, since all the victims were on the same case against the Aretas family. After realizing he knows the truth, Isabel contacts Mike and arranges for him to meet her in Mexico City to end things.\n\nThe team heads to Mexico for the final showdown, with Isabel ordering Mike to meet them in an old palace. They engage in a firefight against Isabel's mercenaries, with the AMMO officers proving their skills with guns, as well as physically in Dorn's case. Marcus then shoots down a sniper chopper, causing it to come crashing down to the building and starting a fire. Armando goes to fight Mike, but he decides to confront him as a person and reveal his parentage to Armando. He asks Isabel if it's true, and she admits that it is. She tries to shoot Mike, but Armando steps in the way and takes the bullet in the shoulder. Rita then shoots Isabel off the ledge to her death... sending her plummeting into the flaming wreckage. Marcus almost falls over too, but Armando helps Mike pull him up and get them out of there.\n\nLater on, the team is getting along better and they celebrate as Rita has been promoted to become the new captain. Mike and Marcus then bond with Baby Marcus, singing the \"Bad Boys\" song to him.\n\nBefore the credits roll, Mike visits Armando in prison, offering him a chance to make up for his crimes. Armando appears to be interested."

    "Bad Company": "When a mission to retrieve a stolen suitcase bomb goes bad, CIA agent Kevin Pope (Chris Rock) is killed. Pope was working undercover as an antiquities dealer under the name Michael Turner. The CIA, who is desperate to complete the mission discovers that Agent Pope had a twin brother, Jake Hayes (also Rock), from whom he was separated at birth; their mother died giving birth and Hayes suffered from a severe lung infection that prompted the doctors to separate them because they felt that Hayes was unlikely to live for very long. Hayes hustles chess games, scalps tickets and works at small clubs in Jersey City to make ends meet. Meanwhile Hayes's girlfriend, Julie (Washington) grows tired of waiting for him to grow up and decides to move to Seattle, Washington.\n\nAfter the CIA successfully persuades Hayes into participating and begins to train Hayes for a mission that is to take place in Prague (Czech Republic), they are initially dismayed by his lack of refinement. Agent Oakes (Anthony Hopkins) confronts Hayes telling him he doesn't trust him. When Hayes begins paying attention, the CIA sets him up in his brother's old apartment in Manhattan to test him and try to bait the men who killed his brother. Hayes is attacked, but escapes unharmed. Looking for a way out, Hayes goes to his foster mother only to be found by Oakes who persuades him to finish the mission.\n\nAfter arriving in Prague, Hayes meets with the men selling the suitcase bomb posing as his dead brother. The seller, Adrik Vas, is an ex-Russian Army Colonel with ties to the Russian Mafia. When they return to their hotel, Hayes is greeted by his brother's ex-girlfriend Nicole. Believing that Hayes is his brother the two have dinner and return to the hotel only to be ambushed by rival buyers. Nicole figures out Hayes isn't his brother and returns to her assignment covering the Balkans for CNN.\n\nMoving forward with the plans, Hayes and Oakes meet up with Adjanic and are able to steal the arming codes. Just as they close the deal, Vas' men double cross him with the rival buyer. When the rival dealers, who are part of a Greek terrorist organization, learn they can't detonate the bomb because of the missing codes, they kidnap Julie. Hayes gives himself up trying to save his girlfriend and the terrorists get the codes back and arm the bomb.\n\nNow the race begins to find Hayes and the bomb. After interrogating one of the captured terrorists, they track the bomb to Grand Central Station. With the clock ticking, they locate the bomb and Andre who has started the countdown. Oakes rescues Hayes by killing two terrorists. As Hayes starts to enter the codes to disarm the bomb, Andre holds Julie hostage. In order to distract Andre, Hayes pretends to shoot Oakes and they kill Andre by shooting him repeatedly. Hayes is able to disarm the bomb just prior to detonation.\n\nAt the ending of the film, Hayes visits the memorial for deceased secret agents to visit his brother's grave. Later on, Oakes comes up to Hayes at Hayes's wedding and warns him that a dangerous criminal has escaped from prison and is seeking revenge upon Kevin Pope, but since Kevin is dead and Hayes was impersonating him, the criminal thinks Hayes is Kevin. Hayes begins to panic and demand that Oakes has to protect him, but Oakes starts laughing as he reveals that it was just a joke and he really just came for the wedding."

    "Bad Guys": "Four people get out of a car and pile into a run-down warehouse. The leader and mastermind, certainly at least in her own opinion, is Zena (Kate Del Castillo), a street-smart defense lawyer; Detective Shepard (Art LaFleur), a hard-nosed cop; Eddie (Sherman Augustus), a slick, fast-talking con man and drug dealer; and Ashley (Danny Strong), a wimpy but talented chemist and medical school dropout who prepares 'designer' drugs for distribution.\n\nThe four of them spend the overwhelming majority of the movie harshly bickering and arguing. Ashley used his skills to prepare drugs for his dorm mates and was kicked out of medical school; Zena got both he and Eddie off. The four of them decided to make a big score in order to get a big payout that would let them live comfortably and thumb their noses at a society that they all feel, turned its collective back on them.\n\nAshley prepared a large quantity of a pure drug and they were making a sale to Roland Jackson (Quinton Jackson), a big, burly, black gangster who Eddie knows. Roland had 'gone Japanese,' and embraced Japanese culture after a visit to the country, and named himself 'The Big, Black Jap,' and his gang, the Black Yakuza. The deal went sour when Eddie inexplicably opened fire, killing Roland. Eddie fast-talks around the point when confronted on this in the warehouse, never quite explaining his motive. He does point out having been suspicious of an extra briefcase Roland had-- Eddie grabbed it as the four of them fled. All told, from the busted deal, they're now sitting on one million in cash-- an amount Zena is severely dissatisfied with, especially since it would be divided four ways. Shep wants to kill Eddie in the belief that he's a backstabber and untrustworthy, and Ashley's constant nervous jabber makes Shep want to kill him too. But Zena sternly tells him that they need to stick together and go according 'to plan;' a plan that Eddie continually ridicules. Their first order of business is to lay low and let the heat over Roland's murder blow over. Roland has a twin brother, Leroy Johnson (also played by Quinton Jackson in a dual role). Leroy is just as big, and just as mean as his brother, and although they're sworn enemies over Roland 'turning Japanese,' something Leroy finds repulsive, the four of them fear that Leroy will still seek retribution against Roland's killers.\n\nZena's clothes are covered in blood; it's revealed that after Eddie shot Roland, he was still alive, and leaped up and started to choke Zena. To save herself, she pulled her own gun and finished Roland off. The four of them had to take out all of Roland's men in a wild shootout from which they all escaped.\n\nThey watch a news report that shows that the police have no leads on Roland's killers. However, the report shows something very disturbing: one of Roland's men was actually an undercover DEA agent. Complicating matters further is that Shepard was the one who killed this man during the shootout. With no heat on the four of them, the plan is to continue laying low while Shepard and Eddie will make some calls to make sure no suspicion is drawing close, while Ashley will get to work in a makeshift drug preparation lab in the warehouse and perfect a new batch of a really pure and refined designer drug.\n\nAs Zena washes the blood off her blouse, Eddie quizzes her on something she doesn't want to talk about, and he makes it a sticking point throughout their share of the four-way bickering: Zena had had sex with Shepard. Eddie makes like he wants to have a go at Zena, who has an attractive body. Zena is rather disgusted by the idea. She later confides in Shep that she had sex with him because he was starting to come apart during the preparation of the deal with Roland, and it calmed him down and soothed his nerves.\n\nAshley and Eddie are talking in the lab, where Eddie reveals he doesn't do drugs himself, ever since he'd been too stoned to make a delivery one day; Eddie's kid brother took it on himself to make the delivery, and was killed.\n\nEddie visits a contact of his named Dutch (Michael Florie), who owns a strip joint. Word is that Leroy is heading to L.A. from his home turf in Detroit, after hearing of Roland's murder. Eddie plays dumb, acting like he hadn't heard about the 'hit' on Roland. They discuss a drug deal with Dutch being a sub-distributor.\n\nThe four of them are back at the warehouse, and they all jump as there is a banging knock at the door. Zena, Shepard and Eddie all stand to either side of the door, guns ready, until Ashley goes to the door and opens it. He'd gotten hungry and called for a pizza delivery, who's now staring down the barrels of three guns. The pizza guy (Ray Sefo) acts comically unruffled as they pull him into the warehouse and discuss what to do with him. Zena says they're going to pay him and let him go, so nobody goes looking for him. She gives him $100 and sends him on his way.\n\nMore backstory is revealed as during a routine round of bickering, Eddie reveals that he knows Shepard is the one who killed Eddie's brother. He'd caught Eddie's brother making the delivery, made him lie down on his belly with his hands over his head, divested the kid of all his stash, and then without any provocation, shot him in the head and murdered him.\n\nYet another serious snag further unravels the 'plan' as Ashley's two hamsters, which have been test subjects for the drugs he's preparing, are found dead in their cage. The latest batch he's whipped up is 100% fatal, making it unsuitable for sale. Everyone's nerves frays further; Shepard wanting to kill Ashley and Eddie more than ever, and Zena wanting to do it too but holding her desire for blood firmly in check. A very frightened Ashley promises to work out the problems.\n\nThe latest batch is ready, and Ashley has given some to a fluffy white rat named Winker. Winker has been busy on an exercise wheel for a couple of hours. They need a human test subject now as a final check before they're ready to sell and make their score.\n\nEddie brings a homeless, lifetime drug using bum named Flappy (Antonio Fargas) back to the warehouse. Flappy is so named because he dances on the street for pocket change. He's spent his whole life using a whole variety of drugs. He's offered to shoot the drug up, smoke it or snort it. Going really hardcore, Flappy asks to sprinkle some on cereal; a request Ashley finds very amusing.\n\nFlappy wolfs down two bowls of Froot Loops cereal sprinkled with the drug. He likes it has a lot of energy. Feeling like they're finally on the verge of their big score, Zena, Eddie, Shepard and Ashley sit down to eat the pizza. A comic bickering breaks out over what to name the drug, and during a lull, more backstory is revealed: Zena has been disbarred and no longer able to practice law. She explains this only as 'circumstances' and 'complications,' which infuriates Eddie, who sees both Zena and Shepard as self-righteous; Shepard is a long time dirty cop who sells most of the drugs he confiscates from dealers he arrests, but still feels he's doing right by society. Zena defends her being removed from the bar and her law license being revoked, while the two still see Eddie as just a common criminal with a penchant for B-movies. Zena and Shepard finally turn the tables on Eddie's continuous habit of using movie references against him, and they and Ashley all laugh hilariously.\n\nThe laughter stops very quickly as Flappy, who's been dancing in a corner while listening to music through headphones, suddenly collapses and falls dead. Desperate, Ashley tries to rationalize that Flappy is a lifetime user, he'd eaten the raw drug powder over two bowls of cereal, adding to which the warehouse isn't air conditioned and the standard hot weather of L.A. is making it sweltering; so it's a reasonable assumption that Flappy had a heart attack. He hurries to the lab to check on Winker.\n\nWinker is missing; Ashley accidentally left the door to his cage open. He states a need to find him, while Zena shouts that she needs to settle down and think.\n\nIt takes Zena very little time to notice that she's unable to focus and concentrate, despite her strongest effort. She confronts Ashley on this, who, under duress, reveals that he, motivated by Flappy's consumption of the drug... sprinkled it all over the pizza they'd all eaten.\n\nEddie immediately pulls his gun and kills Ashley. As Zena stands over the body, looking subdued and not upset over it, she happens to turn and sees Shepard is gone. Hurrying after him, she sees the briefcases with all the money gone. Shepard confronts them with his gun ready. He definitely wants to kill Eddie, and even Zena has to plead and use some of her feminine charm to make him think twice about killing her. One million split two ways isn't as much as one of them keeping it all, but Shepard has enough of a torch left to think about it. But his rage at Eddie is coming to a head. Eddie has no room nor time to raise his gun, but during a moment of distraction, he's able to slip a makeshift knife out of his sleeve and hurl it at Shepard. The knife hits him right in the throat, and Shepard slowly sags to the ground and dies in a pool of blood.\n\nFinally, it's Zena ready to turn on Eddie, although she's willing, if barely, to let Eddie go with all of the original opium while she takes the money. During the argument, Eddie tells Zena that he sees through her facade of acting sophisticated and 'uptown,' dressing in fancy clothes, talking with a big vocabulary, all of which clash from her inner-city upbringing. He doesn't believe that Zena lost her law license on a frame job.\n\nZena finally admits she wasn't framed, but she was duped; as an intern in a large law firm, she tried to be a team player and always please her superiors, all her efforts going without acknowledgment... until finally they came to her for help with something. Zena immediately knew it was drug money, but against her instincts, she helped launder it for them in the hopes it would get her some recognition. She's very angry and bitter at her own foolishness and blindness in not seeing the firm's real reason for giving her this job: so they could dump it all in her lap and make her a patsy to take the fall if the DEA caught on to them; which, of course, they did, and the firm gleefully handed Zena over to fry for them. This is what got Zena started on the whole scheme to make a drug score.\n\nZena gets a little emotional as she says she never wanted to hurt anyone, even Eddie. Eddie quietly says, \"Don't...\" but then out of simple contempt for her, he calls her a bitch; something he's done repeatedly throughout the movie just to rub it in her face after she made clear how much she hates being called that.\n\nFinally losing her temper, Zena pulls the trigger to kill Eddie, but finds the gun doesn't fire. Eddie had gummed up the gun's hammer and firing pin with chewing gum (he'd been seen taking a piece out of his mouth and putting it back in a wrapper at the beginning of the movie). Eddie gloats and makes fun of Zena, further rubbing it in with more B-movie references. At the end of her patience, Zena rips her skirt and challenges Eddie to a fist fight; intent on beating him to death with her bare hands. Eddie obliges her, and they fight it out in a brutal knockdown, dragout brawl. Although Eddie is stunned several times by Zena's ferocity, he gradually overpowers her, bloodying her nose and face with two vicious haymaker punches, before leaving her crumpled on the ground and gasping for air after a crippling punch to her stomach.\n\nThinking Zena is at his mercy, Eddie starts to grandstand and gesticulate, giggling hysterically several times. Seeing Zena trying to worm her way over to Eddie's gun, which had been knocked to the floor during the fight, he kicks it away and delivers more histrionics, gloating and rubbing it in.\n\nBut Zena has the last laugh when Eddie doesn't pay attention to her crawling over to Shepard's corpse. Grabbing Eddie's knife out of Shepard's throat, she throws it with all her remaining strength, burying it right in Eddie's heart. Eddie is now scolding himself, although the drug's taking effect makes him laugh it all off, and he literally dies laughing... at Zena, at himself, at everything and nothing.\n\nSeeing the TV still playing, Zena struggles to reach the remote, and turns the mute for the volume off so she can hear the newscast. The news reporters say that Leroy Johnson's men were involved in a shootout with police at L.A.'s airport, and Leroy is now the prime suspect in Roland's murder; the police knowing of the bad blood between the two brothers. Leroy has evaded arrest and capture but is now being hunted by police, the FBI, and the DEA, for the massacre that claimed the lives of Roland and his men, and the undercover DEA agent.\n\nZena grins wide at the irony of the news update, before she finally collapses over Shepard's body and dies. The last shot is of Winker, Ashley's rat, sitting at the edge of a batch of the designer drug Ashley had prepared; licking itself clean."

    "Bad Taste": "The New Zealand Astro Investigation and Defence Service (AIDS) sends Derek, Frank, Ozzy, and Barry to investigate the disappearance of everyone in the town of Kaihoro, North Island, New Zealand. They find the town has been overrun by space aliens disguised as humans. Barry kills one of the aliens and is attacked by others weilding sledge hammers. After Derek notifies Frank and Ozzy (whom are traveling on the road towards Kaihoro), he begins torturing Robert, an alien they captured earlier. Robert's screaming attracts a number of aliens in the area. Derek kills the would-be rescuers, but he is attacked by Robert and falls over a cliff, to his presumed death.\n\nMeanwhile, a charity bill collector named Giles is passing through Kaihoro. He is attacked by Robert, who has been eating the brains of the alien killed earlier by Barry. Giles escapes in his car and stops at a nearby house for help. Another alien (dressed as a chef) answers the door and captures Giles. He later wakes up in a tub of water and is told he is about to be eaten. Derek also wakes up to find that he landed in a seagull's nest. He also finds that his brain is leaking out the back of his head, so he stuffs it back in and uses a hat to hold it in place.\n\nThat night, Frank, Ozzy, and Barry sneak into the aliens' house and find a room filled with bloody cardboard boxes. They kidnap an alien and Frank wears its shirt to infiltrate an alien meeting. He finds out that the residents of Kaihoro have been harvested for alien fast food for this intergalatic fast food chain called 'Crum's Country Delights'. Robert vomits into a bowl, which the aliens dine on, including the disguised (and disgusted) Frank. He escapes and tells the team members of the plan. They sneak out to save Giles as the aliens sleep.\n\nAt sunrise, they try to leave but are attacked by the aliens. A long and climatic gun battle breaks out with dozens of ailens (wieling AK-47 assault rifles and various automatic weapons) battle the four humans. Derek joins in on the battle only to have his hat shot off, and he starts losing more of his brain, so he uses his belt as a headband. He grabs a chainsaw from the boot of his car and heads for the alien house. As the boys leave with Giles, the alien leader (Lord Crumb) and his followers transform into their true form and follow. Ozzy uses a rocket launcher to blow up Frank's car, which has been overrun by aliens.\n\nFrank and Ozzy hunt for Lord Crumb and kill a lot of more aliens along the way. Meanwhile, Derek kills an alien with his chainsaw and replaces the missing parts of his brain with alien brain. An alien prepares to shoot Frank and Ozzy, but it is beheaded by Derek after he bursts through the wall behind it. Frank and Ozzy are shocked to see him alive.\n\nAs they run, Lord Crumb shoots Ozzy in both of his legs and Frank fires his rocket launcher at the leader, but it misses and almost hits Derek, finally taking out a sheep in a nearby meadow. Derek is knocked out by the alien leader and the house transforms into a giant space ship, which blasts off into space with Derek still aboard.\n\nOn board, Derek looks out the window to see that he is leaving Earth. Lord Crumb hears a strange, loud noise and investigates. He is killed by Derek, who ambushes him and cuts the alien in half with his chainsaw. Derek proclaims into his phone: \"I'm born again! I'm coming to get you bastards!\" He then puts on the alien leader's skin, laughing maniacally as he rockets towards the alien planet where he will presumably kill the rest of the alien race (with just his one chainsaw).\n\nOn Earth in the final shot, Frank, Ozzy, Giles, and Barry drive away into the sunset in Derek's car."

    "Bade Miyan Chote Miyan": "An Indian convoy carrying a deadly weapon is ambushed and the soldiers guarding it are killed in the process. The perpetrator is a masked man who leaves a message for the Indian army telling them that he has stolen their weapon and they will have to race against time in order to prevent the destruction of India. Captain Misha meets an agent in Shanghai who warns her about the same before he gets killed by another masked attacker. Misha chases after him and gets into a fistfight, impaling him with a sharp weapon. However, the man's wounds heal instantly and he flees the scene. Misha reports to Colonel Azad and explains how the attacker's wounds healed magically. Azad tells her to keep it a secret and instructs her to enlist court martialed soldiers Firoz (Freddy) and Rakesh (Rocky) for the mission.\n\nMisha meets the duo and while Rocky agrees to accompany her, Freddy refuses, feeling that his job got him nothing but disrespect in the end. Misha and Rocky arrive in London and meet an IT Specialist named Parminder aka Pam, who is assigned to assist them in the mission. Azad also arrives in London, but gets shot by the masked villain. Meanwhile, the team infiltrate a London Subway in order to retrieve the stolen package. Just as the team is cornered and nearly defeated, Freddy arrives and fights off the masked men. Pam unlocks the vault and it is revealed that the package is actually a woman named Priya, who was once engaged to Freddy. Since the hard drives were at the risk of being hacked or falling into wrong hands, the codes to a highly advanced defense system named Karan Kavach were encrypted inside Priya's brain. However, the masked man and his army take Priya hostage and following a sustained chase, the group are cornered and the masked man reveals himself as Kabir, a former friend of the duo. He also reveals the nearly immortal masked men were none other than the duo's clones.\n\nIn a flashback, it is revealed that Kabir intended to help the Indian armed forces with the help of his latest invention: a cloning program where clones based on Freddy and Rocky's DNA could be programmed with orders by Azad and win wars without being killed. However, when he revealed his intentions to conquer the world using this invention, Azad reprimanded him in front of everyone and ordered him to shut down the program since it would go against ethics. Feeling betrayed, Kabir decided to switch sides and sell the invention to India's enemies. Priya alerted the team about the plan, and Freddy and Rocky were ordered to destroy the program and capture Kabir alive. However, they ended up killing him and were court-martialed for not following orders, after which Freddy broke off his engagement with Priya. However, Kabir reveals that he survived because it was actually his clone Eklavya, whom he loved like a son, that was killed and his death left Kabir traumatized and vengeful.\n\nBack to present, Kabir reveals that he has cloned Azad and kills the real one. He kidnaps Priya and leaves Freddy and Rocky to die. The duo manage to kill Kabir's henchmen and return to the base where they reveal to the team that since India has never initiated any of the wars it has participated in, Kabir plans to turn Pakistan and China against India by deactivating the Karan Kavach and launching airstrikes against the two countries, eventually causing India's reputation to be tarnished globally. Freddy, Rocky, Misha and Pam infiltrate Kabir's base where the latter decrypts the password from Priya's brain. Freddy and Rocky fight off Kabir's army, and eventually face off against their own clones, who keep rejuvenating due to an internal power source. Pam suggests destroying them using a high amount of electricity, and the duo kills all the clones by luring them into a power grid, causing them to explode. Kabir launches the airstrikes before Freddy and Rocky fight him off and kill him by impaling him on a spear. Amid failed password attempts, Priya awakens and suggests using \"Eklavya\", the name of Kabir's own clone. It works and the Karan Kavach is reactivated, averting the airstrike and a potential war. The team reunites and leaves the base, while Kabir awakens and is revealed to be alive."

Among them is a pregnant woman (Meher Vij) who, after giving birth, names her daughter Shahida after Shahid Afridi, the player who had won the game for Pakistan. On an afternoon, a six-year old Shahida falls off a cliff, but is saved by an overhanging tree. She loses her ability to speak from the accident. Her worried mother takes her to the shrine of Nizamuddin Auliya, a Sufi saint, in Delhi, on the belief that it would regain the latter's speech.\n\nReturning from Delhi, the train makes a stop for repairs. Shahida gets off to play with a lamb as her mother dozes off. Unbeknownst to Shahida, the train drives off. Shahida boards a freight train, reaching Kurukshetra in the Indian state of Haryana. Once there, she meets Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi also known as Bajrangi (Salman Khan), a devout Brahmin and an ardent devotee of the Hindu deity Hanuman. He christens her \"Munni\" and tries in vain to find where she lives.\n\nIn sequences of flashback, it is revealed that Bajrangi has been his father's reason for disappointment from his childhood due to failure in exams and being unable to fulfill his father's wishes. He graduates after eleven attempts at the exams, knowing which his father dies of shock. Bajrangi, looking for a job, goes to the house of his father's friend and wrestling coach, Dayanand (Sharat Saxena), in Delhi. Having spent time together with his daughter Rasika (Kareena Kapoor Khan), they fall in love with each other and Dayanand promises of getting them married on the condition that Bajrangi get employed and own a house. Cut to present, Bajrangi brings Munni to Dayanand's house, another devout Brahmin, who lets her stay on Bajrangi's convincing that Munni is a Brahmin as well, thanks to her fair complexion. Munni gets accustomed to being part of the household. A couple of incidents in the following days lead to the revealing that Munni is in fact, a Pakistani Muslim.

A sudden turn of events stirs him to take Munni to her parents in Pakistan, in person and without a passport and visa.\n\nWith an unofficial consent from Pakistani soldiers patrolling the order, Bajrangi and Munni enter into the main territory of Pakistan. Shortly after their arrival, Bajrangi is arrested, having been suspected for an Indian spy. He escapes with Munni and meets Chand Nawab (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), a correspondent employed with a Pakistani television channel, who has closely been following the developments. Moved by the story, Nawab joins Bajrangi in aiding him find Munni's parents. Also assisting them in their quest is an Islamic religious scholar (Om Puri), who helps them avoid capture by police and takes them to a safer location, and directs them to Pakistan-administered Kashmir, after Munni recognizes an area similar to her hometown, from a photo in a calendar.\n\nNawab captures their journey on video and narrates the story, and no channels agree to air it. Disappointed, he uploads the video on the Internet. Munni recognizes her mother walking by, in the video, and with a bus driver's assistance, the trio single out Sultanpur as Munni's hometown. They board a Sultanpur-heading bus, and are stopped by a squad of police who are on the lookout for 'the Indian spy'.

Meanwhile, Nawab and Munni reach Sultanpur, where Munni is finally reunited with her mother.\n\nThe first and the subsequent video uploaded by Nawab goes viral throughout India and Pakistan. A compassionate senior officer realizes that Bajrangi is innocent, and has him released, defying the order of keeping him in jail, what he felt would be petty on the part of Pakistan. Thousands of Pakistanis come to see Bajrangi off, and Indians to receive him, across the border. As Bajrangi crosses the border, Shahida, who is also in the crowd, runs toward the fence and cries out for him with her now regained speech; Bajrangi is ecstatic to see her, they run towards each other and embrace."

    "Banana Joe": "Bud Spencer plays Banana Joe, a brawny yet friendly man who lives in a small rainforest village called Amantido with a huge number of his own children and regularly delivers bananas to a South American river port (hence his name). One day, the henchmen of a local gangster boss named Torsillo come ashore in Amantido to initiate the construction a banana processing plant. Of course, Joe (in typical direct-approach manner) evicts the goons, who promptly return to their boss. Torsillo finds out that Joe is trading bananas without a license and decides to exploit it. Upon his next delivery, Joe is apprehended by the police and given the choice of either acquiring a legal license or getting his boat taken away and himself arrested for illegal shipment. Joe travels to the nearest city, which to him is a new world, as he grew up in the rainforest. Unfamiliar with city life and only marginally literate, he falls prey to a con man named Manuel, who has a gift of the gab which has placed him in favor in several high positions, even with the country's President for his help in developing a remedy for a genetic defect in the Presidential family. Eventually Joe meets Dorianne, an attractive singer, in a bar owned by Torsillo, where he gets a temporary job as a bouncer. Torsillo also runs into Joe personally time and again, and after having seen Joe easily finishing off five of his toughest goons, the gangster boss has taken to jumping out of the next window in a panic the instant he lays an eye on Joe. In pursuit of his license, Joe finds out that he must get himself registered with the authorities in order to \"exist\" legally. Since he has no proper official records, however, this proves to be highly difficult, and the constrictions and loop-holes of bureaucracy provide no help in resolving the matter. Joe even has to enlist in the Army, but after driving his drill sergeant to the point of despair and even to degradation, he deserts and lands himself in prison when in his impatience he takes matters (literally) into his own hands. In prison he re-encounters Manuel, whom he intends to pay back for his schemes, but it turns out that the con man actually has a heart of gold: having taken pity on Joe's plight, he had used his connections to get Joe the much-needed license. From Dorianne, who visits him in prison, Joe learns that Torsillo has used his absence to facilitate the construction of the banana plant. Joe and Manuel promptly break out of prison and return to Amantido, where Joe proceeds to thrash a newly built casino and Torsillo's thugs. Afterwards the police arrive, but not to arrest Joe. Instead they've been looking for Manuel: his remedy he had concocted for the President has worked, and Manuel (and Joe as well) receive amnesty as well as the fulfilment of a wish (Manuel decides to become Minister of Finance). To top it off, Torsillo is revealed to be no stranger to the authorities, and he and his entourage get arrested immediately. Dorianne decides to stay with Joe in Amantido, where she opens a school which Joe also attends, and Joe's life goes otherwise back to normal."

    "Band of the Hand": "Five young teenage criminals are arrested in and around Miami, Florida, and sent to Youth Hall to serve their sentences. They make up of two rival gang leaders, Ruben Pacecho (Michael Carmine), the Hispanic leader of the Home Boys serving a three-year sentence for aggravated assault and armed robbery; Moss Roosevelt (Leon Robinson), the African-American leader of the 27th Avenue Players also serving a three-year sentence for assault and armed robbery; Carlos Aragon (Danny Quinn), a suave drug trafficker serving a four-year sentence after being arrested in a police sting; James Lee \"J.L.\" McEwen (John Cameron Mitchell), a violent punk serving a 10-year sentence for manslaughter of his abusive and alcoholic father and various arson charges, and finally Dorcey Jon Bridger (Al Shannon), a car thief serving three-plus years for various auto theft and over 15 escape attempts from various juvenile halls.\n\nAt the juvenile prison, Ruben, J.L., Carlos, Moss and Dorcey taunt each other as they are transferred and released in the middle of the Everglades, where a group leader named 'Indian Joe' Tigre (Stephen Lang) makes them fend for themselves until the following morning. When Joe returns, he starts a fire, and shares some of the fish he caught. The five inmates demand to know what is happening. Joe informs them that the law has decided to treat them as adults because of their criminal records and the seriousness of their crimes, but the juveniles refuse to learn survival skills. Later, as rain drenches the group, Moss Roosevelt attacks Joe, but fails to take him hostage.\n\nJoe teaches the teenagers to use citronella oil to prevent mosquito bites, and how to build a bed from reeds growing in the swamp. Moss steals Dorcey's bed, but later Dorcey sets a trap that leaves Moss hanging upside down.\n\nBack in town, Carlos Aragon's girlfriend, Nikki (Lauren Holly), visits drug lord Nestor Quintana (James Remar) to ask if he knows where to find Carlos. Nestor assures Nikki that he will locate Carlos in exchange for sexual favors. As Nestor inhales cocaine, he orders Nikki to take off her clothes in his bedroom.\n\nBack in the Everglades, Joe and the group scavenge for food, and soon, a wild boar chases after them. They climb trees to avoid being attacked, and Joe stabs the boar with a spear. They surround and kill the animal, roast it over an open fire, and eat the meat for dinner. Afterward, Joe announces it is exam time. He gives them a map with a destination, and a compass, then leaves.\n\nThe next day the group sets off in a boat Joe has left them. Moss and Ruben Pacheco get into a fistfight after Ruben drops the compass in the swamp. Dorcey urges them to stop wasting time, and work together. Later, on land, when Moss falls in dense brush, Ruben helps him. After another day and evening in the swamp, they think they are lost, until they hear music. The sound leads them to an outdoor party with people, food, and drink. They see Joe, and he tells them that they are the first group to ever survive the rigors of the Everglades, and announces that their program continues in Miami.\n\nJoe and the five teen criminals move into an abandoned halfway house in \"Little Havana\" that Joe purchased from the city for one dollar. In the process, they evict junkies occupying the property, but allow Haitian squatters to remain. Soon, a drug lord named Cream (Laurence Fishburne) drives by the house in a white Rolls Royce convertible to see the reason for the commotion on his turf.\n\nLater, Carlos finds Nikki living in an expensive apartment. She claims that a friend lent her the place, but when Carlos does not believe her, she reveals she is working for Nestor. He accuses her of sleeping with Nestor and leaves. Nikki follows him to the apartment building lobby, and Nestor appears. He orders Nikki to his side, and tells Carlos to get lost.\n\nBack at the group house, Moss and Ruben prevent their respective former gangs from beating each other, then persuade the local Cubans to help paint the property.\n\nOne day, Joe and the group are playing basketball when Cream arrives and accuses Joe of muscling in on his turf. Joe pretends to surrender, then overpowers Cream and presses his face against the sidewalk. On Joe's command, Cream's men relinquish their weapons. As the group collects the firearms, Cream vows revenge and leaves with his entourage.\n\nLater, the teenagers cannot resist playing with Cream's arsenal and pretending to be big shots. Joe warns them that guns are not toys. He reveals that previous members of his program returned to the streets and fell to drugs and guns. He wants to clean up the neighborhood, and break Cream's dominance. He says it is his mission alone, but his charges agree to help. Joe teaches them teamwork and combat technique.\n\nAt a meeting, Cream assures Nestor he will destroy the halfway house. Nestor is not convinced, and threatens Cream so that he will carry out his plan. Back at the halfway house, Carlos tells Joe he is leaving in order to reunite with Nikki.\n\nLater, Nikki tells Carlos she has saved $10,000, and convinces him to leave Miami. While they are driving, Nikki tells Carlos that she overheard Cream's plan to destroy the halfway house. Carlos turns the car around and heads to Little Havana. Outside the halfway house, a gun battle rages between Joe, the youths, and Cream's gang. As the gunfight winds down, both Cream and Joe are killed. The group realizes that Nestor is the man behind Joe's death, and vow to destroy him.\n\nNestor is busy building three new cocaine-manufacturing plants in Miami, but gives his associate the order to kill Nikki. He does not see Joe's youths as a threat. Carlos, J. L., Ruben, Moss, and Dorcey follow Nestor's men to a compound in the Everglades. The youths devise a plan to blow up Nestor's heavily guarded warehouse. First, they distract guard dogs with a female dog in heat. Dorcey sets off a bomb made with gopher gas, while the others attack. A climatic gun battle commences between the teenagers and Nestor's guards, while a mini-gun turret on the roof sprays machine-gun fire. When Nestor sees Nikki hiding in the shadows, he throws down his gun, and walks toward her. When he reaches for her gun, she shoots him dead. Elsewhere, Dorcey explodes a series of bombs that destroy Nestor's operation.\n\nAs they drive away, Ruben comments that Joe should have been there in their moment of victory. When their car is stopped at a police checkpoint, they play dumb, and ask what is going on. The officer says he does not know, and after a few questions, he tells them to go easy on the beer, and lets them continue their journey. The five person group, now known as the 'Band of the Hand'; Ruben, Moss, J.L., Carlos, and Dorcey, along with Nikki, drive away into the night to an unknown future."

    "Bandidas": "Set in Mexico during the 1850s, the film tells the story of Sara Sandoval (Salma Hayek) and Maria Alvarez (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz). Maria is an uneducated, poor farm-girl whose caring father is being forced off his land by a cruel U.S. land baron, named Tyler Jackson (Dwight Yoakam). Sara is the highly educated, wealthy daughter of Don Diego Sandoval (Ismael 'East' Carlo), and has recently returned from Europe where she attended numerous grade schools and colleges in England, Spain, and France for several years. Don Diego runs a local Mexican bank and owns the mortgages on all the local land holdings.\n\nJackson meets Don Diego with an intention to purchase all the mortgages and then force the farmers off their land. Don Diego sells all the mortgages to Jackson for a good profit. Maria breaks into the castle of Don Diego to complain about the sale of her father's mortgage to the US Bank represented by Jackson and is arrested. Jackson is working with Ashe (Denis Arndt) (from the Capitol Bank and Trust of New York) to consolidate the land holdings so that they can sell it to the railroads at a hefty premium.\n\nAfter purchasing the mortgages, Jackson shoots all farmers who refuse to vacate the land, since they were all delinquent on their payments. Maria returns home to find her father shot and estate burned to the ground.\n\nIn one fell swoop, both Maria's and Sara's fathers fall under attack by the baron, (Sara's father is killed, Maria's is shot but survives). Sara returns home to find her father dead, apparently from a heart attack. Sara is unable to attack Jackson due to his overwhelming force. Sara manages to escape from Jackson and his goons who now control her father's entire estate.\n\nSara decides to rob her father's bank and finds that Maria already beat her to it and both women reach the bank one after the other. Sara wants the money to go back to Europe, but Maria wants to use the proceeds to help the destitute. As they fight, a local priest Padre Pablo (Jose Maria Negri) arrives and takes them to a nearby cave hideout, where all the displaced farmers and their families are staying as there is nowhere else for them to go. As an act of revenge, Maria and Sara team up to become bank robbers, stealing and giving back to the poor Mexicans who had lost their lands.\n\nAt first, the two are catty and quick to fight over the smallest matters over their different backgrounds, but under the tutelage of famed bank robber Bill Buck (Sam Shepard) they learn to trust each other. Bill Buck is a friend of the Padre Pablo and agrees to help the girls as Sara begs him that Jackson killed her father. Maria turns out to be a crack shot and, while Sara can barely hold a gun, she shows that she is an expert with throwing knives.\n\nDuring a training session, the two women are testing their strength by hanging off a cliff over a wide river, and at the last moment Maria swallows her pride and tells Sara she can't swim. Maria nearly drowns but is saved by Sara, and it is then that the two women put aside their differences and agree that, while they are not friends yet, they can at least work together as partners.\n\nSoon, the girls are ready and start robbing banks. The reward against their names keeps going up and up to $25,000. Angered by the recent attacks by the newly infamous 'Bandidas', Jackson brings in a specialist criminal investigator named Quentin Cooke (Steve Zahn). Now, Quentin is a very meticulous investigator and uses modern investigative methods such as fingerprinting and forensic analysis to determine the guilty parties.\n\nIt doesn't take long for Sara and Maria to hear of this, and they quickly capture Cooke and seduce him to help them. Sara and Maria take pictures with Quentin in compromising poses and threaten to send them to his fiance unless he cooperates with them. He has already figured out that Sara's father was murdered (he was poisoned) and therefore discovers that his employer is actually a criminal. Using Quentin as a prop, Sara teaches Maria how to kiss a man. As proof of Jackson's grand plan, the ladies show Quention all the stolen mortgage papers which have a contract clause that a farm that is behind in its payments can be bought by the bank in a single Peso. They demonstrate how all the farms being acquired lie along the proposed railroad route. In Jackson's office at the bank, Quentin finds a vial of poison, used to kill Don Diego. Quentin agrees to cooperate with the ladies.\n\nIn response, Jackson brings in reinforcements and now every bank is guarded heavily. So, Quentin pairs with Maria to infiltrate the banks, as the guards are looking for 2 women and not a couple. The trio embark upon bigger, more ambitious heists, during which Mar\u00eda and Sara compete for Quentin's affections, which he rebukes because he is engaged. Quentin helps the ladies open the safes with his Stethoscope, and Sara helps them escape from the outside.\n\nMeanwhile, all of Mexico's sovereign gold is also deposited with Jackson's bank. Jackson installs a state-of-the-art weight-based alarm system in his bank which triggers as soon as somebody steps on it. Sara and Quentin use skates to get to the safe by stepping into the gaps between the floorboards, where the alarm system is not implemented. But due to Maria's mistake who was on lookout, they are captured. As they are transported to be lynched, they are saved by the people of Mexico. In a move to make the money they have stolen useless; Jackson moves the gold that backs the money on a train up towards U.S. territories. Midway, he decides to steal the gold, betraying the Mexican government.\n\nThe Bandidas manage to hunt him down, but when they get their chance to kill him, they can't, feeling it would make them no better than him. Jackson manages to draw his gun and almost gets a shot off at Maria but Sara shoots first, finishing the villain off. In the end Quentin ends up with his fiance and Maria and Sara ride off into the sunset, their eyes set on Europe where the banks are, according to Sara, \"bigger\"."

Phoolan's aging father Devideen (Ram Charan Nirmalker) conforming to his culture, regrettably disagrees, and Phoolan is sent off with Puttilal.\n\nPhoolan is exposed to some sexual and exploitative abuses, including the caste system. (Phoolan's family as well as Puttilal's family belong to the lower ranked Mallah sub caste; the higher ranked Thakur caste takes the lead in social and political situations.) Puttilal is physically and sexually abusive, and Phoolan eventually runs away and returns home. As Phoolan grows older, she faces incidents of (non-consensual) fondling and groping from the Thakur men (whose parents make up the Panchayat or village government). At the next town meeting, the Panchayat wield their patriarchal authority to banish Phoolan from the village, since she will not consent to the sexual advances of the higher caste males, who treat her like sub-human chattel.\n\nAccordingly, Phoolan (Seema Biswas) leaves with her cousin Kailash (Saurabh Shukla). En route to another village, she encounters a troop of Dakus (bandits) of the Babu Gujjar gang, led by Vikram Mallah Mastana (Nirmal Pandey). Phoolan stays with Kailash for a while, but is eventually compelled to leave. Angry and hopeless, Phoolan goes to the local cops (to try to have her ban lifted), but she is beaten, molested, and arrested by the cops, who sexually assault her while in custody. The Thakurs put up bail and have her released. But, unknown to her, the bail is a bribe (paid, through the cops, to Babu Gujjar's gang), and Babu Gujjar arrives to collect his prize.\n\nIn May 1979, Phoolan is abducted by Babu Gujjar (Anirudh Agarwal). Gujjar is a ruthless, imposing mercenary. Although Gujjar's lieutenant Vikram is sympathetic towards Phoolan, Gujjar indiscriminately brutalizes and humiliates her, until one day Vikram catches him sexually assault her (yet again) and shoots him in the head. Vikram takes over the gang, and his empathy for Phoolan eventually grows into a mutually respectful mature adult relationship. Around this time, Phoolan revisits her former husband Puttilal, and with Vikram's help, abducts him and exacts her justice for his sexual assault and abuse, beating him up. She shares her closure with Vikram.\n\nAll goes well until Thakur Shri Ram (Govind Namdeo) is released from prison. Thakur Shri Ram is the real gang leader (boss of the erstwhile Gujjar). Shri Ram returns to his gang and while Vikram receives him with respect, Shri Ram bristles at Vikram's egalitarian leadership style and covets Phoolan. In August 1980, Shri Ram arranges to have Vikram assassinated, and abducts Phoolan, bringing her to the village of Behmai. Phoolan is repeatedly sexually assaulted and beaten by Shri Ram and by the rest of the gang members, as punishment for her \"disrespect\" for his previous advances, and for her audacity at being an equal. The stunning and disturbing final humiliation and punishment is that she is stripped, paraded around Behmai, beaten and sent to fetch water from the well (in full view of the village).\n\nA severely traumatized Phoolan returns to her cousin Kailash. She recovers gradually, and seeks out Man Singh (Manoj Bajpai), an old friend of Vikram Mallah. Man Singh brings her to another large gang, led by Baba Mustakim (Rajesh Vivek). She relates her history to Baba and asks him for some men and weapons to form a gang. Baba Mustakim agrees, and Man Singh and Phoolan become the leaders for the new gang.\n\nPhoolan leads her new gang with courage, generosity, humility and shrewdness. Her stockpile and her legend grows. She becomes known as Phoolan Devi, the bandit queen. In February 1981, Baba Mustakim informs her of a large wedding in Behmai, with Thakur Shri Ram in attendance. As Phoolan departs, Baba Mustakim warns her to remain low key. Phoolan attacks the wedding party and her gang exacts revenge from the entire Thakur clan of Behmai. They round up the men and beat them up. Many of the men are finally shot. This act of vengeance brings her to the attention of the national law enforcement authorities (in New Delhi). The top police officials now begin a massive manhunt for Phoolan, and Thakur Shri Ram relishes the opportunity to come to their aid.\n\nThe manhunt claims many lives in Phoolan's gang. They are ultimately forced to hide out in the rugged ravines of Chambal without any food or water. Phoolan evaluates her options and decides to surrender. Her terms are to have her remaining mates protected and provided for (the women and children in particular). The film ends with Phoolan's surrender in February 1983. The end credits indicate that all the charges against her were withdrawn (including the charges of murder at Behmai), and that she was released in 1994."

    "Bang Bang!": "The film opens in UK where Colonel Viren Nanda (Jimmy Shergill) goes to meet a wanted terrorist Omar Zafar (Danny Denzongpa) in his holding cell. As Viren informs Zaffar that he will be extradited back to India for his crimes as per a new extradition treaty that India is signing with friendly nations, Zafar's men enter his holding cell, lead by Hamid Gul (Jaaved Jaffrey), murdering all guards around them, with Zaffar then murdering Viren by shooting him and then burning him. As Zaffar escapes in a helicopter waiting on the roof, he puts a $5 million reward for someone to steal the Koh-i-Noor diamond from the Tower of London, but with one condition - the thief must be Indian, in order to hold up a new extradition treaty between India and UK.\n\nSoon after, a man named Rajveer Nanda (Hrithik Roshan) steals it, and when Zaffar's men are informed of the theft, they travel to Rajveer in Shimla for the deal. Although they initially travel with the $5 million reward, Rajveer informs them that he now wants $20 million for the deal. Following the disdain of the comment made by Rajveer, a fight breaks out between Rajveer and Zaffar's men after which Rajveer flies away. After Rajveer escapes, a CCTV footage of him is captured, showing that he is in Shimla which makes the Indian Govt to devote its ISS forces to recover the Kohinoor to save the extradition treaty.\n\nFollowing Rajveer's escape, he sees Harleen (Katrina Kaif) sitting in a restaurant, who is there waiting for her internet date, \"Vickie\", to show up. Rajveer enters the restaurant posing as \"Vickie\" and woos her over. He convinces Harleen to use the bathroom and whilst she is in there, Rajveer fights the remaining men (who followed him to the restaurant from the location of the failed negotiation) and leaves the restaurant, much to the dismay of Harleen. As she drives home, Harleen accidentally runs over Rajveer, who asks her to stitch up a gunshot wound sustained during the fight. Rajveer then gives Harleen drugged water, with her complying with what he says about the government officials, informing her about where to find guns underneath car seats and what they will say about him.\n\nThe next day, the government officials with Zorawar (Pawan Malhotra) visit Harleen at her bank and threaten her to come with them. They tell her that if she does not accompany them, then they will reveal everything to her colleagues. Harleen decides to go with them to the police station. In the car, Zorawar tells her that they are not going to the station but they are taking her to a \"mehfooz\" (safe) place instead. Harleen remembers about the gun that Rajveer had told her. She engages the other official in small talk and finds the gun. She threatens both the officers to stop the car and let her go. At the same time, Rajveer appears on a bike and a chase sequence ensues. Both Rajveer and Harleen find a car and escape. When Rajveer goes out to shoot the goons, Harleen escapes and then bumps into her boss, Karan. She tells him about Rajveer and how random people are firing at her. Rajveer follows her. Karan tries to protect Harleen from Rajveer. He annoys Rajveer and gets shot by him in the leg. Harleen is exasperated but leaves with Rajveer again lest he shoots any more people.\n\nIn the car, Harleen and Rajveer get into an argument. Harleen states that she wants to go home and that she did a huge mistake by trusting him. Rajveer angrily decides to let Harleen go and hands over the car keys to her. He tells her that he has no other motive then protecting her. She feels guilty and decides to stick to him. They begin to drive again in silence. Rajveer checks a location on his phone which Harleen notices. He then tells her that he has not killed an innocent person before this and does not want her to die. He tries to convince her to come with him for dinner.\n\nThey go to Pizza Hut where Rajveer realizes that he has no money to buy food. Harleen eventually pays for the pizza. Harleen asks him about the crime that he has committed and Rajveer shows her the Koh-i-Noor much to her surprise. She has a hard time believing that he is indeed a thief. As she comes to know about Rajveer, they realize that they were followed by Zorawar who says he has the restaurant surrounded with his men and will not be afraid to shoot Rajveer if needed to. As the officials convince Harleen to go with them, Rajveer tells Harleen that he cannot let her go with them. He shoots her with a tranquilizer dart and they both jump out of a window and escape.\n\nHarleen slips in and out of consciousness as Rajveer continues to take her to safety. She wakes up in a beach shack wearing a bikini top and hot pants. She angrily asks Rajveer as to who changed her clothes and he confesses that he did it. She is irked beyond words. She beats him and bites his hand. Harleen then takes Rajveer's phone to call her grandmother, unbeknownst to her it allows the Government officials to track their position. After a shootout occurs between Rajveer and the Government officials, he escapes with Harleen with a help of a sea bob and a fly board.\n\nHarleen wakes up the next morning in Prague. As Rajveer was able to successfully lead the escape of them both, Harleen now entrusts Rajveer, subsequently falling in love with him. Rajveer when goes out of his hotel with Harleen, he sees that they are wanted by INTERPOL .Some policemen come at the moment and Rajveer kisses Harleen .Rajveer tracks Hamid Gul at a casino. Although he was to go alone, Harleen insists to take her along, to which he agrees. Staging a ploy for Gul's attention, Harleen and Gul meet in the hallway, who tells her that a romantic candlelit champagne drink is waiting for her on the roof of the casino. Following this, Rajveer visits Gul at the top of the casino, a fight ensues regarding the whereabouts of Zaffar and he ultimately kills Gul. In the meantime Harleen is caught by Zorawar and is taken to the Indian Embassy in Prague, where Zorawar says that Rajveer actually came to Prague to find Gul. Harleen is asked to get the Koh-i-Noor back. That night, the two meet on a bridge, where Harleen says that the trust between them is broken. Rajveer activates the tracking device himself, allowing the officials to surround them. Rajveer gives the Koh-i-Noor to Harleen and jumps from the bridge and is assumed dead.\n\nHarleen then returns home and remembers an address that Rajveer had listed on his phone. At the address, Harleen meets Rajveer's father (Kanwaljit Singh) and his mother (Deepti Naval). At the house, Harleen sees photos of Rajveer (Jai) and Viren, who are later revealed to be brothers and Rajveer's mother revealing their back stories. Although it is confirmed that Viren was murdered, Rajveer's father says that he does not believe the story the Army told him, saying that Rajveer had drowned despite being a swimming champion in his youth, he was the only student who was able to cross the lake in only one breath. On her way home, Harleen is kidnapped by Zaffar, who knows that the diamond was a fake. Zorawar is then revealed to be Zaffar's right-hand man, and gives Harleen a truth-revealing drug to reveal the location of the real diamond. Harleen tells that Rajveer would have survived and is coming to kill Zaffar. Rajveer, silently kills every guard posted outside and places time bombs in every corner and enters the room. Zaffar then orders his men to beat Rajveer but before Zaffar is able to kill him Rajveer informs that the Koh-i-Noor was not stolen at all and it was a joint operation between MI6 and the Indian Secret Service to get Zaffar. The time bombs go off and destroys the castle. But Zaffar manages to escape and captures Harleen again, after making Rajveer crash. As they escape with her, Rajveer follows them with a F1 car and catches up to them. Zaffar enters a flight with Harleen. Killing the rest of Zaffar's men including Zorawar, Rajveer shoots at the flight blades evidently grounding the plane. Rajveer soon boards the plane and a final bout takes place between him and Zafar. After throwing him to the flames, Rajveer frees Harleen. When they are escaping from the aircraft, Zaffar emerges from the flames again and shoots Rajveer. Rajveer pushes Harleen out of the aircraft and a second bullet hits him. He then grabs the ax and charges towards Zaffar and kills him. When the aircraft is about to explode, he jumps out. He looses consciousness and is about to drown when Harleen grabs his hand. The authorities air lift an injured and unconscious Rajveer and Harleen.\n\nRajveer then wakes up in hospital, where his boss is sitting across him waiting for him to wake up. He congratulates Rajveer for successfully completing the mission. He rues about the fact that his brother was murdered and that his parents will never get to see him again. Also, he informs Rajveer that Harleen has been sent back to her home and he has to forget about her because she can become a threat to his life and also his weakness. Rajveer is also told that he will be shifted to a safe facility the next day. After the chief leaves, a nurse arrives and gives Rajveer a medicine to drink. As soon as Rajveer gulps down the medicine, he feels giddy and asks the nurse about it. The nurse turns around and removes her mask revealing that she is actually Harleen and the medicine is a sedative meant to knock Rajveer out. A surprised Rajveer tries to say her name but Harleen asks him to keep quiet. Rajveer faints and Harleen escapes from the hospital along with him. He continues to slip in and out of consciousness until the next morning. He wakes up and Harleen tells him that his \"ek din\"(some day) has arrived. Rajveer realizes that she has brought him to his house. He silently thanks her, and they both meet his parents."

    "Bangkok Dangerous": "Joe (Nicolas Cage) is a professional freelance contract killer who works strictly by the rules; never socializing outside his work, staying secluded in quiet spots, never interacting or meeting with his handlers (& not asking questions) and always leaving on time without a trace. He always has an escape plan. He usually hires young pickpockets or small-time criminals as his local help, whom he usually murders after the end of the job to prevent any identification. He uses multiple aliases and also has middlemen between him and his handlers. He also carries a watch to perform a hit in specific time and correctly visualizes his every target. The work is steady, and the money is good, but the job requires strict discipline.\n\nAfter completing a hit in Prague (where he kills a mob snitch who was in police custody, with a sniper rifle through a window of the police station) and killing his current help (he makes it look like a drug overdose), Joe travels to Bangkok for an assignment to assassinate four people for notorious Bangkok crime boss Surat (Nirattisai Kaljaruek), whom he never meets. For Joe, this is the last job, and he plans to retire after taking the money.\n\nJoe occasionally provides insight via voiceover narration throughout the film. Joe hires a secluded mansion where he has privacy. He hires a local Thai pickpocket named Kong (Shahkrit Yamnarm), after observing his work stealing from tourists at the local market, and who has simple English knowledge, as his go-between in Bangkok, a condition of the contract being that the gang will never meet Joe. Joe pays Kong 3000 Baht a day and promises a month's worth of work. Contracts from the Bangkok gangsters are passed to Kong one by one via a nightclub dancer, Aom (Panward Hemmanee). Kong presents a particularly marked currency note to Aom and in exchange, she gives the contract in a package. Joe tracks the first target and follows the persons daily route from office to home in the evening. Joe's first execution in Bangkok is done on motorcycle; when the target car stops at a red light, Joe kills all the occupants with a MAC-11.\n\nKong retrieves information about the second target, again via Aom, and the pair become friendlier with every contact. After getting the 2nd briefcase, Kong is attacked by muggers, but he manages to fight them off and delivers the briefcase to Joe, even though it was cracked open by the muggers. Kong had seen the contents of the briefcase and knew that Joe is an assassin. Unsatisfied with Kong's assistance, Joe contemplates killing him, he instead decides to act as Kong's mentor and trains him for self-defense. Joe says that he didn't kill Kong as he saw a bit of himself in Kong. Joe teaches Kong the basics of hand-to-hand combat, shooting firearms and using the surroundings to your advantage.\n\nBefore Joe executes his mission, Kong informs him of the target, Pramod Juntasa, another notorious gang lord and Surat's rival crime boss who acts as a sex trafficker, buying young girls from impoverished parents and selling them for sex. Joe sneaks into the target's penthouse and drowns him in his pool.\n\nJoe meets Fon (Charlie Yeung), a deaf-mute pharmacist, with whom he becomes intrigued after a brief consultation. Joe had to visit the pharmacy to buy some medicines after he got injured after the first getaway. Fon looks at the wound and suggests the right medicines for Joe. Joe later returns to the pharmacy to invite Fon out for dinner. Soon after Joe falls for Fon and meets her mother, the affair is cut short when he shoots and kills two assailants in Fon's presence. Blood splatters on Fon, and she runs off, trembling and traumatized by the violent deaths. Feeling betrayed, Fon cannot forgive Joe and ends their relationship.\n\nBefore the third kill, the gang attempts to identify Joe by following Kong after he picks the briefcase from Aom. Kong notices that he is being followed and leaves the briefcase as instructed by Joe. Joe calls Surat and warns them off. For the third execution that takes place at the Damnoen Saduak floating market, Kong assists Joe. The kill does not go as planned, and the target, a playboy and a criminal underworld associate, nearly gets away but Joe manages to catch and assassinate him. Before beginning his last mission Joe visits Fon, presumably to say goodbye. She initially ignores him but as Joe begins to drive away, she runs after his car.\n\nHis fourth target is the Prime Minister of Thailand, who is revered by many for helping the poor but a great hindrance to Surat due to his hard-liner crackdown on organized crime. Joe is about to make the kill when he has second thoughts, is spotted, and escapes through a panicking crowd.\n\nMeanwhile, the gang has abducted Aom and Kong with plans to execute them. Joe, now a target, is attacked at his house by four of Surat's henchmen. He uses explosives to take them out and is faced with the choice of rescuing Kong or leaving the country unharmed. Joe decides to rescue Kong, so he sets off to the gang's headquarters with one of the half-alive attackers.\n\nJoe goes to the gang's headquarters, kills most of the gang including Surat's under-boss/bodyguard (who is blown into half by explosives), and saves Kong and Aom. The fearful gang leader flees to his car with three other accomplices. Joe spots him and shoots the gang members, then gets into the back seat with Surat. As the police arrive at the location, Joe realizes he has only one bullet. He puts his head adjacent to Surat's, puts the gun up to his temple and pulls the trigger, killing himself and Surat."

    "Barbie: Spy Squad": "The film opens with a young woman in a rainbow wig, cat mask, and cat ear headband infiltrating a museum, dodging the lasers to the burglar alarm, and stealing a rainbow-colored gem from a display case. She shows amazing gymnastic and athletic skill, and is armed with several technological devices to help her, including one that melts glass into vapor. As she escapes, she cockily smirks and sets off the burglar alarm on purpose, before disappearing into the night.\n\nThe next day, Barbie, Renee, and Teresa are training for the Gold Cup tournament with a group floor routine. Chelsea and Mila, training for a junior competition, cheer their big sisters on, as does Renee's elderly and eccentric aunt Zoe, who hasn't missed a meet in years. After warm-ups, the emcee announces the tryouts to be allowed to enter the competition have begun. Several gymnasts go, including a taller and older girl named Patricia who dominates the competition on the high bar. Barbie and the others realize that with her score of 9.9, they'll have to do something pretty special to be allowed in to the competition. They pull off their best routine up until the finish, but the pyramid formation they attempt at the end is not a success, as Barbie manages to psych herself out by overthinking matters and doesn't complete her part of the trick successfully. They get into the competition, but only by the skin of their teeth.\n\nAs the three leave the gymnasium, Barbie is irritated that she got into her head so much and messed things up. To celebrate their getting into the competition, Aunt Zoe texts them that she's arranged a picnic at the top of Mt. Lee, near the Hollywood Sign. They head up there with their picnic gear, but when they arrive discover a secret entrance in the \"Y\" of the sign, which leads them through a series of electronic doors and scanners to the headquarters of what is clearly a secret agency. The people there seem to have every kind of cool gadget on the planet, up to and including an automatic pizza maker, and no one seems surprised or even very interested at the presence of the girls. Aunt Zoe meets them, and explains her 'crazy cat lady' persona is really only a facade, and that she is actually the director of this chapter of the agency. She is also from England by birth and when talking in her normal voice has a strong English accent - this rather freaks out Renee, who had no idea up until this point. She reveals, much to the group's astonishment, that she has sent for them because of their skills as a gymnastics team, to combat the athletic cat burglar who has been stealing gems recently.\n\nBarbie and the Girls sit down with Zoe and her assistant, Agent Dunbar, and review the case. SEcurity footage of the cat burglar setting off the alarm as she leaves the scenes of her crimes shows her athletic skill and cockiness. She is targeting only a certain type of crystal gems, the complete set of which are scattered across collections of museums and rich people all around California. This set of gems was deliberately scattered and sold because they were initially part of an electromagnetic pulse weapon that the agency was developing. The weapon was proved to be far too powerful to control and could possibly cause irrevocable damage and blackouts to the infrastructure of every country in the world, among other things. The weapon was dismantled and the plans were supposed to be destroyed, but these plans were lost or stolen before this could come to be. The agency fears that someone is attempting to rebuild the weapon and has hired this cat burglar to steal the gems for them. They want Barbie and her friends to use their skills to quietly follow the cat burglar, retrieving any crystals if they can, and find out who she is working for.\n\nInitially, Teresa is very hesitant about accepting the mission and entering training, but the other two are so enamored of the idea that they immediately follow Agent Dunbar and Aunt Zoe's robotic assistant cat Violet as they show them around the agency and where they will be training. According to intelligence, they have only 24 hours to train before the thief tries for the next jewel, so he gets them suited up an takes them to meet Lazlo, the young genius in charge of most of their new devices, and Percy, Violet's dog-like counterpart in charge of accompanying the girls on their missions. Lazlo immediately falls for Teresa, and she for him, due to a shared love of robotics and programming.\n\nAmong other things, they discover their suits can make them temporarily partially or fully invisible, that they can all make their faces look like Lazlo's, and other helpful things like glitter bombs, grappling hook backpacks, and a device Barbie particularly enjoys called a GLISS, which acts as a vaulting pole and a boomerang rolled into one. After training hard with Agent Dunbar, they set out on their new motorcycles from the agency to the place where one of the remaining three jewels is being kept, at the top of a high building. When the girls arrive, carefully making their way through a laser field that protects the gem, they discover that the cat burglar has already stolen the gem, and is waiting for them. She taunts them as they furiously chase her, using her superior skill to evade them. As the girls follow her with their grappling hooks, rappelling down the sides of the building, Teresa suffers from a spell of vertigo and cannot continue, after her hook shifts. Renee stay behind to help her, and Barbie continues alone. However, the thief mocks her and successfully gets into her head, waiting for her to catch up and telling her she isn't being a good friend to the rest of her team. Barbie finally abandons the chase and returns to help Renee with Teresa, just as the latter's hook comes undone. Percy and Barbie save them from falling to their deaths, but in the process the thief gets away, using a motorcycle not unlike the one the girls were given by Lazlo to escape.\n\nThe next day, the girls are still upset about their failure, as is Agent Dunbar, who is contemptuous of their youth and inexperience, but Aunt Zoe encourages them by saying there was nothing they could have done, and that they simply have to try again. As Lazlo shows off more gadgetry and outfits for them, Barbie goes off alone to train some more. Aunt Zoe gives her some pointers on how to keep her focus and confidence and not psych herself out. The next gem is being held at a mansion where a gala is scheduled to occur. With Percy's help, and some costumes from Lazlo, they infiltrate the gala as chefs while Percy communicates to them via their earbuds from outside to let them know of any danger. Once inside, the real chef presses them into service helping him, causing a delay until the girls cause a huge mess in the kitchen that allows them to escape. They then use their computerized costumes to change appearance to look like patrons of the Gala, and get in position to guard the gem, just as a power surge causes a blackout. Percy tells them he sensed someone up on the far end of the building, but just as they get there someone cuts his communication. The girls realize it was a trick to lure them from their spot, and sure enough encounter the thief, who again already has the jewel and has waited for them to catch up, enjoying taunting them as she makes her way across some gigantic lighting sculptures that span from balcony to balcony. There is a large gap between two of them, and the thief does a triple Arabian flip, something thought impossible, to get across the gap. She mocks Barbie and asks why they bother to try to keep up with her, and as Barbie attempts to make the jump and nearly falls to the floor, the thief again escapes into the night.\n\nWith only one jewel left, Aunt Zoe's superiors tell her to scrap the gymnast program and send Barbie and the other two home. The stakes are now too high and it isn't as important to keep up with and follow the thief anymore as it is to have someone guarding the jewels. Percy is devastated to see them go, as is Lazlo and Aunt Zoe herself. They return, dejected, to their gymnastics training. However, Lazlo secretly smuggles their motorcycles and other gear to them, saying they can have the fun of messing with them for at least one more day before he takes them back.\n\nAt training, Barbie watches Chelsea attempting a standing flip but failing, and gives her the same advice on focus Aunt Zoe gave her. It works, and Chelsea completes the trick successfully. Barbie then overhears the older gymnast Patricia use the phrase \"I don't know why you bother to keep up with me\", and recognizes her voice, though of course without her wig and cat costume she bears no resemblance to the thief. When she does a triple Arabian flip to dismount the high bar, the girls' suspicions are confirmed. Patricia, when confronted, indicates she deliberately let them know it was her, because she knows they can't do a thing about it, and leaves. Now both infuriated and intrigued, the girls decide to suit up against orders and follow Patricia when she steals the last gem. She gives them the slip, but this time Barbie was able to get close enough to put a tracking device on her motorcycle, undetected. The girls take their time and follow the signal, and are led back to the Hollywood sign and the agency. Entering via stealth mode with Percy's help, they follow Patricia by sneaking through the air vents, and watch as she gives the last crystal to Agent Dunbar. Teresa tries to get hold of Lazlo and Renee tries to get hold of Aunt Zoe, but no one answers. However, Lazlo belatedly returns the missed call just as they get close enough to hear Patricia and Dunbar's conversation, and the ringing wristwatch phone alerts Dunbar to their presence. Teresa barely has time to tell Lazlo what's going on before Dunbar uses several reprogrammed training bots to capture them.\n\nDunbar reveals that when the project for the Electromagnetic Pulse weapon was canceled, his promotion was also canceled with it, leaving Aunt Zoe to be the director of their division. Having seen the destruction it's capable of, and being rather power hungry, he intends to first disable the agency's massive super computers as revenge, and then use the weapon to rise to power unchallenged, possibly even becoming a global dictator if the weapon is as powerful as predicted. Patricia, who thought this was all a stunt and did not realize what she was stealing the gems for (she just wanted to earn some cash on the side and the stunt appealed to her competitive nature), immediately breaks ties with Dunbar, not liking where this is going. He tells her she has to pick a side but she says she is her own side, and easily uses her skills to evade him and escape. He and a group of the training bots set off to find the main supercomputer of the agency, leaving the rest to hold the girls captive. Lazlo appears, and Barbie uses her GLISS to break free while he and the other two fight and subdue the training bots to get them back to their original programming, planning to follow her.\n\nBarbie pursues Dunbar through the agency, which is deserted for the night. He uses his own training and skills to fight her off, with the aid of his robots. Patricia, who has not yet left, reluctantly joins in to help Barbie to try to stop him, not wanting to be part of the larger crime and possible war. She admits also that seeing Barbie and the others work as a team has got her to rethink her \"always work Solo\" mantra. Lazlo, Percy, Violet, and the other two girls arrive with the reprogrammed training bots, but Dunbar sets off the weapon just as Aunt Zoe arrives with two of her own bots, to denounce his treason and apprehend him. He is arrested and flown away by the bots, but laughs that they are too late to stop his revenge against the agency. Sure enough, the weapon has powered up and proceeds to emit powerful energy pulses, disabling Violet, Percy, and all the technology in the area except Barbie's Gliss. The weapon is too strong to be broken, though several try, and at Patricia's suggestion Barbie uses the Gliss to pry out one of the gems. This causes the machine to short circuit and fail before any permanent damage is done.\n\nThe girls are reinstated as secret agents, though allowed to continue their gymnastics as well. With Barbie, Renee, and Teresa's Testimony for what they overheard, as well as for her redeeming actions during the showdown with Dunbar, Patricia is acquitted on most of the charges against her and given probation - however, this means she cannot compete in the Gold Cup competition . She cheers Barbie and the girls on with Chelsea, Mali and Aunt Zoe from the stands as they perform their group tumbling routine, this time completing all the tricks successfully and earning first place in the competition. Afterwards, they are asked if they would like to participate in another mission and eagerly suit up to do so."

    "Barely Lethal": "The girls of Prescott Academy are taught practically since birth how to become trained assassins. Their number one rule is \"no attachments\". Number 83 (Hailee Steinfeld) has always had curiosity of the world outside the Academy, however. Despite her excellent work in the field, she has dreamt of a normal life. Her mentor Hardman (Samuel L. Jackson) has always discouraged her and the other girls from becoming attached to anything. 83's skills have also made her rivals with 84 (Sophie Turner).\n\nHardman assigns the girls to capture wanted arms dealer Victoria Knox (Jessica Alba). The agents head to Chechnya to apprehend her. 83 goes undercover as one of those captured and brought before Knox. She manages to latch herself and Knox onto an oncoming jet with Hardman on it. When they get high and far enough, 83 drops herself into a river while the other agents apprehend Knox. They find no sign of 83 and declare her MIA.\n\n83 goes into hiding to start her new life as a regular teenager. She brushes up on her teen culture through popular magazines and watching movies like \"Mean Girls\" and \"Bring It On\", then enrolls in a high school and goes through an exchange program to live with the Larson family under the name Megan Walsh. She is picked up by Mrs. Larson (Rachael Harris) and her children Liz (Dove Cameron) and Parker (Jason Ian Drucker). Parker already likes Megan but Liz is cold and distant.\n\nMegan/83 picks a ridiculous outfit for her first day of school and is immediately laughed at. Liz gets embarrassed and gives her new clothes to put on. Megan gets introduced to the students at an assembly where she says she is from Regina, Canada, but she pronounces it to rhyme with \"vagina\". The students laugh at her, but she is saved by the school's most popular guy, Cash (Toby Sebastian), as he goes up to play his guitar and sing. He then performs onstage with his band, Emotacon.\n\nAs Megan continues her new life as a high school student, she makes friends with a geeky kid named Roger (Thomas Mann), who has an interest in her, despite her attraction to Cash. Megan finds out she's in a biology class with him and hacks the system to make him her lab partner, to the ire of two mean girls. As retaliation, the girls convince Megan that Cash loves girls with school spirit and suggest she try out for the position of school mascot. Using her combat skills in her tryout, Megan scores the position. During a game, a few kids from a rival school come and try to kidnap Megan as part of an annual tradition. She kicks their asses and the video of her doing this goes viral. It earns her some popularity, but also annoys Liz.\n\nBack at Prescott, Hardman is holding Knox in captivity. 84 walks in on them as Knox tells Hardman that Prescott destroys lives, and she's not just talking about the targets.\n\nMegan spends more time with Cash, to Roger's dismay. As she's walking home, she is apprehended by a Prescott analyst (Jaime King) and is brought back to Hardman. He is ready to have his minion Pedro (Steve-O) torture Megan under the assumption that she is working with enemies of Prescott. He injects her with a truth serum and realizes she is honest when she says she only wanted to enjoy a normal life outside the Academy. Pedro also sympathizes with Megan as she cries. Hardman lets her go but warns her that if she gets into trouble, they won't be there to bail her out. They dump her on the front porch of the Larson house to make Megan look like she's super drunk.\n\nMegan gets invited to a big party at the home of the school's class clown Gooch (Gabriel Basso). Mrs. Larson encourages Megan to go and makes Liz join her. At the party, Megan continues to hang out with Cash, while Liz gets drunk with Gooch in his bathtub, learning that his name is really Bernard and that he's not a total jerk. To Megan's surprise, 84 is there, now going by Heather. Megan thinks Hardman sent Heather to shadow her, but she has her own plan brewing. She goes after cash to piss Megan off, forcing them into a game. Megan eventually wins Cash's attention and gets asked by him to the homecoming dance.\n\nThe next morning, Mrs. Larson is upset with Megan and Liz since Liz passed out and got a dick drawn on her face. Megan is later about to take the bus to school when she sees that Hardman is driving a bus and only passes through to warn Megan that Knox has escaped from Prescott. Liz drives Megan to school, but they are pursued by a masked assassin. Megan steers them away from danger and admits to Liz her secret. They crash in a junkyard while also getting the assassin to crash. Megan goes to investigate and smells what she recognizes to be Ke$ha perfume, meaning it was Heather that tried to murder them.\n\nLiz is in the hospital after the crash. Megan tells her she has to leave before anybody else gets hurt. Liz responds that Megan trying to abandon the family would be worse.\n\nThe girls go to the homecoming dance. Megan realizes that Cash is kind of a boring person and dumps him. She goes to apologize to Roger, who is still sort of upset with her, and then she finds out that his date is Heather. She provokes Megan's rage and they fight in the gym. They spill punch on the mean girls, who then start to fight each other. Heather chases Megan into the hallway where they end up in the kitchen. Heather says she joined Knox for the chance to kill Megan herself. She also brags about making out with Cash AND Roger. Liz sneaks up on Heather and stabs her in the leg with a corn dog stick, allowing Megan to whack Heather over the head and knock her out.\n\nMegan returns home to find that Knox and some goons have taken Parker and Mrs. Larson hostage. Megan fights the goons but Liz gets captured as well. Knox reveals that she was the very first Prescott girl, but she left and turned against them for robbing her of her life. Hardman shows up with reinforcements to take out the goons and tranquilize Knox. Megan knows Hardman came back to help her, despite his denial, and she hugs him. Parker asks Hardman how he can get in on the action, and he tells him to apply for the Prescott boys school. He excitedly asks his mom if he can."

    "Basic": "A helicopter circles over the Panamanian jungle. On board is a team of Army Ranger trainees and their instructor, Master Sergeant Nathan West (Samuel L. Jackson). Their objective is to move through the jungle in hurricane weather, use live ammo to hit pop-up metal targets, then rendezvous at a small bunker. Seventeen hours later, Colonel Bill Styles (Timothy Daly) is aboard a helicopter searching for the same team he had expected back on base a long time ago. He witnesses three of his rangers, later identified as Ray Dunbar, Second Lieutenant Levi Kendall and Mueller, emerge from the jungle. However, things seem to have gone horribly wrong as Dunbar and Mueller are shooting at each other and Kendall is unconscious on Dunbar's shoulders. Dunbar kills Mueller in self-defense. The rest of the team, including West, are not found and presumed dead.\n\nIn an interrogation room back on base, Captain Julia Osborne (Connie Nielsen) makes little headway with Dunbar, who refuses to talk. He is given a pad of paper on which he writes that he will only speak to a fellow Ranger, someone from outside the base, and draws an \"8\" inside a circle on the piece of paper. Noticeably spooked upon seeing the 8, base commander, Colonel Styles calls in a friend and experienced interrogator, Tom Hardy (John Travolta). Hardy, an ex-Ranger who quit the army, is now a DEA agent who is presently under investigation for suspicion of bribery. We also find out that Hardy served under West when he was a Ranger and hated him. Hardy and Osborne, initially wary of each other, are forced to work together during the 6 hours they are given before the CID transportation from Washington will arrive to take Dunbar and Kendall away to initiate an investigation. Styles wants to provide as many answers as possible before they take over so their investigation can be as quiet as possible.\n\nOsborne doesn't approve Hardy's involvement in her investigation because of his messy resume but does come around when Hardy strikes a conversation with Dunbar, who, until now, had not uttered a single word, proving he is more qualified than he looks. The audience learns through Dunbar that West is infamous for being a ruthless, tough-as-nails sergeant. One trainee in Dunbar's unit, a black soldier named Pike, earned West's wrath more than any other. Pike was selected for the Panama training mission along with Dunbar, Kendall, Mueller and two other soldiers, Nunez and Castro. Since he seemed to have plenty of reasons to hate West, it is suggested that Pike had enough motive to murder him. At this point, Dunbar refuses to say anything more but confirms that the other members of the team and West are all dead.\n\nHardy and Osborne then visit the other surviving team member, Second Lieutenant Levi Kendall, who is recovering from gunshot wounds sustained during the mission. It is revealed that Kendall is the son of a Joint Chiefs of Staff general. At the hospital, Hardy runs into Dr. Peter Vilmer (Harry Connick Jr.), an old friend, and also Osborne's on-again, off-again lover. Kendall reveals that he's gay and once had a homosexual relationship with another soldier that became public. His father pulled some strings to have Kendall transferred to West's unit to cover up the scandal. He claims West hated him for that. He also claims that West silently threatened his life in the helicopter, shortly before the mission began. Kendall was partnered with Castro for the mission and feared that West may have bribed Castro to give him a \"training accident\".\n\nKendall explains that during the exercise, they found West dead, apparently hit in the back with a white phosphorus grenade, and that Pike later confessed to the crime, thinking that his comrades would go along with it. However, the team decided to turn Pike in when they would be picked up the next morning. In the middle of the night, Pike tried to rouse Kendall's sympathies by playing to their mutual hatred of West. Pike proposed they kill Mueller and Nunez and persuade Dunbar and Castro to back them up. Kendall dismissed Pike's proposal and went back to his sleeping area. He later spotted Pike whispering to Dunbar. According to Kendall, Dunbar then went back to his bag, retrieved his pistol and aimed it at a sleeping Mueller. Kendall intervened and caused Mueller to shoot Castro. After Castro was hit, he fired frantically striking Nunez, Kendall and Pike. Nunez and Pike were killed, and Kendall was wounded. Dunbar then carried the wounded Kendall on his back through the jungle, exchanged fire with Mueller, and was picked up, as seen in the beginning of the movie. When asked why Dunbar would go through all the trouble of carrying him out of the jungle, Kendall suggests that perhaps Dunbar expected him to cover for him in gratitude for saving his life.\n\nHardy and Osborne confronts Dunbar with Kendall's revelations. An angry Dunbar claims that Kendall is lying and that he didn't shoot West. He also claims that Mueller and Castro were selling prescription drug injection kits called \"combat cocktails\" which help dull physical pain and sharpen the mind, and that Kendall was in on it. Hardy refuses Dunbar's drug story because he thinks Dunbar only said drugs to get Hardy's attention as a DEA agent. The argument leads to a fist fight and Hardy almost leaves the base angry with Osbourne trying to convince him to stay. However, their argument stops when Hardy remembers Dunbar's words about not shooting West. He realizes that, according to Kendall's story, West was not shot but hit with a phosphorus grenade. Hardy starts to believe Dunbar doesn't know how West really was killed. They return to Dunbar to listen to the rest of his story.\n\nDunbar explains that the grenade was used to lure West at a specific point where Mueller shot him because he was aware of their drug dealing. Mueller used Pike's grenade, which he had stolen from his pack earlier, to avoid suspicion. Back at the bunker, Mueller tried to pin the blame on Pike, but when Pike began pointing out evidence that threw suspicion on Mueller instead, a fierce argument began, Mueller lost his temper and shot Pike in the head. A firefight ensued and Castro and Nunez were killed. Dunbar rescued Kendall, hiked through the jungle, killed Mueller and was picked up by the helicopter.\n\nAt Osborne's request, Dunbar provides proof of the alleged drug-dealing operation. He also says that it was Vilmer who supplied the drugs to Mueller and Castro. When Osborne and Hardy return to the hospital, they speak briefly with Dr. Vilmer. After a short interrogation, during which Osborne breaks his nose with a phone book, Vilmer admits that he distributed to Mueller and Kendall and that he falsified drug tests so that the soldiers would come up clean. Vilmer is then placed under arrest. Styles accepts Dunbars and Vilmers confessions as enough to close the investigation. When Osbourne suggests that Kendall should be questioned further since he lied the first time, Styles orders them to stay away from Kendall considering his father's status.\n\nHardy and Osborne ignore the order and return to confront Kendall, who is acting odd and refuses to give them any useful information, even mocking them. He still claims that Dunbar is the guilty party. After a few minutes, Hardy notices that Kendall is bleeding out of his ears. Suddenly, Kendall starts vomiting blood and then abruptly dies. Right before Kendall dies he uses his blood soaked finger to draw the symbol for infinity in Osborne's hand.\n\nStyles is furious that Osborne and Hardy ignored his orders. He relieves Osborne of her duty and asks Hardy to leave. He informs them that Dunbar and Vilmer will be taken away shortly on the transport plane that has arrived from the U.S. and he considers the investigation closed. Osborne comments on Kendall's drawing in her hand when she realizes that he didn't draw the infinity symbol, but an 8. Remembering Dunbar's note which also had an 8, she shows this to Hardy, who first denies knowing what the 8 may symbolize. When she insists on pursuing her investigation even though they were just ordered to drop it, Hardy finally explains the conversation he had earlier with Styles about a rumored group of ex-Rangers in Panama, trained under West, who turned rogue and became drug-dealers. They call themselves Section 8. Osborne, mad at Hardy for not telling her sooner engages him in a fist fight that ends when Hardy tries to kiss her and she pulls her gun on him.\n\nAfter their scuffle, they return to the stockade where Vilmer, still in custody, remarks to Hardy and Osborne in an offhand manner that he will be on the same plane as Pike. Hardy corrects him, saying that he'll be on the same plane as Dunbar, but Vilmer says that's not right. He explains that Ray Dunbar is black. This means that the white \"Dunbar\" Hardy and Osborne have been questioning all night is in fact Pike, the man who West antagonized during training (according to his own story). Pike had switched his tags with Dunbar's in order to throw off the local authorities, then disappear after being transported for trial. The soldier files never specifies the soldier's ethnicity. Hardy and Osborne rush back to the base just as Pike is being taken onto a transport plane. Hardy grabs Pike and holds his face dangerously close to the plane's whirling propeller until Pike faints and drops to his knees. Afterwards, Hardy and Osborne lead Pike away to interrogate him again now that they know the truth.\n\nIn Pike's new story, West was not shot. Pike claimed West knew about the real operation going on at the base, cocaine smuggling. He claims West confronted the Rangers in the bunker and told them that he would turn them in to authorities in the morning and tell Styles everything. A brief Mexican standoff ensued, and West escaped the bunker. Nu\u00f1ez chased after him but got shot by West. Shortly after Castro and Mueller went looking for West. Later on, Pike and Kendall found Dunbar dead. West surprised them and shot Kendall, wounding him, and then tried to persuade Pike to surrender himself. Mueller then came out and managed to kill West. Pike shot at Mueller, and then, knowing that he would be blamed if West died, took Dunbar's dog tags. It is still thoroughly established that he managed to escape, carried Kendall through the jungle, killed Mueller and was picked up by the helicopter. To prove his story, he gives Hardy, Osborne and Styles, the number of a crate where Vilmer had stowed cocaine.\n\nSatisfied that they finally have their answers, Hardy and Styles retreat to Styles' office, unknowingly followed by Osborne who finds it odd that she was not invited to join them. Hardy tells Styles that he finds it odd that West didn't tell his colonel (Styles) about the drugs as soon as he suspected something. Hardy then accuses Styles of lying; he tells Styles that he believes West did in fact go to him, but that he was behind the drug trafficking operation the whole time. Rather than side with West, he ordered Mueller and Kendall to kill him and then poisoned Kendall afterward to keep him quiet. Styles laughs off the accusations, but as Hardy starts to leave, Styles offers him a percentage of the operation to keep his mouth shut, confirming he is indeed behind the whole drug operation. Hardy now understands why Styles called him to investigate. If he found anything, he could be easily discredited or bought. Hardy says he'll have to think about it and turns to leave. Styles draws his weapon to shoot Hardy but is shot and killed by Osborne who heard the whole exchange.\n\nAfter the Military Police wraps up the investigation into Styles' shooting, Hardy and Osborne have a coffee before they leave the base separately. Hardy tells Osborne not to worry about the charges and that she would be cleared. All she has to do is \"Tell the story right\". Osborne recalls hearing that same phrase during both Kendall and Pike's stories, particularly in describing how members of the conspiracy planned to cover up West's death. This makes Osborne suspect Hardy may be somehow involved, especially since he hated West and because Section 8 is rumored to contain many of West's former trainees. She tails him out of the base and watches as Pike suddenly runs out from some bushes and into Hardy's jeep.\n\nShe follows them by car and then by foot through the streets of Panama City and watches as the two of them enter a doorway with a big eight ball hanging over it. Osborne sneaks up behind Hardy and Pike, with her weapon drawn, believing that they are Section 8 and are responsible for West's murder. She confronts Hardy with her own theories but becomes very confused when West, very much alive and well, walks up behind her and sits at the table with Pike and Hardy. Castro, Dunbar and Nu\u00f1ez, also alive, come out of the kitchen and join them.\n\nThey reveal to Osbourne that Section 8 is in fact a special black-ops anti-drug unit led by Tom Hardy himself. The mercenary stories are used as a cover to spook the cartels. Dunbar, Castro, Nunez and Pike (all fake names) infiltrated the base to investigate the cocaine trafficking that was going on, and discovered that Mueller, Kendall and Vilmer were responsible. West, not realizing that Styles was also involved, informed him of their findings, although keeping their involvement a secret. Styles responded by ordering Mueller and Kendall to kill West. The training mission was a set-up to get rid of Mueller and Kendall, and fake West's death. West joined Section 8, and Hardy went to the base to confirm Styles' and Vilmer's involvement. West and Hardy then offer Osborne a job within their group. The movie ends when it is revealed that Tom Hardy is not a DEA agent and never left the army. He's in fact, a Colonel."

Upon learning from the man who blew the bomb, Jean allows Zoe to escape, realizing that the group will come to kill her.\n\nThe group tracks the location of Zoe's phone.

Meanwhile, Rafi's forces are planning to attack the bank.\n\nMason, Briar and Zoe head to the bank. Briar realizes that Gamieux killed Karen and discovers his corrupt plans. As the three arrive at the bank with the number of protestors gathered at the front of the bank, Briar poses as cops in order to infiltrate the bank while Mason and Zoe stay.

    "Bataan": "The film opens with long lines of tired and grim soldiers and civilians moving through a congested town away from the advancing Japanese (who are not shown but the hopelessness of the situation hangs heavy). Sergeant Bill Dane (Robert Taylor) of the 31st Infantry and his companion Corporal Jake Feingold (Thomas Mitchell) are seen manning a defensive position. They casually discuss the possibility that they will be ordered to retreat again back toward the presumed safety of Bataan.\n\nTheir commander orders them to report to a Captain Lassister for a special assignment. The town then suffers a violent Japanese air attack with civilians and soldiers caught in the open and killed. Dane and Feingold reach Lassiter. A pretty American nurse boards the last ambulance out while casting a long, soulful look back at Lassier (Lee Bowman). Lassiter puts Dane in charge of a group of 13 men, all of whom had been separated from their commands, with orders to hold a a strategic bridge after the last refugees cross. Lassiter makes it clear they are to demolish the bridge, stop the \"Japs\", and hold until MacArthur can consolidate in Bataan. They are given such equipment and supplies as is available and left alone.\n\nAfter the army and some civilians cross the bridge, Dane, Feingold, and a group of eleven hastily assembled soldiers from different units is assigned to blow it up and delay Japanese rebuilding efforts as long as possible. In addition to Sgt. Dane, Cpl. Feingold and Captain Lassier, the rear guard is a mixed lot, making up of:\n\nCorporal Barney Todd (Lloyd Nolan), who claims to be a signalman;\n\nPrivate Felix Ramirez (Desi Arnaz), a Mexican American California National Guardsman;\n\nPrivate Wesley Epps (Kenneth Lee Spencer), a black demolitions expert;\n\nPrivate Matthew Hardy (Phillip Terry), a conscientious objector in the Medical Corps;\n\nPrivate Francis X. Matowski (Barry Nelson), an engineer;\n\nPrivate \"Yankee\" Salazar (Alex Havier), a Philippine Scout;\n\nPrivate Sam Molloy (Tom Dugan), a cook;\n\nSeaman Leonard Purckett (Robert Walker), a naive young navy musician;\n\nArmy Air Corps Lt. Steve Bentley (George Marshall), a pilot;\n\nCorporal Juan Katigbak (Roque Espiritu), Bentley's Philippine mechanic.\n\nThe group sets up camp and firing positions on a cliff overlooking the bridge, blow the bridge, and settle down to wait for the Japanese. Following is several minutes of exposition which set the tone for the rest of the film. Quinine, food and ammo are in short supply. Dane establishes his credibility and toughness as Sgt. of the group. Bentley reveals that he is an Army AF pilot repairing his damaged plane, Todd is soon revealed to be a prickly bully who clashes with everyone. Dane suspects Todd is using an alias and may be the man who seven years earlier murdered a young private in a barracks card fight and ruined Dane's army officer career in the process. Todd is evasive and Dane elects not to push the issue.\n\nThe Japanese move up and work at night on the bridge. The Americans talk, eat, sit by their weapons, and wait. The calm is interrupted when an unseen sniper catches Capt Lassiter in the open and shoots him dead with a bullet through his head. Purckett wants to play taps at the burial but Dane angrily orders him not to - explaining that the Japs know taps and will start counting the dead. At the burial it is sadly revealed that Lassiter had recently married the nurse seen on the ambulance.\n\nThat night, Ramirez finds a battery powered radio and tunes in the Tommy Dorsey band live from Hollywood. The aching contrast between these familiar sounds of home and their own isolation and mortal peril is not lost on the men or the viewer. Dane orders Matowski to climb a tree and report on enemy movement. He carelessly shows himself, is shot by a sniper, and falls with a blood curdling scream to his death.\n\nThe next day Dane and Todd go out alone, hurl grenades at the bridge, and blow it up one more time. Dane notes that Todd throws left handed like the murderer of seven years ago but again doesn't push the issue. Alone with Feingold afterwards, Dane begins to question whether he and the men will break from the strain and run, but the brave Feingold calmly assures him they will do their duty to the end.\n\nIn succession, more men die as the Japanese pressure increases. Their Phillipino guide tries to break through the Japanese lines and get to Bataan for help, is captured, tortured and strung up for the Americans to see. Ramirez dies of malaria, Malloy is killed in a strafing air attack.\n\nBentley repairs his plane and attempts to fly out under cover of night. They succeed, but Katigbak is killed (with a samurai sword one night) and Bentley is mortally wounded when he tries to lift off in his airplane. He asks Dane to load two boxes of dynamite on the plane. Dane refuses until Bentley pulls rank and orders him to do it. In a last dying act, Bentley flies into the bridge and demolishes it in a tremendous explosion.\n\nThe remaining soldiers repel a massive frontal assault, inflicting grievous losses on the attacking Japanese troops, ultimately fighting hand-to-hand with bayonets fixed on their M1903 Springfield rifles. Epps and Feingold are killed. Only Dane, Todd and a wounded Purckett are left.\n\nPurckett is shot by an another unseen Japanese sniper, and Todd stabbed in the back by a Japanese soldier who had only feigned being dead. Before he dies, Todd admits to Dane that he is Burns.\n\nNow alone, Dane stoically digs his own marked grave beside those of his fallen comrades and waits in it. The Japanese troops crawl close to his position before opening fire and charging at Dane. Dane fires back, yelling, \"We're still here.....we'll always be here, why don't you come and get us!\" When his Tommy gun runs out of ammunition, he continues firing with the heavy machine gun as the Japanese close in on him.... the machine gun points to the audience as the final credits roll (rather then showing his death at the hands of the Japanese).\n\nThe end story board states that the sacrifice of the defenders of Bataan helped slow the Japanese down, making possible America's later victories in the Pacific War."

    "Batla House": "ACP Sanjay Kumar (John Abraham) is informed that his team has cornered 5 university students in L-18, Batla House, who might have been involved in the 2008 serial bombings, the responsibility for which was claimed by the terrorist organization \"Indian Mujahideen\" (IM). Sanjay orders not to engage until he arrives, but a restless K.K. (Ravi Kishan) proceeds with some officers. Sanjay arrives and upon hearing the gunshots, decides to engage. The building is cleared, and K.K. is found shot down. Sanjay enters the room and there's more shooting, as a result of which 2 students end up dead, 2 escape and 1 is arrested alive. Sanjay now starts facing the heat from media and politicians who start billing the encounter as a fake one. They're joined by the whole nation in condemning the Delhi Police and everyone starts demanding justice for the students who were supposedly killed to account for the bombings. Sanjay's wife Nandita (Mrunal Thakur), a news anchor, is however unwilling to accept this and decides to stay with Sanjay, who soon becomes diagnosed with Posttraumatic stress disorder, frequently hallucinating about getting shot by the terrorists. Nandita somehow stops him whenever he becomes suicidal.\n\nSanjay now starts looking for the 2 terrorists that escaped, and finds one of them to hiding in Nizampur. Sanjay is informed by his senior that he would be awarded for the encounter and that he must celebrate. Realizing he's not been told where to celebrate, he heads to Nizampur where he manages to find Dilshad, one of the fugitives. Everyone tries to stop Sanjay, who chases, beats up and almost arrests Dilshad, only to be cornered by the politicians and public who let him escape but without Dilshad. After being awarded the President Medal, Sanjay begins his hunt again (His boss tells Sanjay to be smart and not return to Nizampur but to lure Dilshad out) and this time, through Dilshad's girlfriend Huma (Nora Fatehi), tricks him into coming to Nepal (after conducting surveillance on Dilshad for many weeks and knowing everything about his relationship with Huma). Dilshad is planning to leave for Dubai via Nepal (and plans to take Huma with him) and Sanjay plans to nab him in Nepal by using Huma. He knows that Huma is an illegal Russian immigrant and threatens to deport her, unless she delivers Dilshad to him.\n\nHuma tells Sanjay how Dilshad is expecting a call from Dubai. So Sanjay gets his colleague to call (pretending to be from Dubai) instead and give instructions for pickup in Nepal. He teams up with his officers once again, and sends a van to pick up Dilshad, as a part of his plan. The latter, however, sends someone else to check for anything suspicious. Sanjay runs to stop his officers from engaging upon realizing Dilshad's not in the van and lets it flee. Learning of nothing suspicious, Dilshad informs the van driver he'd depart the next day, and upon landing in Nepal, is stopped, thrashed and arrested by Sanjay and his team.\n\nThe court proceedings begin, where the opposing lawyer (Rajesh Sharma) brings up arguments to counter Sanjay's truth and creates a fake encounter story, as per which K.K. and his men brought the students in L18, tortured and decided to kill them when they were ordered not to do so, following which K.K. was shot by one of his officers. The lawyer also proves that nobody except the dead KK actually saw Dilshad escape from the apartment where the shootout took place. Sanjay, however, brings out the truth that actually his officers had been closely watching the students and realized they belonged to the Indian Mujahideen. The real shootout then plays out, showcasing K.K. and his team engaging when the students fire, and the very fact that K.K. died gives Sanjay's argument a strong support when he tells everyone that no officer has ever died in a fake encounter. His arguments convince the court to sentence the 2 terrorists to life imprisonment, while the last one somehow escapes the country.\n\nWhile sections of the media still oppose the ruling and believe the police to be culprits, a video clip that surfaced in 2016 featured a confession from the terrorist who had escaped the encounter, about he managed to do so and later join the ISIS, further confirming the credibility of the encounter."

    "Batman": "The mayor of Gotham City orders District Attorney Harvey Dent (Billy Dee Williams) and Police Commissioner James Gordon (Pat Hingle) to increase police activity and combat crime in preparation for the city's bicentennial. Reporter Alexander Knox (Robert Wuhl) and photojournalist Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) begin to investigate reports of a vigilante nicknamed \"Batman\", who is targeting the city's criminals.\n\nMob boss Carl Grissom (Jack Palance), who has already been targeted by Dent, discovers his mistress (Jerry Hall) is involved with his second-in-command, Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson). With the help of corrupt policeman Max Eckhardt (William Hootkins), Grissom sets up Napier to be murdered during a raid at the Axis Chemicals plant. During the ensuing shootout, Napier kills Eckhardt, after which Batman suddenly appears. The two struggle, and Napier is accidentally knocked into a vat of chemical waste. Batman flees, and Napier is thought to be dead.\n\nBatman is in actuality Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton), a billionaire industrialist who, as a child, witnessed his parents' murder at the hands of a mugger. Bruce meets and falls for Vicki at a fundraiser, and the two begin a relationship. Meanwhile, Napier survives the accident, but is horribly disfigured with chalk-white skin, emerald-green hair and a permanent ruby-red grin. Driven insane by his reflection, he reinvents himself as \"the Joker\", kills Grissom and usurps his criminal empire.\n\nThe Joker begins to spread terror in the city, first by lacing hygiene products with a deadly chemical known as \"Smilex\", which causes victims to laugh to death when used in certain combinations. The Joker then sets a trap at the Gotham Museum of Art for Vicki, and he and his henchmen vandalize the surrounding works of art. Batman arrives and rescues Vicki, and the pair escape in the Batmobile. Batman gives information about Smilex to Vicki so she can warn the city via Gotham newspapers about the poisoned products.\n\nBruce meets with Vicki at her apartment, prepared to tell her that he is Batman. They are interrupted by the Joker, who asks Bruce, \"Have you ever danced with the devil by the pale moonlight?\" before shooting him. Bruce, who was wearing body armor, escapes, and recollects that the man who killed his parents asked him the same question; he realizes that the Joker killed his parents. Vicki suddenly appears in the Batcave, having been let in by Bruce's butler, Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Gough). After avouching himself to Vicki, Bruce-as Batman-leaves to destroy the Axis Chemical plant. Meanwhile, the Joker lures the townspeople to a nighttime parade with a promise to give away $20 million in cash. When the citizens arrive, however, he attacks them with Smilex gas spewing it from his giant parade balloons. Batman arrives on the scene and saves Gotham City from the attack using the Batwing, but the Joker kidnaps Vicki and takes her to the top of a cathedral.\n\nBatman pursues the two, and at the top of the dusty edifice, he and the Joker confront each other in single combat. When the Joker attempts an escape via a helicopter, Batman grapples the Joker's leg to a heavy stone sculpture, causing him to fall to his death. Commissioner Gordon unveils the Bat-Signal along with a note from Batman read by Harvey Dent, promising to defend Gotham whenever crime strikes again."

    "Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero": "The film begins in an animated title sequence in which a Batman emblem revolves out of an icy cavern before being frozen by a freeze ray, bringing the title \"Sub-Zero\" into place.\n\nTwo Polar Bears, Notchka and Shaka, are shown swimming underwater. They are joined by a swimming Dr. Victor Fries who spears salmon. The three journey to Mr. Freeze's home in the Arctic where they meet Mr. Freeze's adopted Inuit son, Koonak. Mr. Freeze then brings a flower he found in the snow to his wife Nora Fries, sleeping in a cryogenic tank. Fries tells Koonak that his wife must be kept in cryogenic sleep until a cure to her terminal illness can be found. Suddenly, a submarine of explorers breaks through the ice below them and causes the tank to spill over and break open. Several explorers leave the submarine to investigate. They return to the cave sometime later to see the entire crew frozen into a huge wall of ice in terror. Just then, Fries appears as Mr. Freeze and freezes them to death as well.\n\nTwo Weeks later in Gotham City, Batman and Robin stop a jewel theft and appear at a gala as their alter egos, Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson. At the party, blue-eyed Dr. Gregory Belson confronts his stockbroker Dean Abergast about his investment which has fallen through. Abergast explains he is unable to help Belson in his current predicament, and Belson storms off. As he drives off in the sweltering weather, the road ahead of him becomes a snowy ice dome, which causes his car to collide into an ice wall. He is confronted by an approaching Mr. Freeze who states that he has a patient who needs Belson's attention.\n\nAt the current gala, Barbara Gordon arrives after stopping a domestic assault as Batgirl. She and Dick Grayson meet and agree to go to the Coast that weekend together. On his way home, Bruce and Alfred find their car stuck in a gigantic water puddle which had once been the ice dome. They find Belson's abandoned car. Dr. Gregory Belson, a former colleague of Freeze, studies Nora's injuries and conditions and discovers that there are no deceased organ donors for the tissue samples she needs to survive. Freeze insists that they find a live donor if that is the case. Belson only agrees to the promise of more gold from a vein Freeze discovered in the Arctic. They then discover that Barbara is the only live donor with a perfect match for Nora.\n\nFreeze arrives at a restaurant with his polar bears that Barbara Gordon and Dick are partying at. Freeze threatens some people with his bears until Barbara hands herself in to him. Dick tries to intervene, but despite his attempts, Freeze escapes with Barbara. Freeze takes Barbara to his secret hiding place on an abandoned oil rig. Belson approaches her as she awakens and tries to put her to sleep via pills but she stops him and escapes through a vent where she finds herself in a stasis room in which she discovers the hibernating Nora Fries. She confronts both Freeze and Belson as they approach, and agrees to give the \"blood transfusion\" in a public hospital, which Freeze denies. Barbara is captured by them and locked in a cell. Back in Gotham city, Gordon works tirelessly to find his daughter with the Gotham City Police Department. Bruce Wayne does his own investigating and discovers that Barbara's organs are a perfect match with Nora Freeze via the hospital's donor files.\n\nBruce and Dick discover that Dr. Gregory Belson is also missing and they confront Belson's broker, Dean Abergast who tells them that Belson was doing some investing in a new medical drug that fell through, explaining his need for cash and collaboration with Freeze. Midway through the confession, Abergast receives a telephone call by Belson explaining that he will have money soon to pay off his debts. Batman and Robin discover that in the conversation that the location was somewhere around the sea from a ships horn. When the time for the operation comes, Barbara befriends Koonak who reveals that Freeze is not a monster but is concerned for Barbara's well-being. Koonak asks Freeze if they will not hurt Barbara, which Freeze lies about, promising she will be alright. However, as Barbara is being tied down and anesthesia is about to be put in her, Koonak fights Freeze and Belson indignant that Freeze lied. Barbara and Koonak flee with an enraged Belson pursuing them.\n\nBatman and Robin arrive in the Batwing and park the craft on the landing pad of the rig. Belson fires at Barbara with a hidden revolver and accidentally starts a fire which rapidly spreads across the rig. Freeze demands that Belson catch Barbara and conduct the operation but Belson refuses and betrays Freeze, attempting to flee on a raft. After dodging flames and falling debris as well as Freeze's bears, Batman and Robin rescue Nora with the help of Freeze. Robin starts up the Batwing and inadvertently cause the platform to fall apart and crash down upon Belson and his raft, crushing and killing him. Flaming debris falls upon Freeze and breaks his leg. Batman rushes to rescue Freeze by Freeze's helmet is cracked open by falling debris, exposing his sensitive face to heat as he falls from Batman's grappling cord into the water below. Batman, Robin, Barbara, and Koonak escape in the Batwing, gravely watching the rig go up in flames. As they fly off into the skies, the two polar bears begin swimming off, as Freeze's hand breaks out of the waves and clutches one of the polar bears.\n\nSometime later, in a research base in the Antarctica, two men watch a television in which it is reported that Nora Fries was given the medical organ treatment she needed funded by Wayne Enterprises and is revived, now living peacefully in Gotham. Freeze appears outside the base, watching this through the window. He smiles and cries tears of joy. He turns and limps away with his leg bound in an ice cast. With the rest of the world believing him dead, Freeze goes on to living peacefully in the Arctic. He is last seen disappearing into a blizzard accompanied by his polar bears."

The super-criminal freezes Robin and flees, notifying Batman that he has 11 minutes to thaw his partner. They learn that Freeze was once scientist Victor Fries, who became dependent on a diamond-powered subzero suit following an accident in a cryogenics lab he was occupying to find a cure for his wife, Nora, who was suffering from a terminal illness called MacGregor's Syndrome.\n\nNora has now been Cryo frozen by Victor, who is hoping to continue his research to develop a cure for her disease. Victor plans to freeze the entire Gotham city so as to demand the billions of dollars required to complete his research.\n\nMeanwhile, botanist Dr. Pamela Isley (Uma Thurman) is experimenting with the strength serum \"Venom\" to create mutant plants capable of fighting back against mankind's destruction of flora. To her anger, she discovers that her senior colleague Dr. Jason Woodrue used her Venom samples to transform a diminutive prisoner into the \"super soldier\" Bane. When she refuses to become the mad scientist's partner, Woodrue kills her with animal-plant toxins and chemicals. She transforms into the beautiful Poison Ivy and kills Woodrue with a venomous kiss before vowing to use her new powers to establish botanical supremacy over the world. Alfred Pennyworth's niece Barbara Wilson (Alicia Silverstone) makes a surprise visit from England and is invited to stay at Wayne Manor until she returns to university. Alfred is revealed to be suffering from MacGregor's Syndrome.\n\nIvy arrives in Gotham City with Bane as her henchman. She interrupts a Wayne Enterprises press conference at the Gotham Observatory where a giant new telescope is being unveiled, exhorting Bruce Wayne to implement a proposal that would safeguard the natural environment at the expense of millions of human lives, which Bruce summarily declines.

He eventually goes to meet her at her garden hide-out. Ivy's venomous kiss fails to kill Robin because Batman had prevailed on him to coat his lips with rubber. She tries to drown Robin in her lily pond and entangles Batman in her crushing vines, although they are able to free themselves when Batgirl arrives and traps Ivy in her own floral throne. Having discovered the Batcave and decided to create her own crime-fighting persona with Alfred's help, Batgirl reveals herself as Barbara.\n\nWhen the Trio arrive at the Observatory to stop Freeze, the criminal has already frozen Gotham.

He vows that Freeze will be allowed to continue his research at Arkham Asylum to heal Nora. Batman asks Freeze for the cure he created for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome for Alfred and Freeze atones for his misdeeds by giving him two vials of the medicine he had developed.\n\nAt Arkham, Ivy is joined in her cell by Freeze, who vows to exact revenge on her. Back at Wayne Manor, Alfred is cured and Bruce invites Barbara to live with them and continue helping him and Dick fight crime as Batgirl."

    "Batman Begins": "As a child, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) falls into an abandoned well filled with bats, causing him to develop a phobia, and later witnesses his parents' murder at the hands of mugger Joe Chill. Years later, Chill is granted parole in exchange for agreeing to testify against crime boss Carmine Falcone.\n\nBruce, now a young man, goes to the courthouse intending to shoot Chill, but one of Falcone's assassins does so first. Bruce confides in his childhood friend Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), now a Gotham City district attorney, who is disgusted by Bruce's desire for vengeance. Bruce leaves Gotham to learn the ways of the criminal underworld, in hopes of learning skills that will allow him to return to Gotham and free it from the crime and corruption that threatens to consume it. In a Bhutanese prison, he meets Ducard, who offers to train him as a ninja of the League of Shadows led by Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe). While making the difficult journey to Ra's' monastery at the top of a nearby mountain range, he picks a strange blue flower which is used later in a test as an hallucinogen to force him to face his greatest fear. As he completes his training, Bruce learns of the League's true intentions: to liberate Gotham from the evils that plague it by destroying the city. He burns down the League's temple, killing Ra's, while saving the life of Ducard.\n\nBruce returns to Gotham. While publicly posing as a reckless playboy, he takes an interest in his family's company, Wayne Enterprises, a technology and defense conglomerate run by the unscrupulous CEO William Earle, who intends to take the company public. Bruce meets Lucius Fox, head of the Applied Sciences division, who introduces him to several of Wayne's experimental prototype technologies, including an armored car, the \"Tumbler\" and protective bodysuit, which Bruce uses to create his crime-fighting persona, Batman. As Batman, Bruce uses sophisticated surveillance equipment to spy on Falcone's meetings and illegal smuggling operations in the city. He uses his fearsome persona in costume to interrogate a corrupt detective, Flass (Mark Boone Jr) about the drug shipments. Batman intercepts an illegal drug shipment and turns the captured Falcone over to Sgt. Jim Gordon and the Gotham police. Meanwhile, a Wayne Enterprises cargo ship is raided and an experimental weapon is stolen, a \"Microwave Emitter\" that uses microwaves to vaporize an enemy's water supply.\n\nBack in Gotham, Falcone and his henchmen are declared mentally unfit for trial and transferred to Arkham Asylum by the corrupt Dr. Jonathan Crane, who had been using Falcone to import a dangerous hallucinogenic drug, synthesized from the odd blue flower Ducard had charge Bruce with retrieving in Bhutan, that causes severe psychosis. Crane exposes Falcone to the toxin while wearing a burlap mask, driving Falcone mad with fear of the \"Scarecrow.\" While investigating Crane, Batman is also exposed to the drug and is rescued by Alfred and given an antidote by Fox. Rachel goes to Arkham, where Crane reveals that he has been dumping the toxin into Gotham's water supply before dosing her with it. She is rescued by Batman, who sprays Crane himself with the toxin and interrogates him. Crane reveals that he's been working for Ra's al Ghul, an epiphany that Batman finds impossible. Batman fights a SWAT team sent to capture him and escapes Arkham with Rachel, whose mind is fading quickly. In the Tumbler, Batman blasts through the police force sent to trap him. He takes Rachel to his lair, inoculates her and gives her two vials of the antidote, one for Sgt. Gordon and one for mass production. Back at Arkham, Gordon and his investigative team find that Crane's men have been dumping the toxin into the city's water supply for weeks, however it hasn't affected the population yet because it needs to be inhaled to take effect.\n\nAt his 30th birthday celebration at Wayne Manor, Bruce is confronted by Ducard, who reveals himself to be the real Ra's Al Ghul. Bruce fakes a drunken tirade to get rid of his guests, leaving him alone with Ra's and his ninjas. Ra's reveals the League's plan to destroy Gotham: having stolen the Microwave Emitter and conspired with Crane, they intend to vaporize the city's toxin-riddled water supply, creating mass hysteria and violence. The League sets fire to the mansion and Bruce is nearly trapped inside but is saved by Alfred.\n\nAs the League begins unleashing the toxin they also release dozens of Arkham's most dangerous inmates. Batman rescues Rachel from a toxin-induced mob and reveals his true identity to her. He entrusts Sgt. Gordon with the Tumbler and pursues Ra's, who is using Gotham's train system to deliver the weapon throughout the city. Batman confronts Ra's on the train and escapes just as Gordon uses the new Batmobile to destroy the elevated tracks, leaving Ra's to die in the ensuing crash.\n\nBatman becomes a public hero, but simultaneously loses Rachel, who cannot bring herself to love both Bruce and Batman. Bruce buys a controlling stake in the now publicly-traded Wayne Enterprises, fires Earle, and replaces him with Fox. Jim Gordon is promoted to Lieutenant. He shows Batman the new Bat-Signal and mentions a new costumed criminal who leaves Joker cards at crime scenes. Batman promises to investigate, and disappears into the night."

    "Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker": "Late one night in future Gotham, several members of the infamous Jokerz gang - Bonk (Henry Rollins), Chucko (Don Harvey), Woof (Don Harvey), a human spliced with hyena DNA, Ghoul (Michael Rosenbaum), and the Dee-Dee twins, Delia and Deidre, (Melissa Joan Hart) - break into a warehouse full of high-tech equipment. They attempt to use a hovercraft to move one large piece of machinery but are quickly confronted by Batman (Will Friedle). The gang flees and an air chase ensues over Gotham, resulting in the destruction of the machinery and the gang's hasty escape.\n\nBack in the Batcave, an elderly Bruce Wayne (Kevin Conroy) practices throwing a Batarang to keep his remaining skills sharp. The aerial Batmobile returns and Bruce's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Terry McGinnis, confirms that he was able to stop the Jokerz from taking what they sought but admits that he doesn't know why. Since the same gang of Jokerz has been stealing high-tech equipment several times over the past month, Bruce suspects that they are acting as fences for the stolen goods. A news report flashes on the TV announcing Bruce's plans to take control of Wayne Enterprises after years of absence. The majority of the company is happy about the return of their founder but one board member, Jordan Price (Mark Hamill) is bitter about the transition since he was next in line, after the departure of Derek Powers (Sherman Howard), for the chief position. Having finished his patrols, Terry leaves to go out with his girlfriend, Dana (Lauren Tom) at a night club but soon dozes off from exhaustion.\n\nThe Jokerz gang returns to their hideout to face their mysterious boss who berates them for their failure to procure the latest gear. Bonk is no less pleased with the situation and accuses their employer of tricking them into stealing for no apparent purpose or payout before he insinuates that the man is not who he says he is. The darkened figure pulls out a gun and pulls the trigger, making Bonk flinch, but all that comes out is a banner with BANG written on it. However, with a second flex of the finger, the BANG flag shoots out and impales Bonk, killing him. His identity no longer a secret, the original Clown Prince of Crime, the Joker (Mark Hamill), stands and makes the other Jokerz swear their allegiance. Ghoul uses a computer to find another source for their missing materials. The Joker spots one entry on the list and points it out, noting that he thinks it will be 'fun'.\n\nThe next night, Bruce and Terry attend a function for Wayne Enterprises celebrating Bruce's return on the roof of one of the company buildings. As Bruce begins giving a speech to the crowd, the microphone cuts out and the speakers erupt with the sound of the Joker's trademark laugh. Terry finds a moment in the confusion to find shelter and change into his Batman suit as Woof appears in the crowd and sends people into a panic. Dee-Dee startles Bruce on stage just as a shock rocks the platform and a plume of smoke obscures everything. Bruce is knocked to the ground as a panel rises on the stage and a figure emerges. Bruce's eyes widen in horror as he recognizes the apparent return of his greatest foe; the Joker.\n\nBatman arrives and puts himself between the Joker and Bruce. Joker is hardly impressed with the new Batman and even critiques his suit before fleeing. He tosses a few hapless people off the edge of the roof as he makes his escape, forcing Batman to rescue them instead of continuing his pursuit. Later, Terry returns to Bruce and, as they drive away, beats himself over his failure to stop the Joker. Bruce reassures Terry and tells him he did the right thing. Terry wonders how the Joker, after all these years, could still be around. Curious, and receiving no immediate information from a clearly shaken Bruce. In another part of Gotham, a middle-aged man named Tim sees a news report on the Joker's re-appearance and is horrified.\n\nTerry visits Commissioner Barbara Gordon (Angie Harmon), formerly Batgirl, to learn more about the Joker. However, she refuses to tell him much of anything. She meets with Tim as Terry leaves.\n\nThe following night in the Batcave, Bruce analyzes the night's events and compares voice samples from the Joker's latest appearance with those from his earlier encounters. They prove to be an exact match. Bruce remarks to Terry that it still isn't possible that the Joker has returned since he died more than forty years ago. Terry asks if he's sure, to which Bruce states that 'he was there'. Terry theorizes that Bruce himself, as Batman, killed the Joker but only because he had no other choice. Otherwise, something truly terrible would have happened. Bruce doesn't answer but tells Terry to return his Batsuit. He feels that Terry has done enough for the city and cannot be burdened to do any more. Terry objects, saying that he feels being Batman helps to amend for past sins and insists that the life of Batman is the one he wants. Bruce becomes impatient and insults Terry, calling him a 'stupid kid' who knows nothing of what he wants. Terry storms out in anger, leaving the suit behind.\n\nThe next morning, Terry gets up to have breakfast with his mother, Mary (Teri Garr), and his young brother, Matt (Ryan O'Donohue), who are both shocked to see Terry up so early given his normal late-night schedule. Terry admits he no longer works for Mr. Wayne.\n\nThat night, Dana is happy to see that Terry is more energetic and able to spend time with her and give her his full attention. Terry is equally glad until he is approached by two blonde girls - the Dee-Dee twins. The Jokerz gang appears on the dance floor and attack Terry.\n\nMeanwhile, at the Batcave, Bruce is examining a chemical mixer when he is attacked by a gas bomb. The Joker emerges out of the shadows, surprisingly aware of whom Bruce really is.\n\nTerry manages to fight off the Jokerz gang at the club, but Dana is injured in the struggle. When paramedics arrive and assure Terry that Dana will recover, he speeds off towards Wayne manor. He knows that the Jokerz would have no reason to attack him so publicly unless they had very good reason to. He calls Bruce and receives no response. At the manor, Terry finds Bruce's dog, Ace, injured and races inside to find the old man. He enters the Batcave to see Joker graffiti sprayed all over the walls, a haunting reminder of the night his father was murdered. He finds Bruce sprawled on the ground of the Batcave, a horrible grin etched on his face. Despite his infected state, and barely conscious, Bruce directs Terry to a supply of the Joker venom antidote he'd been working on before the attack. Terry quickly administers the antidote.\n\nThe next day, Barbara watches over Bruce as he slowly recovers from the toxin while Terry releases a cover story to Wayne Enterprises that Bruce suffered a bad fall and will not be able to take control of the company just yet. Afterwards, Terry meets up with Barbara and presses her for information. Finally, Barbara relents and starts at the beginning:\n\nNigh on forty years ago, Barbara lived the life of Batgirl, part of the family that comprised of Bruce as Batman and young Tim Drake (Mathew Valencia) as Robin, Dick Grayson, the original Robin, had become Nightwing and moved to another city. One night, while Robin was on patrol alone, he came upon what he thought was a damsel in distress. The woman turns out to be none other than Harley Quinn (Arleen Sorkin), accomplice and lover of the Joker. Harley knocks Robin out and kidnaps him. For three weeks, Batgirl and Batman search the city for Robin until they come upon an obvious Joker booby trap. The 'gift box' erupts, leaving evidence that points Batman to the remains of Arkham Asylum, long since abandoned due to a relocation. They enter the asylum where the Joker and Harley welcome them in a grim scene resembling a casual family outing. They introduce the newest member to their 'family', their 'son' Joker Junior - Tim. Dressed in a suit matching the Joker's and wearing a freakish smile on his pale face, Tim is clearly brainwashed by the Joker's toxins. In a fury, Batman attacks the Joker while Batgirl pursues Harley. Batgirl and Harley fight in the rusted upper levels of the asylum and Batgirl demands to know why Harley allowed the Joker to do such a thing. Harley admits that they 'roughed' Tim up a bit, but she'll make it right. Batgirl is unmoved. Harley is then knocked into a crevasse and, before Batgirl can pull her back up, loses her grip and falls into darkness.\n\nMeanwhile, the Joker flees further into the asylum and begins to play 'home movies' on a large projector screen in the facility's former operating room for Batman to watch. Joker darkly narrates how he first captured Robin and tortured him until his will broke, at which point he began to share secrets. Joker calls Bruce by his name and admits that he finds it rather pathetic that Batman is, after all, merely a 'little boy in a playsuit crying for Mommy and Daddy'. When the projection ends, Joker ambushes Batman and slashes his chest with a knife before stabbing him in the leg and knocking him hard to the floor. Joker stands over Batman and tosses a gun to Tim who is standing nearby. Tim aims the gun at Batman and Joker encourages him to finish him. Tim pulls the trigger, laughing maniacally, and a BANG flag pops out. Batman begs to Tim, calling him by his name, as Joker becomes impatient. Tim's face twitches despite his laughter and he quickly re-aims the gun and pulls the trigger. The BANG flag shoots out, launching into the Joker's chest and knocking him back. He coughs blood and mutters, \"That's not funny,\" before dying. Tim's laughter then succumbs to tears as Batgirl returns. She comforts Tim before they all leave together.\n\nCompleting her story, Barbara explains to Terry that the Joker was buried beneath Arkham, Harley's body was never found, and Tim spent over a year with a friend, Dr. Leslie Thompkins, while his mind recovered, though he never again took up the mantle as the Boy Wonder, as Bruce could no longer allow Tim to be Robin, as Bruce, in turn, vowed to never endanger another partner. Barbara herself left the Dark Knight's company later on and relations between the three of them have never been the same. Tim is now a communications engineer and seems to be doing fine.\n\nSuspicious of Tim's current mental state, Terry takes the Batsuit back and decides to examine him in stealth. However, he is spotted right away due to Tim's years of training with the elder Batman. Tim swears that he has put his old life behind him and is less than nostalgic about his life as Robin. Regardless of his suspicions, Terry follows a secondary theory in Jordan Price, knowing that he harbors resentment against Bruce. He finds Price on his yacht surrounded by the Jokerz gang. Batman confronts them and Price admits that he gave the gang clearance so that they could steal goods from the factory but knows nothing about the attempt on Wayne's life. The Jokerz then reveal that they've been assigned to kill Price in order to 'tie up loose ends'. Batman saves Price as his yacht explodes from a localized beam of energy from above while the Jokerz escape once more. On shore, Batman gives Price to police along with a recording proving his involvement with the Jokerz. Price is taken into custody.\n\nIn the Batcave, a recovered Bruce sits with Ace at the computer, sullen over his inability to piece anything together. Terry confronts him and claims that the 'real' Batman would have recalled something to solve the case by now but Bruce claims that things are rarely that simple. He admits that he did not want Terry to end up like Tim; bitter, which is why he asked for the suit back. As they argue, Terry suddenly notices that, among the items in the cave smashed from the Joker's attack, only the Robin suit was shredded beyond recognition. Adding that to the fact that everything the Jokerz gang had stolen is consistent with communications software leads Terry's suspicions all the more to Tim as the answer behind the Joker's true identity. Following more research, Terry and Bruce discover that the stolen items could create a satellite defense system which Terry realizes was responsible for the spontaneous destruction of Price's yacht.\n\nBruce instructs Terry to suit up and investigate. Terry requests one more weapon for his arsenal: Ace.\n\nBatman confronts Tim again at the local research station but finds that he is nothing more than a hologram. As the image disappears, the Joker communicates with Batman, seemingly confirming Terry's theory, and activates the satellite defense laser, destroying the station. Batman and Ace barely manage to outrun the laser with the Batmobile. After tracing down the Joker's headquarters, Batman engages the residing Jokerz gang one on one, with Ace helping to fight against the animalistic Woof. Having subdued the gang, Batman goes further inside and finds the real Tim who appears confused and unsure of how he got there. Batman becomes impatient with Tim's behavior and calls him out on working for the Joker. Tim suddenly suffers a flashback of killing the Joker and falls into a state of panic. Batman offers to call an ambulance, but Tim insists that he is fine, calling Batman 'Terry'. Shocked that Tim would know his true identity, Terry falters as Tim attacks and restrains him, telling him to stick around so that he won't miss the show.\n\nTim then undergoes a transformation where he is revealed to be the Joker himself! Joker explains to a shocked Terry and Bruce that, while Tim was under his wing, he was also part of a breakthrough genetic experiment. The Joker implanted a microchip into the back of Tim's head where the Joker's DNA was essentially implanted; leading to Tim's transformation into a clone of the Clown Prince, all while remaining unaware. The Joker powers up the satellite defense system again and happily lists a few possible targets: the hospital where Dana is recovering, the park where Terry's mother and brother are, and Wayne Manor. Not intimidated by Batman's threats, the Joker remains confident that he knows everything the old Batman and Robin knew at the top of their game and is thus one step ahead. But Batman asserts that the Joker doesn't know a thing about him. Ace then appears and attacks Joker, giving Batman time to escape. Bruce gives Terry some tips about the Joker; that he is very vain and likes to talk and not to let him get into Terry's head. Terry then comes up with an idea; he likes to talk too.\n\nHiding in the rafters, Batman calls out to Joker and insults him, calling him less than a comedian and berating his unoriginal jokes. He surmises that the reason the Joker got such a kick out of teasing the original Batman was because he could never get a laugh out of him. He then starts laughing. This quickly infuriates the Joker who launches several bombs into the rafters, damaging the control system for the satellite in the process and re-aiming the beam onto the factory itself. Joker manages to knock Batman out of the ceiling and pins him down, choking him. He laughs in his face and maniacally begs one more laugh out of him. Batman manages to choke out a \"ha-ha\" as he takes an electric hand buzzer and zaps the microchip on the back of the Joker's neck, destroying it and whatever essence of the Joker was in Tim. Back to his old self, Tim collapses. Batman collects him and Ace and escapes the factory just before the satellite beam destroys it.\n\nLater, the Dee-Dee twins are released from jail on bond into the custody of their grandmother who beats them over the head, calling them ungrateful. The girls leave with her, calling her Nana Harley.\n\nThe next day, Terry visits Tim in the hospital with Barbara. Tim thanks Terry for saving his life and notes that he is a fine successor to Bruce as Batman. As Terry leaves, Bruce appears in the doorway and makes peace with Tim.\n\nThat night, Terry dons the Batsuit once more, vowing to continue the legacy."

    "Batman Forever": "In Gotham City, Batman saves a guard from Two-Face, the alter ego of the disfigured former district attorney, Harvey Dent (Tommy Lee Jones). They are locked in a safe tied to a helicopter, where it is filled with acid. Using the security guard's hearing aid, Batman (Val Kilmer) unlocks the safe. Dent kills the helicopter's pilot and both Dent and Batman flee from the ensuing explosion on the Statue of Liberty. Meanwhile, Wayne Enterprises researcher Edward Nygma (Jim Carrey), develops a device to beam television directly to a person's brain. Bruce Wayne rejects the invention on the grounds that such intrusive technology raises too many questions and Nygma's supervisor attempts to terminate the project. Nygma tests the machine on his supervisor, kills him and resigns from his position, leaving a riddle behind.\n\nBruce meets psychiatrist Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman) and invites her to a charity circus event. There, Two-Face and his henchmen storm the event in an attempt to discover Batman's secret identity; in the process, a family of acrobats called The Flying Graysons are killed by Two-Face. Their youngest member, Dick, survives and throws Two-Face's bomb into the river. Assuming responsibility for Dick, Bruce allows him to stay at Wayne Manor. Dick declares his intention to kill Two-Face and avenge his family's murder, and when he discovers Bruce's secret identity as Batman, he insists on becoming his partner. Bruce, however, turns Dick down. Despite his master's wishes, Bruce's loyal butler Alfred provides guidance and counsel to Dick relating to his desire to follow Bruce's path.\n\nNygma, meanwhile, becomes the Riddler, allying with Two-Face and promising to discover Batman's identity-he sends Bruce two additional riddles. Having been mass produced and become popular, Nygma's device, the Box, has a unique side-effect allowing him to access its users' brainwaves and enabling him to discover every secret they possess, enhancing his own intelligence and knowledge in the process. Unveiling an advanced device at a business party, Nygma is able to discover Bruce's secret identity. Two-Face attacks the party and nearly buries Batman alive, but Dick saves his life. Continuing to turn down Dick's offer, Bruce gives up his post as the Dark Knight to discourage Dick, and pursues a relationship with Chase, whom he plans to tell his secret to.\n\nDisheartened by Bruce's plans, Dick takes his leave. However, Two-Face and the Riddler later infiltrate Wayne Manor on Halloween just after Bruce has revealed his identity to Chase. The Riddler enters the Batcave and destroys most of the equipment, and he and Two-Face kidnap Chase after Bruce is grazed on the head by a gunshot from Two-Face, though the Riddler stops Two-Face from killing him. They also leave Bruce a final riddle and detain Chase in the Riddler's lair.\n\nAfter solving the last riddle and using all the answers to determine who Riddler is, Bruce dons his only surviving Batsuit and prepares to confront his enemies. When Dick returns in a costume made by Alfred, telling Batman his stage name is \"Robin\", Batman finally accepts him as his partner. Batman and Robin locate the Riddler's lair, where the two are separated upon reaching the island. Robin engages Two-Face in a duel, nearly knocking the villain to his death. Robin shows mercy and aids Two-Face, but is taken hostage. Batman is able to successfully infiltrate the tower, whereupon the Riddle reveals Robin and Chase are both held hostage, bound and gagged in giant jars above a pit of water and metal spikes.\n\nThe Riddler tells Batman he may only save one hostage, but realizing that they are likely all doomed regardless of who he chooses, he stalls the Riddler with a riddle of his own, using the distraction to destroy the brain wave-collecting device, reversing its effect on the Riddler and sending him into a mental breakdown in the process. Batman is able to rescue Robin and Chase from falling to their deaths, only to find Two-Face holding them at gunpoint. After tricking Two-Face to use his coin, Batman tosses a handful of silver dollars as he flips it in mid-air. Two-Face is confused and falls to his death. The Riddler is sent to Arkham Asylum, and Chase is asked to consult on his case. Riddler offers to reveal the identity of Batman to her-only to claim that he is Batman, showing he has truly become insane. Chase tells Bruce his secret is safe, and they kiss before Chase departs."

    "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice": "Eighteen months after the destructive battle in Metropolis (Man of Steel (2013)), Superman has become a controversial figure. Billionaire Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck), who has covertly operated in Gotham City as vigilante Batman for nearly two decades, blames Superman for the mass casualties that resulted from his fight with General Zod (Michael Shannon). Among the casualties were many people working in Wayne Enterprises headquarters when the tower collapsed. Superman, in his public identity as Daily Planet journalist Clark Kent (Henry Cavill), sees Batman as dangerous and seeks to expose him. LexCorp's mogul Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) also sees Superman as a threat and convinces Senator June Finch (Holly Hunter) to help him recover kryptonite from Zod's failed terraforming attempt in the Indian Ocean. Finch later stonewalls Luthor's efforts to use Zod's DNA and the Kryptonian scout ship recovered from the battle to create a biological weapon. Wayne successfully infiltrates a fundraiser promoted by Luthor to retrieve data from LexCorp's mainframe, but his flash drive is stolen by mysterious antique dealer Diana Prince (Gal Gadot), who learns that Luthor has files on several \"metahumans;\" beings with superhuman abilities; herself, as well as a man with superhuman speed (Flash (Ezra Miller)), a cybernetic body (Cyborg (Ray Fisher)), and a man that lives underwater (Aquaman (Jason Momoa)). Wayne later receives the drive back from her after she copies it. While decrypting the drive, he has a vision of a dystopian future where he sees a gigantic omega symbol etched into a desert landscape. Armed with a pistol, he leads a force of rebels against Superman. Batman is betrayed by his own men, captured, and held prisoner by Superman's army. Superman approaches him, rips off his cowl, and tells him he took everything from him. Superman then rips out Batman's heart. Wayne is snapped out of the vision by a mysterious time traveler, who warns him that Lois Lane (Amy Adams) has a crucial role to an impending threat and that he must find the others. Before he vanishes, the time traveler yells that he's \"too soon\" with his message. He later learns not only of Luthor's experiments with kryptonite but also his ongoing investigation about metahumans including Prince herself, who is an immortal warrior. Batman attempts to retrieve Luthor's kryptonite in the Batmobile but is intercepted by Superman, who orders him to cease his activities. Later, Finch summons Superman to a Congressional hearing at the U.S. Capitol to debate the validity of his actions. Using a man (Wallace Keefe Scoot McNairy) who was paralyzed by Superman's battle with Zod in Metropolis, Luthor masterminds a bombing that kills dozens of people by hiding the bomb in the man's wheelchair. Everyone in the chamber is killed, including Finch. Despite being seen carrying the injured out of the blast zone, the public blames the bombing on Superman, who goes into self-imposed exile. Batman retrieves the kryptonite and prepares to launch a strike against Superman; building a powerful exoskeleton and kryptonite-powered arsenal. With Batman now having the kryptonite, Luthor activates the Genesis Chamber aboard the scout ship and splices his own DNA and Zod's. Luthor endangers Lois to lure Superman to LexCorp Tower, where he reveals that he has been aware of Superman's secrets for some time. Luthor blackmails Superman into confronting Batman by holding his adoptive mother, Martha Kent (Diane Lane), hostage at an undisclosed location, anticipating that Batman would kill Superman with his kryptonite. Superman tries to reason with Batman, revealing that he knows his secrets, but leads to a fight in which Batman nearly kills Superman with a spear he'd fashioned from the kryptonite. Superman pleads for Batman to \"save Martha,\" which was also the latter's late mother's name, prompting him to come to his senses and realize Superman is not a threat. Upon learning of Luthor's plan, Batman leaves to rescue Martha while Superman confronts Luthor, who unleashes a monstrous artificially-bred creature (Doomsday) made with Kryptonian technology on the crashed ship. Superman and Batman join forces to fight him and are aided by an arriving Prince in her Amazonian attire, but are outmatched due to the creature's ability to absorb and redirect energy, becoming indestructible in the process. Realizing that their shared Kryptonian DNA results in shared vulnerabilities, Superman retrieves the kryptonite spear and impales the creature with it, while the creature stabs Superman with his bony spike, seemingly killing him. Luthor is arrested after Lane exposes his numerous crimes; when he is visited by Batman in prison, he gloats that Superman's death has made the world vulnerable to powerful threats, of which he was taught about while manipulating the Kryptonian ship's technology. Batman threatens Luthor and promises that he will always be watching him. A memorial is held for Superman in Metropolis, and as Clark is also declared dead. Wayne, Lane, Martha, and Prince attend a private funeral for Clark in Smallville. Martha passes an envelope to Lane, which contains an engagement ring from Clark. After the funeral, Wayne reveals to Prince that he plans to form a team (the Justice League) from Luthor's file subjects to protect the world in Superman's absence. Later, a faint heartbeat begins echoing from Clark's grave and the dirt around it begins to levitate."

    "Batman vs. Robin": "The film begins on a snowy winter night with the batmobile racing out of Gotham City. The driver's eyes narrow with determination as he puts the controls on full throttle. The batmobile drives up to an abandoned \"Schott's Toy Factory\" in the middle of nowhere. The driver steps out and it is revealed to be Damian Wayne, Batman/Bruce Wayne's son, the new Robin. Robin is ordered by Batman via telecommunication not to continue his journey to the factory fhat once belonged to Anton Schott, psychopath and kidnapper who mutilates children in a bizarre belief that making them like toys will make them indestructible. Against Batman's orders, Robin investigates the factory and finds many children locked in cages. He is then attacked by Anton Schott now wearing broken doll's face as a mask and calling himself, \"The Dollmaker.\" Dollmaker's deformed children attack Robin until Batman arrives and puts all of them out with sleeping gas before releasing the ones in the cages. The Dollmaker flees but Robin hunts him down and beats him to the ground, repulsed by Dollmaker's crimes against humanity. He sets aside his ideals to kill Dollmaker by reminding himself aloud, \"Justice, not Vengeance.\" Just then, Dollmaker rises to attack him but is killed when a warrior wearing owl-like armor kills Dollmaker by ripping his heart out from behind. Holding the still beating heart, the warrior says, \"Don't doubt your instincts\" before leaping back into the surrounding forest and vanishing. Batman arrives right after and sees the dead Dollmaker. He immediately accuses Robin of killing him to which Robin says he resisted the urge. Batman calms down and asks who actually perpetrated the act, to which Robin refuses to answer and leaves in a huff. Upon investigating the Dollmaker's corpse, Batman finds an owl feather planted on him.\n\nAfter a brief opening title sequence, we are shown to Wayne Manor where Bruce is having a romantic dinner with his new girlfriend, the sultry rich woman, Samantha Vanover. He shows Samantha his digital map of Gotham for which he plans to enlarge and make Gotham a bigger, better city. Bruce and Samantha are about to kiss when they are interrupted by Damian who introduces himself to Samantha as Wayne's ward. After Samantha leaves, Bruce tries to bond with his son Damian, who is indignant at Bruce for 'keeping him a secret' by refusing to let him leave Wayne premises. Bruce and Damian watch the David Lean directed movie, \"Great Expectations.\" However, when Bruce is not looking, Damian attempts to escape Wayne Manor; the security system surrounding the manor prevents him from leaving, electrocuting him when he tries to climb over the boundary gate.\n\nBruce arrives and confronts him about this to which Damian is immediately angry that he is being kept under surveillance. Later in the Batcave, Damian asks Bruce if he would have killed Dollmaker if Damian were one of Dollmaker's victims. Bruce replies by saying, \"We need to be better than our baser instincts.\" Damian tries to connect with Bruce over their crime-fighting escapades, but Bruce refuses to let him in. He leaves to investigate the owl feather while Dick Grayson/Nightwing arrives to \"babysit\" Damian. The two battle and Damian is the victor, stating defiantly that he is Batman's son.\n\nBatman investigates the \"Hall of Owls\" exhibit in the Gotham Natural History Museum. He sees the owl feather was taken from a stuffed snow owl and has a flashback of how his father would tell him the nursery rhyme of the Court of Owls, which frightens the young Bruce. Bruce's father, Thomas Wayne promises to never let anything hurt Bruce in order to calm him down, only to be killed by Joe Chill soon after. The disillusioned and traumatized young Bruce grew paranoid shortly after seeing a great horned owl eating a bat on the night of his parents murder and had then believed the Court of Owls to be behind this. He then killed an owl living in his attic as a means to begin his hunt for the Court. However, despite all of his investigations into the richest and most powerful men in Gotham, he found nothing and told Alfred of his endeavors. He then sank into tears, upon realizing that there was seemingly no meaning to his parents death, to which Alfred tries to console him by telling him that bad things just simply happened. Bruce nevermore believed in a Court of Owls after that.\n\nAfter this flashback, Batman is attacked by three warriors in owl themed armor. He unmasks one of them to discover that it is a hideous un-dead abomination. His manages to destroy the obvious un-dead but is stabbed numerous times by the two others and smashed against a dinosaur skeleton as he tries to escape. The two warriors attempt to kill him but melt away into hideous wrecks. Batman sets out a tracking beacon for Alfred to notice and then falls unconscious. Meanwhile, Damien escapes from Dick's supervision and rushes out into the night where he beats down two street thugs attempting to rape an elderly woman. He terrorizes and beats them down but is uncertain as to go further.\n\nThe armored warrior from before arrives and encourages him to kill them but the police sirens are overhead. Robin instead leaves the crooks for the cops and follows after the warrior, who introduces himself as \"Talon.\" Robin follows Talon to Talon's home and Talon encourages Robin to fight crime with no rules, and instead instinct, to which Robin agrees with, though having his doubts. Talon gives Robin a knife as a gift, and a beacon to press if Robin decides to join Talon. Robin returns home to find Bruce waiting for him. As Dick nurses his wounds, Bruce and Damian argue until Bruce snatches Talon's knife from Damian and threatens to send him to a boarding school in Switzerland should he escape again. Damian escapes Wayne Manor when he overhears Bruce's dissatisfaction with him. Bruce sees that Alfred has turned off the security to allow Damian to escape out of pity for Damian. Alfred apologizes to Bruce and asks Bruce to have faith in Damian. \"Since when have I been a man of faith?\" Bruce replies angrily. Damian escapes to Gotham. Now Robin, he presses the beacon sent to him by Talon to which Talon hears.\n\nOn his way to dine with Samantha, Bruce's car is totaled by several cars driven by people wearing owl masks. He is drugged and brought to a large courtroom where he is addressed by the secret society of the Court of Owls, led by the hooded Grand Master, who tells Bruce that the court is interested in Bruce's plans for Gotham, and would like to oversee the process. Bruce plays along and pretends to be interested in the proposition, planting a tracking device on an owl mask he is offered. He is drugged again, and awakens with him and his smashed car in the driveway of Wayne Manor.\n\nThe Grand Master and Talon discuss their plans to take over Gotham with Bruce Wayne's involvement. It is also discussed of their plans to use Robin to kill Batman, as well as of their un-dead warriors also called \"Talons\" some of which are over 100 years. Talon himself is not keen of these creatures, as the Court plans to have him killed and regenerated as the general of the talons. Feeling like he is being strong-armed into giving into becoming and un-dead being, Talon plays along for now, but has his doubts of his loyalties.\n\nThe next night, Talon and Robin bring down a mob boss. Talon tries to convince Robin to kill the mob boss, but Robin refuses saying they have enough evidence to put him away for life. Later, Talon confronts Robin about not giving into his instincts and still being loyal to Batman. Talon then tells Robin of when he himself was a little boy. He and his father were Jewell thieves. Though he had always tried to please his father, he never was able. One night when they were stopped in their robbery, his father took his drunken anger out on him, beating him senseless. Young Talon then betrayed his father by arranging for the police to break in and kill him. The young Talon then was taken in by the Court of Owls.\n\nUpon finishing his story, the two are confronted by Batman. Talon encourages Robin to choose his side before running off. Batman tries to give chase but is attacked by Robin. The two battle savagely upon the roof and Batman tries to disable Robin while Robin is trying with all of his strength to kill Batman. The two fall and smash through a roof, destroying the head of a father figure statue as they do. Batman cushions Robin's fall and is greatly injured. Robin comes out on top and threatens to impale him with a wooden spike but decides against it. Batman encourages him to go home with him but Robin refuses, running back to Talon's home.\n\nTalon and Samantha are shown lying in bed. It is revealed that she is the Grand Master and plans to use Robin to kill Batman and make him into an un-dead talon general to take Talon's place. However, despite Samantha's reassurances, Talon has his doubts of her loyalty. Batman searches through the sewers and finds the hidden passageway to the Court of Owls' hideout. However, upon meeting them, it is revealed that he had been gassed with a hallucinogen. He falls through the floor and is lost within a maze after being clawed by an owl. He then finds his way back to crime alley where his parents were killed. He watches his parents be killed by a person wearing a Batman mask. The masked man then takes off his mask, thus revealing himself to be Damian Wayne as an adult. Young Bruce reprimands Batman, telling him that he has done nothing good, but has become a monster while making the worst abomination of all, Damian Wayne. Damian shoots Batman numerous times. The injured and dying Batman then musters up his strength and embraces Damian, begging for forgiveness. The enraged Damian calms down and seemingly forgives his father.\n\nBruce awakens back in Wayne Manor, having been rescued by Dick. Talon presents Robin to the Court of Owls who demand his loyalty and command him to take off his mask. Robin reluctantly agrees and unmasks, revealing himself to be Damian Wayne. The Grand Master, Samantha, recognizes Damian as Bruce Wayne's ward and deduces Bruce Wayne as Batman. Samantha orders Talon to kill Damian, but Talon realizes that if he does so, he will be made into an un-dead Talon nonetheless. He snaps and goes on a brutal killing spree, slaughtering every member of the Court of Owls, before hunting down Samantha and unmasking himself before unmasking her. He explains to her that he has much in common with Robin and kisses her, before ripping her heart out of her body saying, \"Be honest, you would have done the same to me.\"\n\nTalon beats Robin unconscious and locks him in an embalming tank before awakening the un-dead army. Talon and his army then rush to Wayne Manor and attack, somehow getting past the security. Batman and Nightwing fight the un-dead army from door to door, and room to room, as Alfred activates a panic room protocol. Batman and Nightwing battle talons in the library until Nightwing is stabbed many times by them, to which Batman destroys many of the talons and sends Nightwing to the batcave. He is then attacked by Talon. Batman knocks him to the ground and escapes to the batcave. Meanwhile, Robin escapes the embalming tank and rushes to Wayne Manor.\n\nTalon and Nightwing duel until Talon pins him to the wall and goes after Batman. Batman enters into a powerful exoskeleton machine called the Owl-smasher, and destroys many talons. The rest of the un-dead talon army is destroyed just before Talon enters the batmobile and peppers the Owl-smasher with heavy gunfire before ramming into it. With both machines fatally disabled, Talon goes in for the kill, but Batman attacks him saying, \"You and the court tried to take over my city, and destroy my home. But worst of all you messed with my kid. So this is going to hurt, and I am going to enjoy it.\" The two fight and Batman seemingly gains the upper hand, but Talon manages to wound Batman with a knife to the stomach. Batman goes down and Talon prepares to kill him but Robin intervenes. Talon, still sore from his battle with Batman, is beaten by Robin who has retrieved the knife Talon had given him earlier.\n\nRobin holds Talon at the edge of his knife proclaiming, \"You can never replace Batman. He is my father.\" Talon, realizing he is beaten but seeing an opportunity to still win, seizes the blade pointed at him and reminds Robin, \"Don't doubt your instincts\" one last time before stabbing himself through the throat. As Talon falls dead, Robin is traumatized when Batman tries to embrace him. Robin confesses to Batman that his is torn between Batman's influence and the influence of those of Talon's. Robin and Batman embrace and Robin leaves Wayne Manor to discover who he truly is.\n\nThe final scene shows the next morning with Bruce, Dick, and Alfred recovering from the wounds they received in last night's battles and cleaning the library. Bruce explains that Damien needs this time to discover who he is in the world and expresses faith that Damien will return. \"And if you are wrong, sir?' Alfred asks. Bruce smiles proudly and says, \"Sometimes Alfred, all it takes is a little faith.\" Damien is then shown in the Himalayas, journeying to a Buddhist monastery where Bruce Wayne journeyed to in his youth to discover who he was in these times of trouble."

    "Batman: Bad Blood": "Batwoman intercepts a group of criminals in Gotham City that includes Electrocutioner, Blockbuster, Firefly, Killer Moth, and others. When a fight ensues, Batman soon arrives. They are confronted by the apparent leader of the criminals, a man called the Heretic, who reminds Batman of his vision of Damian Wayne as Batman. Heretic detonates explosives planted within the facility. Batman flings Batwoman to safety and apparently perishes in the explosion.\n\nWeeks pass. Both Batman and Bruce Wayne's disappearances have not gone unnoticed - Alfred Pennyworth takes up the guise of Wayne in electronic communications using gadgets in the Batcave to maintain appearances, while sending out a distress signal to Dick Grayson. Meanwhile, Damian Wayne watches a news report of Batman's disappearance and sets out to return to Gotham. Katherine Kane meets with her father Colonel Jacob Kane revealing she feels responsible for Batman's apparent death and asks his help to track down Heretic. It is revealed that she was traumatized when she, her sister Elizabeth and her mother Gabrielle were abducted and held for ransom, although she was the only one not killed by her captors before her father rescued her. After her time in the military, she became a drunkard who was saved by Batman, the appearance of whom motivated her to never need to be saved again, resulting in her becoming Batwoman.\n\nAt the same time, Batman, wearing a different Bat emblem, apparently resurfaces and is quickly noticed by Robin and Katherine Kane. Both of them intercept Batman and quickly deduce that it is Grayson wearing an old version of the Batsuit. They begin their own investigations into the Heretic, unconvinced that Bruce is truly dead. Soon the Heretic and his henchmen attack Wayne Enterprises, forcing Lucius Fox to open the way into the vault by threatening his son Luke Fox, a soldier recently returned from Afghanistan. Though Grayson and Damian quickly arrive, they are unable to prevent the Heretic from escaping with Wayne technology, and Lucius Fox is non-fatally stabbed. Before they leave, Heretic kills Electrocutioner when he is about to kill Robin.\n\nHeretic returns to his headquarters where it is revealed that he is working for Talia al Ghul. They have Bruce Wayne captured and Mad Hatter is slowly brainwashing him with a machine projecting laser like beams into his eyes and brain causing him to experience nightmarish visions of his parents and friends as well as several bats attacking him. Mad Hatter claims Bruce's memories and experience, as well as his mental and emotional trauma, is causing the mind-controlling process to take longer on him than normal. The Heretic, apparently obsessed with Damian Wayne, then breaks into the Batcave and kidnaps Damian. Heretic explains that he is a clone of Damian, created by a genetics program created by Ra's al Ghul and the League of Assassins, using Damian's DNA to genetically engineer a perfect soldier with accelerated growth and development, but he was the only subject of the program to survive with Mad Hatter giving him an actual mind and consciousness. Due to his feeling of not being a real person, he wishes to have Damian's memories and personality implanted within his own brain with the mind programming machine being used on Bruce, but Talia arrives and then shoots Heretic dead for his disobeying her orders to leave Damian out of the conflict. Grayson and Batwoman then arrive, having located Damian through a tracker in his costume. They are quickly joined by Luke Fox, clad in an advanced combat exosuit and styling himself as Batwing. The three rescue Bruce and Damian, but Talia and her henchmen escape.\n\nWeeks pass and Bruce seems to have recovered from the ordeal, though he remains adamant that Katherine and Luke not be involved, insisting that their heroics remain within the \"family\". Meanwhile, Katherine is suddenly attacked by her father. After disabling him, she discovers he had been brainwashed. She brings this to the attention of Grayson, Damian, and Luke. Dick immediately concludes that Bruce is still under the effects of Mad Hatter's mind control, though Damian is unconvinced. Luke reveals that the League of Assassins are planning to brainwash a number of world leaders at a tech summit held by Bruce Wayne with the use of advanced earpieces being distributed to the attendees.\n\nAs the brainwashing is taking place, Nightwing, Robin, Batwoman, Alfred, and Batwing arrive and fight Talia and her henchmen. During the fight, Mad Hatter is killed, thus stopping the mind control from undergoing to completion. Bruce, under the effects of the brainwashing, is made to fight Nightwing and defeats him. Talia then orders him to shoot Grayson and Damian dead, but Bruce, with the help of Grayson's pleas, resists the effects of the mind control and disobeys her. Incensed, Talia escapes into her auto pilot vessel only to be met by Onyx, a member of Heretic's team who attempts to murder her in revenge for the ruthless death of Heretic, causing the vessel to crash, resulting in both her and the latter's death. The \"Bat family\" then returns to the Batcave to plan their next move. Nightwing explains that none of the Mad Hatter's programming can function without his being around to activate it.\n\nThe Bat skylight shines in Gotham City where Batwoman, Nightwing, and Batwing assemble to meet Batman and Robin on top of the police station where they see Penguin escaping cops by car. Batwoman and Batwing fly down, as Batman, Robin and Nightwing fire their grappling guns. On a nearby building, Batgirl observes the group launch their chase and fires her own grappling gun to join the pursuit."

    "Batman: Gotham by Gaslight": "In Victorian-era Gotham City, Bruce Wayne is operating as the bat-garbed vigilante, the Batman, who is feared by the guilty and the innocent alike.\n\nOne night, Batman saves a wealthy couple from being robbed by three orphans (Dickie, Jason and Timmy) and defeats their handler, Big Bill Dust. At the same time, Ivy, an orphan turned exotic dancer and prostitute, becomes the latest victim of Jack the Ripper. The murders keep happening night after night.\n\nCitizens of Gotham believe the Batman and Jack to be the same man. Stage actress Selina Kyle, a protector of the women from \"Skinner's End\", verbally attacks Gotham policemen James Gordon and Chief Bullock for their inaction in stopping Jack. Later that night, Selina acts as bait for Jack. It works, but Jack gets the upper hand during their fight until the arrival of Batman. After escaping, Batman asks Gordon to help him bring Jack the Ripper down.\n\nAt the Monarch Theatre with his friend Harvey Dent, Bruce meets Selina and the two bond at the Dionysus Club. Bruce realizes that not only were the two of them taken in by Sister Leslie but that some of the murdered girls were orphans formerly under Leslie's care. Bruce rushes out to save Leslie from Jack the Ripper but is too late as Jack has already murdered her. At the crime scene, Bruce finds a bloody Dionysus Club pin, meaning Jack has to be one of Gotham's wealthy. At Sister Leslie's funeral, Bruce is met by Hugo Strange, claiming he knows the killer and wants to meet with Batman. Bruce also is met by Marlene, a drunken old woman who claims she saw him sneaking around when Sister Leslie was killed. Alfred stops the three orphans from pick-pocketing him and decides to help them.\n\nAt Arkham Asylum, Hugo is attacked by Jack the Ripper and is ripped apart by his own crazed patients. Batman chases Jack on top of an airship in a fight that leaves Batman wounded as the airship explodes and Jack the Ripper escapes. Batman is chased by police, only to be saved by Selina when he is nearly cornered. After seeing Batman is Bruce Wayne, she takes him to her home where they spend the night. After the death of Marlene is discovered, Bruce is arrested as Dent accuses him of being Jack the Ripper due to his jealousy for Selina's love.\n\nSent to Blackgate Penitentiary, Bruce is met by Selina, urging him to reveal he is Batman to clear his name and help save the girls from Jack. When he refuses, she decides to tell Gordon herself, revealing she has one of his batarangs. Bribing a guard to deliver a coded message to his manor, Bruce escapes after staging a prison fight. Bruce meets with the orphans, who deliver him his suit and a steampunk motorcycle.\n\nSelina meets with Gordon at the Gotham City World's Fair and discovers to her horror that Gordon is Jack the Ripper. Batman discovers this too when he is at Gordon's home and discovers his secret room exposing his gruesome hobbies and past as a butcher. Batman also sees Gordon's wife, Barbara-Eileen Gordon, with scars on the left side of her face that has made her into a lunatic praising her husband for treating her sins as a woman. Selina is injected with a drug but manages to use her blood and the Fair's searchlight to create a makeshift Bat-Signal. Batman arrives and fights Gordon into a Ferris wheel, where Gordon reveals his holy work is to rid Gotham from what he sees as filth, from the poor to the criminals but also immigrants, the illiterate, and anarchists. The Ferris Wheel lights on fire and begins to collapse. Selina escapes, while Batman watches as Gordon willingly burns himself alive. Luckily, Batman and Selina are saved by Alfred and the orphans. As they escape, they watch as the World's Fair burns down, hoping it will be replaced with something better."

    "Batman: Mask of the Phantasm": "A meeting between crime lord Chuckie Sol (Dick Miller) and his cronies starts one night in Gotham City. Sol is instructing his men about the procedure for laundering some new counterfeit bills through their casino when the meeting is interrupted by the Batman. Batman takes out Sol's' cronies but Chuckie manages to get to the parking garage.\n\nSol is greeted by a mysterious figure (who he first mistakes for Batman) stating the phrase \"Your Angel of Death awaits.\" This mysterious Phantasm (voiced by Stacey Keach) is nearly run down by Sol's car, but tricks Sol into driving out a nearby window to his death. Batman arrives on the scene and observes Sol; the people below see Batman and assume he is responsible for what has happened.\n\nNext morning, Councilman Arthur Reeves (Hart Bochner) is giving a press conference about Batman's apparent actions. He wants to hunt down Batman and arrest the vigilante. Commissioner James Gordon (Bob Hastings) is against it, since he doesn't believe Batman would commit first-degree murder. Detective Harvey Bullock (Robert Costanzo), on the other hand, is in favor of stopping Batman.\n\nAlfred (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.) and Bruce (Kevin Conroy) are watching the presentation in the Batcave. Alfred dismisses Reeves' claims. Batman, in turn, is analyzing a chemical found on the glass from Chuckie Sol's car.\n\nCouncilman Reeves is in his office, talking to a woman (Dana Delany) on the phone. She's flying into town after being gone for 10 years to settle some old finances.\n\nDuring a party at Wayne Manor, Bruce confronts Arthur about his Batman stance. Arthur counters with some remarks about Bruce's love life, and mentions the name of one woman from Bruce's past- Andrea Beaumont.\n\nBruce confronts the portrait of his parents, flashing back to his memory of meeting Andrea in the graveyard while they both visited dead relatives (Andrea with her mother, Bruce with his parents). They both talk about how they miss their families. Bruce slyly mentions that he made a vow to his parents upon their death, and that \"so far\" he has kept it.\n\nThe night after meeting Andrea, Bruce goes out crime-fighting for the first time in his life. Decked out in a simple mask and street clothes, he confronts a group of thieves conducting a heist at a warehouse. Bruce is able to fend them off, but the thieves do not treat him as a serious threat.\n\nNext morning, after bandaging his wounds, Bruce exercises while talking to Alfred. Bruce thinks that he failed to keep control of the situation because the criminals weren't afraid of him. Andrea arrives to speak with Bruce, and before long the two have begun a romantic relationship. The flashback ends and Bruce goes back out to the party.\n\nAnother Gotham crime lord, Buzz Bronski (John P. Ryan) visits the grave of Chuckie Sol to pay his respects to the deceased mobster. He hears the mysterious voice repeating \"Your Angel of Death Awaits\"- the Phantasm has come for Bronski. Bronski falls into a grave and the Phantasm kills Bronski by pushing a huge stone angel onto him. Buzz's bodyguards see a caped figure walking away from the scene and assume it is the Batman.\n\nElderly crime boss Salvatore Valestra (Abe Vigoda) reads the obituary of Buzz Bronski and the news story about Batman being thought responsible for the crimes. He is shocked at the news, resulting in a panic attack.\n\nArthur is now more fanatical than ever in his crusade against Batman. Commissioner Gordon vehemently refuses to participate, so Bullock eagerly steps up.\n\nAfter Batman collects evidence at the scene of Buzz Bronski's murder, he takes a brief moment to reflect at the graveside of his parents. Andrea Beaumont is also in the graveyard; she spots a figure at the Wayne graves and automatically assumes that it is Bruce.\n\nAndrea has dinner with Councilman Reeves, her mind distracted by what she saw that night. Batman observes her on stakeout. This triggers another flashback- Bruce takes Andrea to the Gotham World's Fair, observing several prototype inventions- including a distinctive looking car. Andrea invites Bruce to come and meet her father, and he agrees. Bruce voices his discomfort to Alfred; his relationship with Andrea wasn't something he's planned on.\n\nBruce & Andrea greet Carl Beaumont, who is just finishing business with Arthur Reeves (Reeves works for Beaumont's legal department at this time). The meeting is interrupted by Valestra, who wants to speak with Carl. Both Bruce & Andrea are suspicious of Valestra.\n\nBruce spots a street merchant being robbed by a motorcycle gang. He goes after them, but his concern for Andrea distracts him and they get away.\n\nThat night, Bruce tries to design a costume for himself but cannot continue. Bruce knows that he can't complete the vow he made to his parents with someone like Andrea in his life. Bruce goes to his parents' grave site to try and justify his feelings. Andrea meets him and they go home together.\n\nWhen a police helicopter approaches the nearby roof, Batman is brought out of his memory trip and returns home.\n\nThe next day, Councilman Reeves is approached by Valestra. Reeves confirms that Batman is apparently attacking \"their people.\" Valestra pleads with Reeves for protection but the crooked Councilman refuses to help.\n\nUsing the Bat-Computer, Batman confirms that the two dead men- Sol & Bronski- were partners in phony dummy corporations set up at least 10 years ago. There was a third man involved- Sal Valestra. Batman goes off to confront Valestra. Alfred asks if Batman will see Andrea when he is done. Batman tells Alfred that he knows less about him than he thinks and drives off in the Batmobile.\n\nIn Valestra's office, Batman finds a photo of Carl Beaumont with Valestra and the two dead men. This triggers yet another flashback- Bruce proposes to Andrea and she happily accepts. They are interrupted by a huge swarm of bats coming from a cave below the house. Andrea returns to her father's house to see that some people have arrived to speak with Carl. She goes inside to tell her father the good news.\n\nBruce explores the cave and marvels at its huge size. When he returns, Alfred solemnly hands him a package. Andrea has returned Bruce's ring, stating only that she is leaving town and encouraging Bruce to forget her. Bruce, heartbroken, throws himself back into \"The Plan.\" That very night, he dons the Batsuit for the first time. Alfred, seeing the transformation from Bruce to Batman, can only watch and remark \"My God!\"\n\nA now desperate Valestra goes to the now abandoned World's Fair, which is a hideout for the Joker (Mark Hamill), who greets him like an old friend. Valestra tells him that he thinks Batman is killing off members of \"the old gang.\" Joker notes that this is uncharacteristic behavior for Batman, and insists he is not a hired gun for the mob. Valestra reminds him that if the vigilante is specifically targeting his old associates, then it's only a matter of time before they go after the Joker. Valestra also reminds Joker that he is even more guilty than Valestra himself is. The Joker then assures Sal that he will not be harmed.\n\nAndrea ends her date with Arthur, and finds Batman in her room. He asks about the men photographed with her father, but she tells him nothing. Denying any connection, Andrea states that Batman is the only one there who is still controlled by his parents.\n\nThe Phantasm comes to Valestra's apartment, only to find that Sal has already been given a lethal dose of Joker toxin. Joker, watching from a hidden camera, is shocked to see that the killer isn't really Batman. The Phantasm narrowly escapes a bomb set by the Joker.\n\nBatman confronts the Phantasm on the rooftop. A police helicopter confronts Batman, and Phantasm uses the chance to escape. Batman hides out in a construction site, but is soon able to trick the police into attacking a phony target (losing his cape & cowl in the process). Andrea drives up as Batman/Bruce is fleeing and offers him a getaway vehicle. They elude the police.\n\nAlfred bandages Bruce's wounds while he talks to Andrea. She tells Bruce about what happened the night he proposed. A flashback reveals that Carl Beaumont is begging for his life in front of Valestra's men. Andrea walks in, and her life is jeopardized too. Valestra gives Carl 24 hours to return the money that was embezzled or Carl will die. Andrea opposes her father's actions and does not wish to run, but Carl insists that there is no hope for them in Gotham. They end up fleeing to Europe.\n\nIn the present, Andrea tells Bruce that her father was eventually able to pay off his debt, but Valestra's men considered it too little, too late. Bruce thinks that the man in the Phantasm costume is Carl- killing off the gangsters to finally be free of his debt, which still remains in effect during the present day. Bruce & Andrea are obviously still in love, but Bruce states that he still has to stop the Phantasm.\n\nBruce looks at the photo he took from Valestra again. He recognizes the features on one man, and-after an alteration with red ink- confirms that Valestra's former bodyguard is actually The Joker!\n\nCouncilman Reeves is furious that Batman escaped. The Joker confronts Reeves and talks about what's been happening, mentioning that someone other than Batman is responsible for the killings. Reeves refuses to believe Batman's innocence and the Joker suspects Reeves of trying to erase his ties to the Valestra mob, which he denies having. Andrea then calls Arthur, which confirms Joker's suspicions. Afterwards, Joker doses Reeves with his laughing toxin, and Arthur is hospitalized in a hysterical laughing fit.\n\nBatman confronts Reeves that night, confirming the details about Reeve's connection to the Beaumonts. Arthur kept in touch with Carl while he was abroad, helping to set up funds. But when Reeves asked Carl for help in financing an election, Carl refused. So, desperate for funds, Arthur sold Carl out to Valestra's mob. Batman leaves the hospital in disgust.\n\nBatman searches Andrea's apartment for more clues, finding a locket with a picture of Andrea & himself inside. The phone rings and Batman answers it- it's the Joker, sending another bomb into the apartment. Batman manages to escape and recognizes the design of the plane that flew in the bomb. He deduces that Joker is hiding out in the ruins of the Gotham World's Fair.\n\nIn a final flashback, Andrea returns to her father's new home after some grocery shopping, only to find Valestra's bodyguard emerging. Fearing the worst, she drops the grocery bags and runs. As Andrea screams in horror, the future Joker grabs an apple out of the discarded grocery bags, then casually walks away.\n\nPhantasm confronts Joker, and Joker applauds the Phantasm's scheme. Phantasm is revealed to be Andrea Beaumont, out for revenge against her father's murderers. Batman arrives and confronts Andrea, who states that vengeance is now all that she has left. Batman and Joker fight, eventually triggering a fire in the World's Fair props. Andrea grabs Joker, vowing that her crusade will end no matter what. She disappears in an explosion, but Batman manages to get away. However, there is no apparent trace of Andrea or the Joker.\n\nIn the Batcave, Bruce regrets not being able to save Andrea. Alfred states that it is quite possible Andrea didn't want to be saved. A glimmer in the cave attracts Bruce's attention- he finds the same locket from Andrea's apartment.\n\nOut on a cruise, Andrea gazes out at the sea, truly alone in the world. Batman, cleared of the accusations against him and although still crestfallen from losing Andrea again, resumes crimefighting."

    "Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1": "In a dystopian near-future version of Gotham City, 55-year-old Bruce Wayne has retired from being Batman following the death of his former sidekick, Jason Todd. Criminals now run amok and the city is constantly terrorized by a gang known as the Mutants. Bruce Wayne is now something of a recluse, despite his continuous philanthropic endeavors and friendship with Commissioner James Gordon (who now knows Bruce's former identity as Batman).\n\nThe escalating brutality of the Mutants prompts Bruce to take up the mantle of Batman again, but the public opinion over Batman and his methods is sharply divided. While the public generally approve of Batman's return, richer and more powerful people such as the unnamed Mayor of Gotham City and Dr. Bartholomew Wolper (head psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum) brand Batman as a fascist. Bruce's old friend Harvey Dent (formerly Two-Face) undergoes plastic surgery and his face is repaired but at the high cost of eradicating Dent's good side forever. Batman confronts Two-Face and stops him from holding the city ransom with a bomb.\n\nInspired by Batman's actions, 13-year-old girl Carrie Kelley buys herself a Robin costume and searches for Batman to aid him. She finds him at the city dump where the Mutant gang is gathering. Onboard a tank-like Batmobile, Batman defeats most of the gang (shooting them with rubber bullets) before confronting the Mutant Leader in hand to hand combat where he is overpowered, but Kelley distracts the Leader long enough for Batman to subdue him. She then rescues the injured Batman and tends to his wounds as the vehicle drives toward the Batcave. Once home, Batman takes Carrie on as the new Robin despite the objections of his butler Alfred Pennyworth. Batman instructs Carrie to disguise herself as a Mutant and spread the word of a meeting at Gotham Pipe while Batman arranges the Mutant Leader's escape from prison. The Mayor attempts to negotiate with the Mutant Leader in his cell, but the Mutant Leader brutally mauls him to death. Gordon then \"accidentally\" allows the Leader out of his cell and he makes his way through the ventilation system leading him to Gotham Pipe where he finds his entire army waiting. Batman appears and engages the Mutant Leader in battle again. Only this time, Batman manages to outsmart the Leader's moves and eventually subdues him, breaking several of his bones in front of his army. Accepting defeat, the Mutants disband into smaller gangs. One gang in particular operates under the name of \"The Sons of Batman\" where they work to purge Gotham of crime with questionable methods.\n\nBatman's return and victory over the Mutants becomes public news. Following the death of the Mayor, Deputy Mayor Stevenson has been sworn in as the new Mayor of Gotham City. Nearing retirement, Gordon meets with his successor Police Captain Ellen Yindel who also voices her doubts over Batman's methods. Meanwhile in Arkham Asylum, a catatonic patient sees a report about Batman on the news and gives off a disturbing grin."

    "Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2": "Feigning remorse for his past, Joker convinces Wolper to take him on a talk show to tell his story; he makes plans for his escape with an old henchman, who supplies him with mind-controlling lipstick. Meanwhile, Superman, who works as a government operative in exchange for being allowed to covertly help people, is asked by the President to end Batman's vigilante activities. Framing these events is a growing hostility between the USA and the Soviet Union over possession of the island of Corto Maltese. As Batman's continued presence humiliates the national authorities, Yindel becomes commissioner and orders Batman's arrest, and Superman warns Batman that the government will not tolerate him much longer.\n\nJoker makes his talk show appearance on David Endochrine's show as Batman fights with the GCPD on the studio roof; while they fight, Joker kills Wolper, gasses everyone in the studio to death and escapes. He finds Selina Kyle and uses one of her escorts and his lipstick to take control of a congressional representative, who calls for a nuclear strike on the Soviets before falling to his death. Batman's investigation leads him to Selina, whom he finds bound and dressed like Wonder Woman. Kelley notices cotton candy on the floor, and Batman deduces that Joker is at the fairgrounds. There Kelley accidentally kills Joker's henchman while Batman pursues the Joker, who indiscriminately guns down dozens of people. As Batman corners a wounded and partially blinded Joker, he admits to feeling responsible for every murder Joker has committed and intends to stop him permanently. In the ensuing fight, Joker stabs Batman repeatedly, and Batman breaks Joker's neck in front of witnesses.\n\nContent that he made Batman lose control and that he will be branded a murderer, the Joker finishes twisting his neck, killing himself. The GCPD arrive and Batman, bleeding profusely, fights his way to Kelley and escapes. After Superman deflects a Soviet nuclear missile, he is hit with the blast and badly injured; the detonation creates an electromagnetic pulse that wipes out all electrical equipment in the United States and causes a nuclear winter. As the city descends into chaos, Batman, Kelley and Gordon rally the Sons of Batman and the citizens of Gotham to restore order, and Yindel accepts that Batman has become too powerful to take down. While the rest of the powerless U.S. is overrun with crime, Gotham becomes the safest city in America, embarrassing the President's administration and prompting them to send Superman to finally stop Batman. Batman and Superman agree to meet in Crime Alley.\n\nWearing a powerful exoframe and supported by Kelley and former superhero Oliver Queen (Green Arrow), Batman fights Superman, using various tactics to make the fight even. When Superman gains the advantage, Queen hits him with an arrow made that releases Kryptonite dust in his face. Superman inhales the dust, which works its way through his system. His powers gone, Batman defeats Superman, and claims that he intentionally made the Kryptonite weak, to defeat Superman without killing him. Batman then apparently dies of a heart attack, while Wayne Manor self-destructs, and Alfred dies of a stroke. In the aftermath, the world learns that Bruce was Batman; all of his secrets are destroyed with the manor and his finances disappear. As Superman leaves Wayne's funeral, he gives Kelley a knowing wink after hearing a faint heartbeat coming from Bruce's coffin. In underground caves, Bruce is revealed to have faked his death and makes preparations to continue his mission more discreetly, allied with Kelley, Queen, and his followers."

    "Batman: The Killing Joke": "This animated film starts with Barbara Gordon/Batgirl (voice of Tara Strong) observing Bruce Wayne/Batman (voice of Kevin Conroy) meeting with Commissioner Jim Gordon (voice of Ray Wise). Gordon shone the bat-signal to call Batman due to a robbery in progress. Batman heads off to take care of it while Batgirl pursues the robbers herself.\n\nThe getaway van is driven by two punks, one among them being Paris Franz (voice of Maury Sterling), nephew of Gotham City's biggest crime lord Carlos Francesco (voice of John DiMaggio). Batman chases the crooks in the Batmobile while Batgirl leaps onto the van. She blows the backdoor open, letting some other criminals shoots at Batman. Paris shoots at Batgirl, causing her to fall off the van. She and Batman end up catching one criminal, but Batman is upset with Batgirl for getting in the way and almost harming herself.\n\nParis and his buddy meet with Francesco. He is pissed at his nephew for Batgirl's intervention, where four of Francesco's men were caught, as well as $100,000. Francesco orders Paris to get the money back, or he'll have him killed.\n\nParis and his goons go to rob a warehouse. Batgirl finds them, which Paris was counting on since he's developed an infatuation with her. He sprays her with knockout gas, but she has enough time to knee him in the groin before hiding out in the vault. Paris and the others get away. After she comes to and the police arrive, Batman meets Batgirl on a rooftop. He expresses his concern for her work on the case and orders her to stay off it. This angers Barbara, making her feel like Batman won't trust her.\n\nThe criminals are on their boat after a night with some prostitutes. Paris gets a call from Francesco, and when his buddy picks up the phone, he gets shot in the head. Outside the boat are four shooters on a motorboat. Paris and his other cohort make their getaway by rigging the boat to explode as the hitmen board it, killing them all.\n\nParis sends a video message to Batgirl so she can go looking for him. Batman is with her while she watches it. He knows it's a trap, so he tells her to stay off the case. She doesn't listen and follows the clues, leading her to find another phone with a message from Paris. She is led to an apartment where she discovers Francesco's dead body. Two of Francesco's men show up, forcing Batgirl to flee. Batman arrives and starts kicking ass.\n\nBatman and Batgirl stand on a rooftop arguing. She is finally pushed over the edge and she begins to attack Batman. He defends himself but is quickly subdued. In the heat of the moment, Batgirl kisses him. She then takes off her cowl and suit, revealing her breasts and they proceed to have passionate sex. This later fills Barbara with regret.\n\nThe next night, Batgirl calls Batman as he is driving to find Paris. The Batmobile gets hit with an RPG by the docks. Batman ejects himself to safety and is faced by a bunch of crooks. Batgirl shows up on her motorcycle. She finds Paris and beats his face to a bloody pulp, but stops before she kills him.\n\nParis is arrested, but Batgirl realizes what Batman was saying in regards to his concern for her. She meets him as Barbara and tells her she is giving up being Batgirl.\n\nA while later, Batman meets with Detective Harvey Bullock (voice of Robin Atkin Downes) at a crime scene where four men have been found dead, all of them with big smiles on their faces. Batman knows this is the work of The Joker (voice of Mark Hamill). He and Bullock go to Arkham Asylum to meet with him in his cell. The Joker appears to be obscured in darkness. Batman tells him that this will end with one of them killing the other. The man doesn't respond and continues stacking playing cards. Batman grabs his hand and sees the man has white powder on his hand. He pulls the man into the light and sees he is not Joker, but a decoy.\n\nThe real Joker is meeting with another man to buy out an abandoned amusement park for a sinister purpose.\n\nWe see a flashback of Joker before he became what he is now. He was a struggling comedian tending to his pregnant wife Jeannie (voice of Anna Vocino). The two had been in financial troubles for a while, and he was trying to find a way to support his growing family.\n\nBruce is in the batcave trying to figure out what Joker's motives are. Alfred (Brian George) tells him he can't save everyone.\n\nBarbara is with her father in his apartment. She hears a knock at the door, thinking it's a friend of hers. It's The Joker, holding a gun. He shoots Barbara in her abdomen and sends her crashing onto a coffee table in front of Gordon. Two of Joker's men come in and beat Gordon before taking him away.\n\nAnother flashback shows Pre-Joker meeting with two gangsters at a bar as he tries to come up with some money. The gangsters want him to help them break into the chemical plant where he once worked so that they can pull off a heist at the card company next to it. They show Pre-Joker the mask they want him to wear, which is that of The Red Hood. Two officers find Pre-Joker at the bar and inform him that Jeannie has died in an accident. The man expresses grief and says he has no more reason to go through with the crime. The gangsters give him their condolences but insist that it's too late for him to back out now.\n\nBatman finds Barbara at the hospital. The doctor tells him that she will never be able to walk again due to the through-and-through bullet injury to her spine. Bullock also implies to Batman that Joker may have raped her. Barbara wakes up and tells Batman that Joker is trying to prove a point, and that Gordon is \"top of the bill\".\n\nGordon is taken to Joker's amusement park where he is tortured by some of Joker's freak show henchmen. The freaks take Gordon onto a ride through a house of horrors as Joker puts on a performance with the other freaks. Gordon is forced to see pictures of Barbara nude and bloodied, with Joker's intention being to drive Gordon insane.\n\nThe last flashback shows Pre-Joker and the gangsters getting ready to pull off the heist as Pre-Joker wears Red Hood's mask and cape. They engage in a shootout with security as Batman arrives on the scene. The gangsters die while Pre-Joker is startled by Batman. He trips over his cape and falls into a vat of chemicals. He is swept out through a pipe into the river. Once he gets out, he sees his reflection in a puddle. His skin is bleached white, his lips are red, and his hair is green. His mind then warps into insanity, and he is now The Joker.\n\nBatman finds a clue that leads him to the amusement park. He finds Gordon, who remains sane. As Batman heads to pursue Joker, Gordon tells him to capture him \"by the books\" to show that their way works. Batman follows Joker into the funhouse as he fends off the freaks who try to kill Batman. Joker taunts Batman by saying the world isn't worth fighting for and how one bad day can turn anyone insane, as it was one bad day that led Batman into becoming what he is now. The two of them fight until Batman throws himself and Joker out the window. Joker tries to shoot him, but the gun only pops out a \"click bang bang\" sign. Batman tells Joker that he doesn't want either of them to kill each other, and he offers to help him. Joker seems surprised at first but declines, saying it's too late for him. He then starts to tell a joke about two men escaping from a loony bin. After the punchline, both Batman and Joker start laughing together until eventually only Batman's laughter is heard.\n\nDuring the end credits, Barbara is seen in a wheelchair. She goes into her room and onto the computer, where we see the Oracle logo, indicating that she has new work to begin."

    "Batman: The Long Halloween, Part One": "In Gotham City on Halloween, Carmine \"The Roman\" Falcone's nephew, Johnny Viti, is murdered by a mysterious figure who leaves a jack-o-lantern at the crime scene.\n\nGotham City Police Department Captain, James Gordon, summons District Attorney Harvey Dent and Gotham's vigilante Batman to investigate the murder. Batman follows Catwoman to Falcone's cash stockpile. Based on a coin flip, Dent decides to burn the money rather than move it legally. In retaliation, Falcone hires San Ho Hui Triad member, Mickey Chen, to bomb Dent's house. Both Dent and his wife Gilda survive, but Dent is hospitalized.\n\nBatman chases Chen down to the sewers, where Chen runs into Solomon Grundy. Batman convinces Grundy to spare Chen and takes Chen to the GCPD. Lacking evidence of his involvement in the bombing, Batman and Gordon are forced to release him. Gordon advises Batman to learn more about being a detective.\n\nOn Thanksgiving, Falcone reminds his son, Alberto, that he will never inherit the family business. Dent escapes from the hospital and meets Gordon, who gives him a gun for protection. After Chen and his associates are killed by Viti's murderer, Gordon and Batman question Calendar Man in Arkham Asylum on the identity of the murderer, who is now coined \"Holiday.\" Calendar Man names Falcone, Sal Maroni, and Dent all as suspects. He then says that Batman's war on crime is a \"joke,\" and Batman realizes the Joker has escaped from Arkham.\n\nNot wanting Holiday to replace him as Gotham's most notorious criminal, Joker confronts Dent in his home and threatens to kill Gilda if Dent is proven to be Holiday. Maroni advises Batman that if Joker is Holiday, he will inevitably target Falcone himself. On Christmas Eve, Joker harasses Falcone, warning him to divulge any new information about Holiday to him. Falcone's bodyguard, Milos Grappa, chases Joker out of the building but is killed by Holiday.\n\nIn the Batcave, Batman identifies Maroni, Falcone's sister, Carla Viti, Joker, Falcone, and an unnamed figure, implied to be Dent, as suspects.\n\nBruce Wayne attends a New Year's Eve yacht party celebrating Gotham's children's clinic, hosted by Falcone, who calls out Bruce during his speech as the son he never had. Bruce meets with Selina Kyle, who calls off their relationship due to their conflicting secret identities.\n\nJoker attempts to gas Times Square from a stolen plane, hoping that Holiday is among the crowds. After Batman foils Joker, he returns to the yacht and accuses Alberto of being Holiday, targeting his father's associates to gain power within the family. Alberto argues he only ever wanted to live his own life, rather than being controlled by his father. The latter had previously rejected Alberto's fianc\u00e9e from Oxford.\n\nAs the New Year hits, Alberto is shot by Holiday and falls into the bay, where he is cut to pieces by the propellers. Batman pursues Holiday, but Holiday escapes the yacht. As the yacht is evacuated, Gordon and Dent meet with Batman. He tells them to assign a protective detail to Falcone and vows to be a better detective.\n\nIn the post-credits scene, following Alberto's funeral, Falcone requests Bruce's help laundering his money, but Bruce refuses. Falcone then introduces his associate, who shakes Bruce's hand while vines emerge from her sleeve, and Bruce's eyes turn green."

    "Batman: The Long Halloween, Part Two": "Poison Ivy has been controlling Bruce Wayne for three months and has been forcing him to sign over assets to Carmine Falcone, while unintentionally preventing him from acting as Batman. Catwoman rescues Bruce (and Alfred) from Poison Ivy. In the meantime, the Holiday killings have continued through Valentine's Day, Saint Patrick's Day, and April Fools' Day.\n\nOn Mother's Day, Holiday kills the gunmaker that had been supplying his weapons. That night, Scarecrow escapes from Arkham Asylum and ends up in a fight with Batman, and escapes by injecting fear toxin into Batman's abdomen. In a fear-induced hallucination, Batman staggers around Gotham, ending up in Crime Alley, where Catwoman finds him and takes him home. Carmine's daughter, Sofia Falcone, meets with her father after arranging Scarecrow's escape and asks for a seat at his table, which he declines. Dent and Gordon visit Bruce Wayne to get his testimony regarding the night Alberto was killed, with Dent insinuating that there might be a connection between him and the murders, due to the Waynes funding the Falcone Crime Family in the past. Bruce recalls an incident from his childhood where he met Carmine after his father saved his life following a shooting from the Maronis, and claims that this incident might've lead to the death of his parents a year later, insisting that any loyalty between the Waynes died with them.\n\nOn Father's Day, Maroni meets with his father, Luigi, who is then murdered by Holiday. Following his last advice of making peace with his enemies, Maroni approaches Dent, agreeing to testify against Falcone in exchange for prosecutorial immunity. On the Fourth of July, Harvey and Gilda watch the evening fireworks display on a boardwalk alongside Gordon's family. At the same time, Batman is captured while trying to stop Scarecrow and the Mad Hatter from robbing a bank for the Falcones, but easily escapes his restraints and defeats the two villains. At Carmine's signal, a mob hitman attacks the Dents. Catwoman intervenes but is in turn knocked unconscious by the hitman, who also knocks out Harvey when he gives chase under the boardwalk. When Harvey awakens, he finds the hitman dead, shot by one of holiday's guns, and hears a voice telling him to run before the police arrive.\n\nBefore Maroni's trial, Batman sneaks into Dent's house, finding paraphernalia associated with the Holiday killer in the basement, along with an Oxford pennant, presenting this evidence to Gordon privately on the courthouse roof. During the trial, Dent is tormented by more messages from the voice, and Maroni, going back on his deal, claims that Carmine is an upstanding citizen. Convinced by the Falcones that Dent is Holiday, Maroni throws a vial of acid in Dent's face to get revenge for his father's death, although he survives with horrible scarring. Waking up bandaged in the hospital, the voice confronts Dent again, and then takes over his body, escaping from the hospital after getting a phone call from Carmine. The call turns out to be a trap to lure Dent out to be assassinated for the Holiday killings, but Dent manages to kill the hitmen before being dragged underwater.\n\nAt Carmine's birthday party, he celebrates the supposed death of Holiday, only for Holiday to kill his sister, Carla Viti. Batman interrogates Gilda in order to learn more about Dent, still wanting to help him because of their friendship. Dent meets Solomon Grundy in the sewers and enlists the latter's help to attack the people who've wronged him, attacking the police convoy escorting Sal Maroni to prison. Batman, disguised as an officer, defeats Grundy and confronts Dent with Gordon, who has removed his bandages to reveal his scarred face and his new personality. Gordon accuses Dent of being Holiday, revealing the guns found in his basement, shortly before Maroni is shot by Holiday. Dent, seemingly having deduced who Holiday is, attacks both Batman and Gordon to keep them from giving chase to the killer, and then escapes with Grundy. Batman returns to Wayne Manor, which Alfred prepares for another Halloween, and begins to wonder what the point of his mission is if his parents helped create the criminals he fights; however, Alfred assures him that they would be proud. Dent and Grundy then attack Arkham Asylum, freeing numerous inmates, with the exception of Calendar Man. Batman begins to doubt that Dent was connected to the killings, citing the fact that he supposedly went to Oxford and never told anyone, and later asks Catwoman about her obsession with the Falcone family when she saves him from being shot by Carmine. She reveals that Carmine is her father, and she wants to find out her mother's name.\n\nDent and his associates begin to make their move, with Poison Ivy, Scarecrow and Mad Hatter attacking the streets, distracting the police to allow Dent, Joker, Grundy and Penguin to attack Carmine's building. Batman and Catwoman arrive, subduing most of the rogues. However, Harvey manages to shoot Falcone. Falcone's daughter Sofia runs into the room, picks up the pistol, and tries to shoot Harvey, but his gun had only two bullets. She falls out of a window. Catwoman catches Sofia, but Sofia lets go (probably due to the grief of losing so many family members) and falls to her death. When Catwoman unmasks herself, Falcone says the name, \"Louisa.\", which is probably Selina's birthmother's name. Later, Batman, Gordon, and Dent meet on the rooftop with the Batsignal. Dent confesses to all of the Holiday murders and surrenders to Gordon.\n\nAfter Harvey is placed in Arkham Asylum, Batman visits Gilda. She tells him that she was the Holiday Killer. She was in a relationship with Alberto Falcone when they were students at Oxford. The Falcone family forced the two to get an annulment and forced Gilda to have an abortion, so she wanted revenge on the Falcone family. Gilda wonders if Batman will arrest her or tell Captain Gordon that she is the Holiday Killer. Batman only wants to know if she's done killing people and leaves without telling her his plans.\n\nThe movie ends with a scene at Wayne Manor. Bruce wonders why Alfred still bothers to leave candy for trick-or-treaters. Selina walks downstairs and teases Bruce. The doorbell rings. A family of three--two parents and a boy dressed as Batman--have come to partake in the holiday tradition.\n\nIn the post credits scene, the doorbell rings again. Alfred opens the door and sees The Flash and Green Arrow."

    "Batman: Under the Red Hood": "Ra's al Ghul hires the Joker to help him with his latest terrorist scheme, but soon regrets it when the Clown Prince of Crime kidnaps Robin. In a warehouse in Sarajevo, Bosnia, the Joker beats Robin with a crowbar, ultimately leaving him half-dead on the warehouse floor and leaving a bomb behind to finish him off. Batman arrives too late and Jason is killed in the explosion.\n\nFive years later in Gotham City, the vigilante/crime lord Red Hood has assembled a meeting with the city's top-earning thugs and drug dealers. The Red Hood announces his takeover of the drug trade, demanding 40 percent of their earnings in return for protection from Batman and Black Mask.\n\nAt the docks, Batman is in pursuit of some thugs in a truck. As he tries to interrogate them, the cargo they were carrying opens and reveals Amazo, a powerful android with the ability to copy the abilities of every metahuman it encounters. Nightwing arrives on the scene to help take Amazo down. After defeating the robot, Batman learns that the thugs were working for the Red Hood who promptly kills the thugs with a sniper rifle. Batman chases the Red Hood to the Ace Chemical Plant; the site of the first Red Hood's transformation into the Joker. The current Red Hood rigs an explosion in the plant and escapes.\n\nLater in the Batcave, Batman tells Nightwing that since the Red Hood began his reign of terror, drug trafficking has gone up but crime has come down. In the hopes of learning more, Batman and Nightwing proceed to Arkham Asylum to interrogate the Joker about the Red Hood. The Joker taunts Batman with Jason's death, tempting Batman to kill him, and denies any involvement with his successor.\n\nAt his headquarters, Black Mask is angry because his \"Amazo\" was destroyed, and promptly puts a hit out on the Red Hood before discussing the plans for the next incoming shipment; however, both Batman and the Red Hood have bugged the place and so know of the plans as well. The Red Hood shows up and hijacks a helicopter carrying the shipment but is pursued by Batman and Nightwing. Nightwing notes that the Red Hood is highly skilled and able to evade Batman at every turn, including cutting a Bat-lasso before it even went taut on his leg. The chase leads to a train station above ground and an explosion occurs facilitating the Red Hood's escape.\n\nBatman and Nightwing regroup in the Batcave. Batman and Nightwing agree that the Red Hood's skills, methods, and arsenal are comparable to their own, save that the Red Hood is willing to kill to get what he wants. However, there's something else that troubles Batman, and he stays on his computer monitor to watch the video footage of the chase from the cowl's camcorder, trying to figure out what the Red Hood said at the train station. It reveals that the Red Hood said, \"You haven't lost your touch, Bruce,\" meaning that he knows Batman's true identity. Batman recalls Jason performing the same maneuver he had seen the Red Hood use: cutting a lasso on his leg before it went taut. In addition, a flashback reveals that as he got older Jason grew more violent, not always showing the amount of control as Batman.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the eight crime bosses in league with the Red Hood is being beaten by Black Mask's thugs and about to be burned when the Red Hood intervenes. However it is actually a trap and a group called \"The Fearsome Hand of Four\" attacks the Red Hood who appears beaten, but admits he was merely stalling, hoping Batman would turn up. Batman appears and the two adversaries take on the group together, the Red Hood killing one of his attackers. Batman, implying though not confirming that he knows the Red Hood's identity, asks the Red Hood what has happened to him and offers help. However, the Red Hood replies that it is too late for that, and leaves. For absolute confirmation, a blood sample Batman finds at the scene of the battle and analyses proves to be a match to Jason Todd.\n\nBack at the Black Mask's headquarters, Black Mask learns that his shipment has been destroyed by the Red Hood just before Red Hood shoots a rocket launcher at the Black Mask's office window. However Black Mask survives and is forced to call on the Joker, freeing him from Arkham Acylum and commissioning him to kill the Red Hood.\n\nBack at Wayne Manor, Bruce exhumes Jason's body only to discover it is a fake made of high-end latex. Enraged, he goes to Ra's al Ghul's mansion and demands the truth about Jason. Ra's reveals that he switched Jason's body and revived him in the Lazarus Pit because, as the one who hired the Joker as a distraction from his own activities at the time, he felt responsible for the boy's death. Following his resurrection however, Jason went wild and escaped.\n\nOn his way back to Gotham, Batman finds that the Joker has abducted the Red Hood's crime bosses, including Black Mask, and is about to blow them up. The Red Hood appears, revealing that the Joker has always been his real target and that all of the attacks on Black Mask were to get him desperate enough that he would seek aid from the Joker and arrange his escape from Arkham. Batman arrives, swoops in and tries to take the Joker out with him but the Red Hood grabs on to the Joker and cuts the wire holding them, sending the Joker into the river.\n\nRed Hood then tells Batman to come to Crime Alley if he wants the Joker back while, in an abandoned apartment, the Red Hood beats the Joker with a crowbar. After meeting in Crime Alley, Red Hood and Batman fight it out and end up in the apartment where the Joker is being held. Jason confronts Batman saying that, though he has forgiven him for not saving him five years ago, he cannot understand why Batman did not kill the Joker for what he did. Batman confesses that, though he always wanted to kill the Joker, he will not allow himself the pleasure for fear that there would be \"no going back\". Jason then tosses Batman a gun, telling him he must either kill the Joker or kill him. When Batman refuses, Jason shoots at Batman. He misses and Batman throws a batarang into the barrel of the gun causing the gun to explode in Jason's hand. Jason then sets off a bomb he had previously planted in the room. The bomb goes off and though Batman and the Joker seem relatively unharmed, Jason's body is nowhere to be found.\n\nThe Joker is sent back to Arkham, Black Mask is set free on a million dollar bail and in the Batcave, Alfred asks Batman if he should remove the memorial display case containing Jason's Robin uniform. Batman says no, explaining that nothing has changed between Jason and him while a quick flashback show Jason Todd's first time in his Robin costume, with the boy declaring that it is the best day of his life."

    "Batman: Year One": "Bruce Wayne returns home to Gotham City from training abroad in martial arts, man hunting, and science for the past 12 years, and James Gordon is a cop who moves to Gotham with his pregnant wife, Barbara, after a transfer from Chicago. Both are swiftly acquainted with the corruption and violence of Gotham City, with Gordon witnessing his partner Detective Flass assaulting a teen for fun.\n\nOn a surveillance mission in the seedy East End, teenage prostitute Holly Robinson propositions a disguised Wayne. He is drawn into a brawl with her pimp and several prostitutes, including dominatrix Selina Kyle. One of the two reporting police officers shoot him without provocation and take him in their squad car, but a dazed and bleeding Bruce maneuvers his handcuffed hands in front of himself, and demands the police get out. The cops try to subdue him, but the ensuing struggle causes the police car to careen out of control, and flips. Bruce flees, but not before dragging the police to a safe distance. He reaches Wayne Manor barely alive and sits before his father's bust, requesting guidance in his war on crime. A bat crashes through a window and settles on the bust, giving him inspiration.\n\nGordon works to rid corruption from the force, but on orders from Commissioner Gillian Loeb, several officers attack him, including Flass, who threatens Gordon's pregnant wife. In revenge, Gordon tracks Flass down, beats and humiliates him, leaving him naked and handcuffed in the snow.\n\nAs Gordon becomes a minor celebrity for several brave acts, Batman strikes for the first time, attacking a group of thieves. Batman soon works up the ladder, even attacking Flass while he was accepting a bribe. After Batman interrupts a dinner party attended by many of Gotham's corrupt politicians and crime bosses, including Carmine \"The Roman\" Falcone, Loeb orders Gordon to bring him in by any means necessary.\n\nAs Gordon tries in vain to catch him, Batman attacks Falcone, stripping him naked and tying him up in his bed after dumping his car in the river. Assistant district attorney Harvey Dent becomes Batman's first ally.\n\nDetective Sarah Essen suggests Wayne as a Batman suspect and she and Gordon witness Batman save an old woman from a runaway truck. Essen holds Batman at gunpoint, but Batman disarms her and flees to an abandoned building. Loeb fraudulently orders a bomb dropped on it, forcing Batman into the fortified basement. A trigger-happy SWAT team led by Branden is sent in, whom Batman attempts to trap in the basement. Branden manages to climb out of the trap through a collapsed chimney and joins in the gun battle. Enraged as the team's careless gunfire injures several people outside, Batman beats the team into submission. Using a device to attract the bats of his cave, Batman escapes amid the chaos. Selina Kyle, after witnessing him in action, dons a costume of her own to begin the life as costumed thief Catwoman.\n\nGordon has a brief affair with Essen, while Batman intimidates a drug dealer for information. The dealer goes to Gordon to testify against Flass, who is brought up on charges. Loeb blackmails Gordon with proof of his affair against pressing charges. After taking Barbara with him to investigate Wayne's connection to Batman, Gordon confesses the affair to her.\n\nBatman sneaks into Falcone's manor and overhears a plan against Gordon but is interrupted when Catwoman, hoping to build a reputation after her robberies were pinned on Batman, attacks Falcone and his bodyguards, aided by Batman. Identifying Falcone's plan as the morning comes, the normal Bruce leaves to help Gordon.\n\nGordon tries to rebuild the relationships with his family after Essen leaves Gotham. While leaving home Gordon spots a motorcyclist enter his garage. Suspicious, Gordon enters to see Johnny Vitti (Falcone's nephew) and his thugs holding his family hostage. Gordon realizes if he lets them go, they will most likely kill his wife and son. Therefore, Gordon shoots the thugs and chases Vitti, who has fled with the baby. Bruce Wayne, on a motorcycle, also rushes to chase Vitti. Gordon blows out Vitti's car tire on a bridge and the two fights, with Gordon losing his glasses, before Vitti and James Gordon Jr. fall over the side. Bruce leaps over the railing and saves the baby. Gordon realizes that he is standing before an unmasked Batman but says that he is \"practically blind without glasses,\" and lets Bruce go.\n\nGordon and his wife start attending marriage counseling, and he ends with a final monologue: \"It turns out that Flass is smarter than he looks, took notes on every little talk he had with Loeb\" ... \"there's a real panic on, somebody has threatened to poison the Gotham reservoir,\" who calls himself \"The Joker.\" Gordon, standing on a rooftop, anticipates a friend coming, whom he believes able to help, implying it is Batman."

    "Battle Beyond the Stars": "The farmers of the peaceful planet Akir are threatened by the tyrannical warlord Sador (John Saxon), who rules the sinister Malmori Empire. Sador's huge ship carries a weapon called the Stellar Converter, which turns planets into small stars. He threatens to use the Stellar Converter unless the planet submits to him when he returns in several days. Zed (Jeff Corey), the last of the famous Akira Corsairs, is elderly and nearly blind. He suggests that they hire mercenaries to protect the planet. Lacking valuable resources, they can only offer food and shelter in payment. Unable to go himself, Zed offers his ship, which has an artificial intelligence navigation and tactical computer named Nell, for the job if they can find a pilot. The ship is fast and well-armed but cannot defeat Sador alone. Shad (Richard Thomas), a young man who has piloted the ship and is well known to Nell, volunteers for the recruiting mission.\n\nShad's first stop is the Hephaestus space station, which repairs androids. Expecting to find weapons, Shad instead finds only two humans among the androids: Doctor Hephaestus (Sam Jaffe), whose life support has turned him into a cyborg, and his beautiful daughter Nanelia (Darlanne Fluegel). The doctor attempts to force Shad to mate with his daughter. Shad doesn't want to abandon his people, and escapes, with Nanelia following in her own ship. Although she has no weapons, her highly advanced computer systems might be useful. The two separate to look for more mercenaries. Shad comes across Space Cowboy (George Peppard), a spacegoing truck driver from Earth who is ambushed by Space Jackers while delivering a shipment of laser guns to the planet Umateal. Shad fights off the Jackers, thus saving Cowboy's life twice over; they arrive at Umateal just before they watch Sador destroy the planet with his weapon. Lacking the fuel to carry the weapons back home, Cowboy offers to deliver them to Akir. Shad talks Cowboy into sharing his gunslinging experience with the Akira.\n\nLater, Shad meets a set of five alien clones who share a group consciousness named Nestor. They admit their life is incredibly dull, since their whole race shares one mind. In order to be entertained, they have sent five members to join Shad's cause. Nestor does not require payment, saying they are completely self-sufficient. Next, Shad recruits Gelt (Robert Vaughn), a wealthy assassin who is so well known he cannot show his face on any civilized planet. Gelt offers his services in trade for the ability to live peacefully hiding among the Akira. Gelt's ship is highly maneuverable and well armed. On his way back to Akir, Shad is approached by Saint-Exmin (Sybil Danning), of the Valkyrie warriors. She is a headstrong woman looking to prove herself in battle. She pilots a small, but extremely fast ship with enhanced firepower. Shad finds her annoying and wishes she would go away, but she tags along.\n\nWhile waiting for Shad's return, Nanelia is captured by a reptilian slaver named Cayman. Cayman possesses a powerful ship with an eclectic crew of aliens. She quickly recruits Cayman to their cause when he learns that they are looking for mercenaries to fight against Sador. The only payment Cayman wants is Sador's head, since Sador's forces had destroyed Cayman's homeworld years ago. The fleet of seven ships return to Akir. Upon reaching the planet's surface, the heroes are greeted with caution by the natives, who are not used to violent species. Eventually, Sador returns, but his armada of attack fighters is intercepted by Shad and his hired warriors. In the opening battle, Gelt skillfully destroys several of Sador's ships but is mortally wounded when his ship crashes. Meanwhile, Cowboy and the Akiran natives, armed with his laser guns, fight off Sador's invading ground forces.\n\nSador survives an assassination attempt by one of the captured Nestors and launches all of his ships in retaliation against the planet. The Akira ground troops, lead by Cowboy, defeat Sador's army, but Zed is killed in the fighting. There is another huge space battle and the mercenaries' ships are destroyed one by one. However, the mercenaries are successful in destroying all of Sador's star fighters and the Stellar Converter, leaving only Sador's flagship. Piloting Nell, Shad and Nanelia are captured by the flagship in a tractor beam. The pair escape in a lifepod after Shad orders Nell to activate the ship's self-destruct program. Sador's flagship is destroyed in the explosion. As Shad and Nanelia return to Akir, Nanelia despairs over the deaths of their friends. Shad tells her that the Akira believe that no one is truly dead when they have been dearly loved and remembered by the living. The Akira will remember the sacrifices made by the mercenaries and honor them forever."

    "Battle Royale": "The story opens with a frantic news broadcast about a young girl being brought back to mainland Japan after she wins the latest \"Battle Royale\", a contest that pits high school students against each other in a fight to the death on a remote island. While being filmed, the girl smiles.\n\nShuya Nanahara, a Japanese middle school student, attempts to cope with life after his father's suicide by hanging. Meanwhile, schoolmate Noriko Nakagawa is the only student attending class -- 3-B. Their teacher, Kitano, quietly leaves upon her tardy, apologetic arrival, but is attacked by student Yoshitoki Kuninobu and resigns after recovering from his wound.\n\nOne year later, class 3-B takes a field trip after completing their compulsory studies; however, the class is gassed on their bus. They wake up in a \"briefing room\" on a remote island, wearing strange electronic collars. Kitano explains that the class has been chosen to participate in this year's Battle Royale as a result of the BR Act, which was passed after 800,000 students walked out of school. The orientation video cheerfully instructs the class to kill each other for three days until only one student remains. Students resistant to their rules or entering one of the randomly placed \"death zones\" for each day are to be killed by the collar's detonation. One of the 42 students, Fumiyo Fujiyoshi, interferes with the video by whispering to her friends; Kitano kills her on the spot with a thrown knife. While a shocked class is subdued by soldiers, Kuninobu openly confronts the viciousness of Kitano and the teacher slashes him with a knife (in the back of leg - the same area Kuninobu attacked Kitano two years earlier) before detonating his collar while Shuya, his best friend, watches in horror. Each student is provided a bag of food and water, map of the island, compass, and one item containing either a lethal weapon (firearm, kama (sickle), knife, potassium cyanide) or an item apparently worthless toward survival (paper fan, binoculars, coat hanger, saucepan lid). The weapons are supposed to eliminate any natural advantage any one student might have over the others.\n\nThe program's first six hours see twelve deaths, four of which are suicides. Brazen, mute \"exchange student\" Kazuo Kiriyama and quietly deranged classmate Mitsuko Souma soon become the most dangerous players in the game, while another exchange student, Shogo Kawada seems somewhat more merciful. Shuya promises to keep Noriko safe for Kuninobu because he was in love with her, but never told her. Other students have various goals in the game: Shinji Mimura and his friends plot to hack into the military's computer systems and destroy their base of operations; Hiroki Sugimura searches for his best friend Takako Chigusa and his love interest Kayoko Kotohiki. Chigusa runs into Kazushi Niida, who is sexually obsessed with her; Chigusa kills him after he attempts forcing himself on her, but is herself killed by Mitsuko. Kawada teams with Shuya and Noriko, and reveals that he won a previous Battle Royale at the cost of his girlfriend, Keiko; he now swears vengeance. The trio are forced to separate when Kiriyama attacks, and Sugimura rescues Shuya, assisted by his assigned \"weapon,\" a GPS tracking device.\n\nShuya awakens bandaged by Yukie Utsumi in the island's lighthouse, where she helps reorient him to the events of the past 14 hours; five other girls on the school's cheerleading squad have also been guarding and hiding out in the building, apparently since the beginning of the program. Utsumi gathers the girls around the dining table to weigh in on a possible method of escape from the island which Shuya has informed her of. Yuko Sakaki, thinking that Shuya murdered a friend of hers, attempts to poison Shuya's food, but it is inadvertently eaten by one of the girls, killing her and sparking a massive, fear-fueled gunfight resulting in all the girls' deaths -- except Yuko. She realises the enormity of her paranoia and commits suicide, jumping from the deck of the lighthouse.\n\nShuya returns to Noriko and Kawada, and they set out to find Mimura's group. To a small warehouse, Sugimura tracks down Kotohiki, who panics and kills him shortly after; Sugimura professes his love before dying. Kotohiki cries in despair, and is found and killed by Mitsuko. Watching from the rafters, Kiriyama then guns down and kills Mitsuko after she sadly dispenses some fitting advice to her two (dead) classmates.\n\nUpon the rapidly-consecutive deaths of Sugimura, Kotohiki and Souma, all of the seven students remaining are either preparing or willing to completely subvert the operations of the \"game\" - save for the psychopathic Kazuo. \"The Third Man\", a hacker group consisting of Mimura, Iijima and Yutaka, successfully infiltrate the military's computer system and prepare to destroy the perimeter using a truck converted into a fire-bomb. However, at the last second they are found by Kiriyama, who kills them all, but one of them manages to detonate the truck, seriously injuring the killer. When Kawada, Noriko and Shuya arrive at the hackers' burning base, Kawada confronts and kills the shrapnel-blinded, Uzi-armed Kiriyama with his SPAS-12 shotgun.\n\nOn the morning of the final day, Kawada, aware of the collars' internal microphones, takes Shuya and Noriko aside and fakes their deaths. Suspecting that Kawada has won through manipulation of the BR system, Kitano ends the game and dismisses the troops before establishing final protocol, intent on personally killing the young man. Kitano realizes that Kawada, and not Mimura, has hacked into the game's intranet system months beforehand, and has now disabled Shuya and Noriko's tracking devices. Kitano unveils a homemade painting of the dead students, with Noriko indicated as the winner. He reveals that he was unable to bear the mutual hatred between him and his students, having been rejected by his daughter, Shiori. He also confesses that he always thought of Noriko as a daughter. He asks the confused, reluctant Noriko to kill him, but is quickly shot by Shuya after he threatens her at gunpoint. As he falls, Kitano shoots, and it is shown that the weapon in his hand was a mere water-gun. Suddenly, his phone rings, and Kitano sits down to answer it, telling Shiori that \"if you hate someone, you take the consequences\" before finally dying. Shuya, Noriko and Kawada leave the island on a boat, but Kawada dies from injuries sustained in his gunfight with Kiriyama -- \"glad\" that in the end, he \"found true friends.\"\n\nShuya and Noriko are declared fugitive murderers, and last seen on the run in the direction of Tokyo's Shibuya train station."

    "Battle for Terra": "Mala (Evan Rachel Wood) is a precocious girl living on the beautiful planet Terra, a place where peace and tolerance are celebrated. Unbeknownst to Mala and her fellow Terrians, the last inhabitants of Earth have exhausted the resources of their planet and those of three others, and are now searching for a new home. This Earthforce has discovered that the use of a Terraformer will make Terra habitable for humans but poisonous for Terrians. When the Earthlings embark on a hostile invasion of Terra, Mala's father, Roven (Dennis Quaid), is kidnapped. Hoping to save her father, Mala captures and hides a crashed human pilot named Jim (Luke Wilson). While Mala nurses Jim back to health, the two forge a friendship and a plan that could save both the human race and the planet of Terra. Soon, however, they realize that peace will not be secured unless they can combat both the Terraformer and dark political forces that will stop at nothing in their drive to achieve power for power's sake.While Terra's message that peace is a question of free will and choice is a potent one, the exuberance of Mala and her young friends carries the film. Director Aristomenis Tsirbas paints a landscape of pastoral pleasure, and our admiration for Terra's idyllic vistas is only heightened when they are invaded-martykz-2\n\nOn a distant planet, Mala and her best friend Senn, members of a sentient, tadpole-like species, skip class to joyride in wooden flying machines that resemble hang gliders. The pair soar above the dense cloud cover of their world, which teems with life, interacting with flying creatures similar to whales and rays. Following a dangerous incident in which Mala is nearly sucked into a \"wind tunnel\" (a large cave that draws in and blasts out strong gusts of air), Senn tells her that the two of them should cease their exploring and head back home. Mala pauses near the boundary of a group of statues which rise above the clouds and hold up their hands in a blocking pose; Senn claims that area is forbidden to them.\n\nA defiant Mala is about to investigate further when an enormous shadow sweeps across the clouds. She and Senn look up to discover that a huge object has appeared in the sky, so large that it almost completely blocks out the light of the sun. This sight finally prompts Mala to return with Senn.\n\nIn the treetop city that is Mala's home, the people ponder the meaning of the object's appearance, some claiming that it is a \"new god\". When Mala herself asks her father Roven about it, he dismissively replies that it will be \"whatever the Elders say it is\". The inquisitive Mala is not satisfied with this answer, and says that she could build a tool with which to better observe the object; however, Roven warns her that no inventions may be constructed without the approval of the Elders because that is the law. Mala declares that perhaps the law is wrong, and Roven orders her to her room. As Mala turns to leave, she observes Roven handling a woodcarving of himself, Mala, and an adult female, revealing that Roven is a widower, and that his wife is missed by both of them.\n\nThat night, as Roven sleeps, Mala disobeys him, using her workshop to build a telescope. She ventures out into the darkness to get a clear look at the object, discovering that is a space vessel of some kind, and that several smaller, bright objects are approaching from its direction. Metallic fighter craft swarm into the city and begin abducting residents with green beams of light. Many people view this as validation that the visitors are in fact gods, and allow themselves to be taken. Mala witnesses Roven being abducted, and blames herself, believing that she drew the ire of the \"gods\" by violating the Elders' decree against new technology. Determined to join her father, she tries to attract the attention of one of the fighters by flying in front of it in her glider, but rather than abduct her, it attempts to shoot her down. Mala maneuvers the fighter out of the city and in front of the wind tunnel, which sucks the fighter up and then spits it back out, damaged and unable to fly. Mala ventures toward the downed ship and narrowly avoids being shot by the injured pilot, a human male who calls her a \"monster\" before passing out. The name on his uniform reads: \"Lt. James Stanton\".\n\nUnder cover of darkness, Mala takes Stanton back to her home. She is visited by an Elder, Orin, who does not notice Stanton. Orin inquires as to Roven's whereabouts and informs Mala that the visitors are not gods, but invaders, and assures her that appropriate measures are being taken. Once Orin leaves, Mala returns to Stanton and begins to examine him. She reaches for a device on his belt, but is stopped by a small robot (later identified as \"Giddy\") that enters through her window and warns her that Stanton is dying. When a shocked Mala asks how Giddy knows her language, he replies that he has studied the linguistics of her people. He asks her to save Stanton's life, but Mala refuses unless Giddy teaches her Stanton's language so that she will be able to communicate with him and ask about her father. Giddy reluctantly agrees, looking into Mala's eyes and uploading the relevant information directly into her brain. Giddy tells Mala that Stanton requires oxygen to survive, as the gauge on his belt is almost empty. Under Giddy's instructions, Mala is able to locate an oxygen-producing plant and construct a crude oxygen tent just in time to prevent Stanton from suffocating.\n\nAfter a time, Stanton awakens. He is displeased that Giddy has taught Mala the human language without his authorization, and even moreso when Giddy informs him that his fighter was damaged in the crash and will not be able to fly without replacement parts. Mala demands to be taken to see her father, but Stanton ignores her, seeing other human fighters flying through the city, presumably searching for him. Stanton rushes outside and attempts to get their attention, but promptly succumbs to the effects of Terra's atmosphere and nearly falls to his death before being rescued by Mala and Giddy. As Stanton recovers, Giddy explains to Mala that humans once lived upon the planet Earth. As humans gradually depleted Earth of its resources, they terraformed and then colonized the neighboring worlds of Mars and Venus. Eventually, however, the colonies on Mars and Venus declared their independence from Earth, resulting in a war that destroyed all three planets. The few survivors had no choice but to travel to the nearest world capable of supporting life: Mala's planet, which the humans have named \"Terra\".\n\nStanton awakens to find that Mala has constructed a small, rotating model of Earth and its moon as a gift to him, using Giddy's information as a guide. Stanton is impressed by Mala's workmanship and realizes that she may be skilled enough to craft the parts he needs to repair his fighter. He tells Mala that if she helps him, he will take her to see her father, and she readily agrees. Working through the night with Giddy's aid, Mala machines the necessary parts, and although they are not as sturdy as the originals, Stanton believes they could still work. The two of them prepare to set out for the crashed fighter; Stanton refills his oxygen supply while Mala builds a respirator for herself that will allow her to breathe in an oxygen atmosphere.\n\nAs they prepare to depart, Senn unexpectedly arrives. He has grown concerned because Mala has locked herself up for days (while tending to Stanton) and he has missed her. As Senn ventures inside, despite Mala's attempts to ward him away, he is immediately confronted and choked by a battle-ready Stanton, who backs off only after Mala pleads for him to stop. Panicked by the encounter and the presence of an invader in Mala's home, Senn rushes off to inform Orin. Stanton is disturbed by Mala's willingness to protect himself and Giddy, even though they are aliens to her world. He and Mala quickly leave as Orin and his guards approach with Senn. Senn spots Mala as she departs, but merely smiles at her, and does not inform her pursuers. As Mala and Stanton make their way out of the city, they observe the Terranians engaged in performing the \"Festival of Life\", which Mala explains is a celebration of life and all the things it brings. Suddenly, the city erupts in a series of fireballs as it comes under bombardment from human ships. Mala asks Stanton why this is happening, and he replies that he does not know, claiming that \"it wasn't supposed to be this way\", and lamenting that he has trained for battle all his life only to be called upon to make war with a people who know only peace.\n\nMala and Stanton return to the crash site only to discover that someone has moved the ship. Giddy is able to track the wreckage, and the trio follow the trail into the area that has been designated as forbidden by the Terranian Elders. Here beneath the clouds, on the ground level of the planet, is an ancient, ruined Terranian city that Mala has never seen before. They venture deeper into the ruins, discovering a detailed mural depicting Terranians at war with each other, prompting Stanton to note that perhaps their species are not so dissimilar after all. They observe a Terranian ship landing upon a platform, and hide beneath it as it descends into an underground base that is obviously more technologically advanced than Mala's treetop village, and is also where Stanton's fighter is being held. Mala and Stanton find themselves surrounded by armed guards, but Stanton is able to stall for time by pretending to hold Mala hostage while Giddy repairs the ship. The three of them take refuge in the cockpit while Stanton fires up the engine; the guards attack, but are unable to cause significant damage to the fighter. After a few false starts, Stanton is able to get the ship going, piloting it out of the hidden base and into space.\n\nMala is able to get her first good look at the human ship: the Ark, a gigantic, rotating, gyroscope-like vessel that is home to all the human refugees from Earth. Mala is impressed by the sight, but Stanton says that the Ark is in worse shape than it looks. After several generations of travel from Earth to Terra, the Ark has steadily deteriorated, and is now literally falling apart; even as Stanton makes his docking approach, a section of the ship abruptly depressurizes. Once safely docked, Stanton instructs Mala to remain with the fighter, and that he will return shortly, promising to take her to her father when he does. Stanton is treated for minor injuries he sustained on Terra and debriefed about his knowledge of the native population, but his superiors are more interested in the Terranians' ability to defend themselves than in their art or culture. Stanton is reunited with his brother Stewart who tells him that everyone on the Ark is excited about his return, and that even General Hemmer wants to meet with him. Hemmer, the hawkish leader of the Earth Force military, speaks with the leading human council about the planned invasion of Terra. Council President Chen criticizes Hemmer's plan, claiming that it amounts to conquering the planet. Hemmer argues that the latest hull breach on the Ark killed 12 people, and with the ship falling deeper into disrepair each day, the time for decisive action is now. Chen replies that Hemmer's plan is \"under consideration\", and a disgusted Hemmer leaves to meet with Stanton, praising him as a war hero. Stanton disagrees and expresses his reservations about provoking an armed conflict with the peaceful Terranians, while Hemmer notes that many members of Stanton's squadron have died due to accidents and mechanical failures aboard the Ark, and that securing \"the prize\" of Terra will bring an end to such needless deaths.\n\nMeanwhile, Mala grows weary of waiting for Stanton to return. Taking his laser pistol, she sets out aboard the Ark to locate her father. She stumbles into a cold storage chamber where numerous captive Terranians are being held in cryogenic stasis; horrified, she quickly escapes into a boiler room, where she finds her weakened, ailing father strapped to a gurney, presumably waiting to be incinerated. The two are quickly discovered by humans, and after telling his daughter that he loves her, Roven shoves her out of the hatch and back into the cold storage chamber, but not before taking Stanton's laser pistol from her. Firing wildly, Roven causes the boiler room to depressurize, ejecting himself and two humans out into space. Mala watches the entire display through an opening in the hatch; having now lost both of her parents, she is devastated, and slumps to the floor before being taken prisoner by humans. Hemmer uses security footage of the incident as proof that the Terranians are hostile and as justification for an invasion. The council wishes to debate the matter further, but Hemmer says that he has already waited patiently for the council to act, and they have not done so. As armed guards enter the council chamber, Hemmer launches a coup, announcing that he is assuming command of the Earth Force government, that future generations will judge his actions, and that it is only because of him that there will be any future generations at all.\n\nHemmer wishes for Stanton, as the first war hero of the campaign, to lead the assault on Terra. Stanton, however, continues to express his reluctance about attacking the peaceful natives, stating that there must be alternatives. Hemmer informs Stanton that the damage to the Ark is so severe that the ship only has two months' worth of oxygen remaining, and that action must be taken. Hemmer's plan is to take the main terraforming unit that produces air on the Arka large, spider-like mechanismand implant it onto the surface of Terra. Enough breathable air will remain on the Ark to last a few weeks, but within one week, the terraformer will convert the entire atmosphere of Terra to an oxygen-based one, making the planet habitable for humans. If the plan works, mankind will have a new home; if it doesn't, the entire human race will die out. The consequence of this plan, however, is that all the native life on Terra, to which oxygen is poisonous, will be destroyed.\n\nTo test Stanton's loyalties, Hemmer shows him a room that has been pressurized with Terranian atmosphere, and in which Mala has been imprisoned. Hemmer then has Stewart thrown into the chamber, and he quickly begins to suffocate as Mala panics and pleads for someone to help him. Stanton can press a button to fill the room with oxygen and save Stewart's life, but doing so will kill Mala. Stanton hesitates, but presses the button; as Mala begins to choke, he covertly orders Giddy to save her. Giddy uses a laser to cut through the window into the chamber, causing it to depressurize; the resulting explosion knocks out the humans present and allows Giddy to retrieve Mala's respirator. Mala initially believes that Stanton has betrayed her, and quickly flees back to his fighter. With Giddy's assistance, she is able to pilot the fighter away from the Ark, although the ship's defenses shoot her down, and she is forced to eject after entering the atmosphere. Mala falls a long distance to the ground, and loses consciousness.\n\nAboard the Ark, Stanton explains Giddy's actions as a malfunction, an explanation of which Hemmer is suspicious, but is willing to accept. He orders Stanton to take part in the \"terraforming campaign\" on the planet. Stewart apologizes for what happened with Mala, claiming that Hemmer said it was the only way they could be sure of Stanton's loyalties. Stanton tells his brother that he will always look out for him, but that he should question if Hemmer will do the same. On Terra, Mala awakes to find herself in the company of Senn and Orin in the same complex that she and Stanton discovered earlier. Orin explains that long ago, the people of Terra made war upon each other, and almost destroyed their entire species. A small group of survivors formed the Elders, who resolved to make the future a peaceful one by keeping the past a secret and forbidding any knowledge of advanced technology. Now, however, with the Earth Force invasion imminent, that ban is being lifted; Mala sees the Terranians' simple wooden gliders being replaced by sleek metal warships with advanced laser weapons. Mala asks where Giddy is, and is told that he is being held captive; although Orin cannot release him, because he is a \"tool of the enemy\", he will allow Mala to speak with him. Terranian technicians wish to \"dissect\" Giddy in order to learn his knowledge of the humans' battle plan, but Mala says they should simply ask him instead. Giddy claims that even though Stanton ordered him to protect her, he cannot act against Earth Force because they created him. Realizing that Stanton never betrayed her after all, Mala asks Giddy if he intends to disobey Stanton's order; without his assistance, Earth Force will kill everyone on Terra, including her. Giddy puzzles over Mala's logic, but agrees to help. Both sides prepare for war; Earth Force orchestrates the defense of the terraformer while Giddy reveals its weak points to the Terranians.\n\nThe terraformer is launched to the planet's surface and immediately begins producing oxygen. The battle begins and the fighting is fierce, with casualties on both sides. Earth Force, having expected to encounter only primitive weapons, is unprepared for the Terranians' more advanced fighters. Following Giddy's instructions, the Terranians attack the air filters on the terraformer, reducing its ability to create oxygen. In response, Hemmer orders the oxygen production process to be accelerated; although hazardous, this will speed up the rate of atmospheric conversion from days to minutes. More and more of the terraformer's filters are damaged, and the battle briefly tilts in favor of the Terranians before Earth Force reinforcements arrive from the Ark. As the terraformer produces more and more oxygen and begins to poison the nearby Terranian city, Mala witnesses Senn's ship shot down by a human fighter and pursues it in a rage; she realizes that the pilot is Stanton's brother Stewart, but does not stop her attack. Stanton himself joins the battle, feeling he has no choice, and responds to Stewart's distress call, but freezes upon seeing the attacker is Mala. Unwilling to either abandon his brother or kill his friend, Stanton takes his only option, interposing his ship between theirs and launching his missiles at the terraformer. The resulting explosion destroys the terraformer as it is on the verge of completing the atmospheric conversion. Both Hemmer and Stanton are killed in the blast, while Mala and Stewart barely escape. With the terraformer destroyed, the remaining Earth Force ships retreat back to the Ark; the battle for Terra is over, and the humans have lost.\n\nIn her village, Mala joins in the victory celebration, learning that Senn survived the crash of his ship. Orin credits her with winning the battle, but Mala says it was Stanton's actions that saved them all. Mala is relieved that her people have survived, but is also saddened by the plight of the humans; she dejectedly notes that without any food, water, or air, they can do nothing but wait to die. However, Orin reminds her that there are always other options.\n\nSome time later, Mala and Senn are seen flying above the clouds once more, as they were at the beginning of the film; this time they are joined by Stewart, piloting an Earth Force fighter, who offers Mala a salute before flying through a hatch in a massive dome similar to the oxygen tent Mala constructed for Stanton. It is here that the humans from the Ark have established a new colony, using Terra's oxygen-producing plants and opening diplomatic relations with the native Terranians; Orin is seen meeting with President Chen. Stewart flies high above the budding colony, observing a statue that is still under construction: it is a memorial to his brother, who is being remembered as a true hero. [D-Man2010]"

    "Battle for the Planet of the Apes": "Set in a flashback in the former North American continent of the early 21st century in the year 2003, told by the Great Lawgiver in the year 2670, this latest Planet of the Apes sequel focuses on the chimpanzee ape leader, Caesar (Roddy McDowall), more then a decade after he led the ape revolution in the previous film, 'Conquest of the Planet of the Apes'. In this post-nuclear war society, Caesar tries to cultivate peace between his simian peers and the surviving remains of humanity. A militant gorilla general named Aldo (Claude Akins) however opposes this. Therefore, he plots Caesar's overthrow and doom. Caesar is now married to the chimpanzee Lisa (Natalie Trundy), the female chimpanzee ape of the previous film, and they have a son, named Cornelius (Bobby Porter) in honor of Caesar's late father.\n\nCaesar regrets having never known his parents until his human assistant MacDonald (Austin Stoker) informs him that by viewing video taped archives of his parents, he can learn about the future. Caesar learns the archives are in the Forbidden City, once the city in which Caesar was enslaved, and is now in nuclear ruins.\n\nAfter obtaining weapons from an armory run by the orangutan Mandemus (Lew Ayres), Caesar travels with MacDonald and his orangutan advisor Virgil (Paul Williams) to the Forbidden City and sneaks in to find the recorded archives. However, there are radiation-scarred humans still living in the Forbidden City, now under the command of Governor Kolp (Severn Darden), the former police chief under the late Governor Beck and who is now the current leader and governor. Caesar and his party view the video and audio recordings of Cornelius and Zira (from 'Escape from the Planet of the Apes') and learn about the future of the world, but barely have enough time to study the tapes before they must escape or risk capture or death.\n\nBack in Ape City, Caesar assembles a meeting with the citizens to report his discoveries at the Forbidden City. Aldo objects when some humans show up at the meeting and leads the gorillas away.\n\nIn the Forbidden City, a three-man scout group sent by Governor Kolp return and tell them about the Ape City. Kolp considers this clandestine entrance by Caesar an act of espionage while his subordinate M\u00e9ndez (Paul Stevens) says that they did nothing wrong and should be allowed to go in peace. Governor Kolp then declares war on Ape City, mustering the mutant humans from the Forbidden City to destroy the ape society once and for all.\n\nThat night, Aldo is furious over the fact that Caesar wants to co-exist peacefully with humans and plots a military coup in order to install himself as the leader of Ape City. Cornelius (while climbing a tree) overhears this when trying to catch his pet squirrel, but is spotted by Aldo who hacks at the branch with his sword causing Cornelius to fall to the ground and suffer serious injuries and he becomes bedridden. After one of the ape scouts is wounded by Governor Kolp, Aldo takes action into his own hands and orders all humans rounded into the corral. Then, Aldo leads the gorillas to loot Mandemus' armory for its weapons.\n\nThe next morning, Cornelius succumbs to his wounds leaving Caesar devastated. Upon learning about Aldo's actions from Virgil, Caesar leaves Cornelius's side to confront Aldo, but Kolp's ragtag force of mutant humans launches their attack against Ape City at that moment delaying Caesar's and Aldo's confrontation until after the battle as both Caesar and Aldo are forced to team up to fight the attacking mutant humans.\n\nThe mutants attack on Ape City initially succeeds after an artillery barrage destroys or damages many homes and buildings, forcing Caesar to order the defenders to fall back. When Kolp finds Caesar lying wounded among st the apes on the ground, he taunts him saying the apes would once again be humanity's slaves or die, and is about to shoot him. But then Lisa cries out, and Kolp is distracted. Caesar shouts, \"Now, fight like apes!,\" and most of the fallen apes all around them, who were feigning death (clearly on Caesar's orders) or hiding, launch a counter-attack that captures most of the mutants and drives Kolp into retreat. Kolp and his remaining forces are killed by Aldo and his mounted troops in the open while trying to escape in a school bus.\n\nAfter the battle, Aldo wants to kill all the humans in the pen, but Caesar shields them for they were not part of Kolp's army and thus killed nobody. Aldo declares that Caesar should be killed if he shields the humans. But before he can carry this out, he lets it slip that Cornelius' death was not due to an accident, but Aldo's malevolence. The ape community immediately grows angry and concludes that the society's sacred law (\"ape must never kill ape\") has been broken. As the community repeats \"ape has killed ape!\", an infuriated Caesar pursues Aldo up a large tree, and their fight results in Aldo's death when he falls. Caesar then goes to free the humans, but they refuse to leave the pen unless things change. MacDonald insists that freedom is meaningless without being treated as equals. Caesar then realizes the apes are just as evil and despicable as the former slave-owners if they treat the humans as second class citizens. The apes and humans then decide to co-exist with one another and begin to work side-by-side in rebuilding their community and make a new society. They store their guns in the armory; Caesar and Virgil reluctantly explain to Mandemas that they will still need their weapons for future conflicts and can only wait for the day when they will no longer need them.\n\n(Note: it is implied by viewers that Aldo was originally the ape that led the revolution that overthrew human society, but due to the fact that Caesar's late parents, Cornelius and Zira, had arrived on Earth from the future and had conceived Caesar, that they actually changed the course of history and the time line that has resulted in Caesar leading the ape revolution instead of Aldo whom only played a minor part in it. With Caesar finally being aware of all this, and Aldo now dead and gone, he and the apes and humans can now create their own future of what they will make of it.)\n\nIn the final scene, the wizened orangutan teacher at the beginning of the film, known in ape society as the Great Lawgiver (John Huston), finishes the narration begun in the prologue all about the life of the late great chimpanzee leader Caesar who united the world in peace... to a mixed group of young human and ape children in an outdoor classroom. The setting is now the year 2670, over 600 years in the future. In complete contrast to the first 'Planet of the Apes' movie, instead of humanity falling and apes rising to take their place as the dominant species on Earth, the two species have continued to co-exist. The Lawgiver notes that their society still waits for a day when their world will no longer need weapons, while they \"wait with hope\". When asked by a human child at what the future will hold and if man and ape will continue to live together in peace (among the next 1,300 years before the first 'Planet of the Apes' movie thus bringing the series full circle), the Lawgiver states that only the dead know about the future. The final shot zooms over to a life-size stone statue of Caesar and shows a single tear falling from the statue's left eye... (implying that peaceful coexistence of apes and humans will not last forever)."

    "Battle in Seattle": "Its November 1999, and five days are about to rock the world as tens of thousands of demonstrators take to the streets of Seattle in protest of the World Trade Organizations Ministerial Meeting. Among them are Django (Andre Benjamin), Sam (Jennifer Carpenter), Lou (Michelle Rodriguez) and Jay (Martin Henderson). Each has a unique story, but they're united in a common desire to be heard and to make a difference in the world. For these four protesters, this is very personal and the stakes are higher than mere politics.\n\nA peaceful demonstration to stop the WTO talks quickly escalates into a full-scale riot, and soon a State of Emergency is declared by the Mayor of Seattle. The streets are mayhem, and the WTO is paralyzed. Caught in the crossfire of civil liberties and keeping the peace are Seattle residents, including its beleaguered mayor (Ray Liotta), a riot cop on the streets (Woody Harrelson) and his pregnant wife (Charlize Theron). The choices they all make will change their lives forever.\n\nWriter/Director Stuart Townsend brings together this talented ensemble to intertwine different points of view from protesters and police to delegates and doctors -- each of whom intentionally or accidentally find themselves on the streets of Seattle in those last days of the millennium. Townsend seamlessly merges footage of the real event with his fictional narrative. Ultimately, Battle in Seattle illustrates that even against incredible odds, ordinary people can change the world."

    "Battle of Britain": "The film opens during the Battle of France in May 1940, with RAF pilots evacuating a small airfield in advance of the German Blitzkrieg. The pilots, along with British and French military, leave just as German aircraft arrive and execute a heavy strafing attack. RAF Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding (Laurence Olivier), realizing that an imminent invasion of Great Britain will require every available aircraft and airman to counter it, stops additional aircraft being deployed to France so that they are available to defend Britain.\n\nThe camera looks over of the deserted beaches of Dunkirk while the BBC relays British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's declaration that \"what General Weygand called the battle of France is over, the Battle of Britain is about to begin\". Albert Kesselring arrives to inspect a large German airfield in captured France. Hundreds of Heinkel bomber aircraft are stationed under his command.\n\nLuftwaffe commanders are stunned when the Fuhrer informs them that the British are not their \"natural enemy\" and delays their attack while attempting a diplomatic settlement. In neutral Switzerland, the German ambassador (Curt J\u00fcrgens) officially proposes new peace terms to his British counterpart (Ralph Richardson), stating that continuing to fight the \"masters\" of Europe is hopeless. The Briton replies that his country will fight on. In England, commanders celebrate their good fortune, using the delay to build up their strength and continually train their pilots and ground controllers.\n\nThe wait finally ends when Luftwaffe pilots receive orders to move to the front, where troops are preparing for a sea-borne invasion. The campaign begins with the Luftwaffe launching an early morning assault on \"Eagle Day\". The plan is to destroy the RAF on the ground before they have time to launch their Spitfire and Hurricane fighters. The Luftwaffe is aware of the British radar installations, and plan to attack them with their Stuka dive bombers. The fighter pilots question this, wondering if it is better if the British are warned by radar and come up to fight, where they can be shot down.\n\nEagle Day proves highly successful, knocking two radar stations out of action and heavily bombing a number of the British airfields. British losses are relatively light, but the RAF is in the process of building its strength, and many of the pilots who lack combat experience are shot down. The airfields are heavily damaged, with many aircraft destroyed on the ground, and their ability to repair and rearm seriously affected.\n\nAdding to the RAF's problems is a battle between the commanding officers of 11 Group, Keith Park (Trevor Howard), and 12 Group, Trafford Leigh-Mallory (Patrick Wymark). 12 Group is tasked with protecting 11 Group's airfields while 11 Group meets the enemy, but in raid after raid 12 Group aircraft are nowhere to be seen. Called to meet Dowding, Leigh-Mallory explains that the \"Big Wing\" tactic takes time for form up, while Park complains that the tactic simply isn't working. Dowding ends the debate by pointing out it makes little difference; the problem is not the tactics but a critical shortage of pilots. Dowding wearily remarks, \"We're fighting for survival, and losing\".\n\nThe turning point occurs when a squadron of German bombers becomes lost in bad weather at night and drops bombs on London. In retaliation, the RAF launches an attack on Berlin. Though the damage is negligible, Adolf Hitler is enraged, and publicly orders London to be razed. Hermann Goring (Hein Riess) arrives in France to personally lead the attack, confident that the end of the battle nears. Their first attack skirts the RAF, who are still defending their airfields to the south, and they bomb unopposed. Nighttime attacks follow, and London burns.\n\nMeanwhile, to supplement Commonwealth forces, the RAF has been forming units of foreign pilots who have escaped German-occupied countries; the main difficulty is their lack of English-language skills. While on a training flight, a Free Polish squadron accidentally runs into a flight of German bombers without escort. Ignoring the commands of their British training officer, they peel off one by one and shoot down several of the bombers. Park rewards them by elevating them to operational status, leading Dowding to do the same for the Canadian and Czech squadrons as well.\n\nWhile discussing the day's events, Park and Dowding examine the German switch to London. Given a respite, Park notes that he will be able repair his airfields and bring his squadrons back to full strength. Dowding adds that 12 Group units north of London are now all within range, while enemy fighters are at the extreme edge of their own range. He concludes that \"turning on London could be the German's biggest blunder.\"\n\nThe next German daytime raid is met by a massive response; watching his formations build up in 11 Group's operations room, Wing Commander Willoughby (Robert Flemyng) wryly states \"this should give them something to think about.\" RAF fighters are arranged into large groups and attack with all force, overwhelming the Germans and breaking up their raid. Goring is incensed, ordering his fighters remain with the bombers, an order the pilots hate. Losses continue to mount on both sides.\n\nThe climactic air battle of 15 September 1940 arrives, with Winston Churchill in attendance at 11 Group's operations room. In the underground bunker, British ground control personnel order every squadron into the air to meet the massive attack. Intense combat over the London sky follows, with both sides taking heavy losses. The outcome is so confused that Dowding refuses to pass comment on the events.\n\nThe next day the RAF anxiously await a raid that never comes. Two German anti-aircraft gunners, who had earlier protected a French port teeming with Kriegsmarine vessels and landing barges, now observe a deserted harbor basin. Goring leaves the front, accusing his commanders of betrayal. As the campaign draws to a close, the words of Winston Churchill appear onscreen: \"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few."

    "Battle: Los Angeles": "On August 12, 2011, a number of apparent meteors land in the world's oceans, near 20 major coastal cities. The objects prove to be spacecraft containing hostile extraterrestrials. San Diego and San Francisco are already lost, and LA has the last military force on the west coast. As Los Angeles (LA) is being evacuated, Marines from Camp Pendleton arrive, including United States Marine Corps Staff Sergeant Michael Nantz (Aaron Eckhart), an Iraq War veteran. Nantz, who was to begin his retirement, is assigned to 1st Platoon, Echo Company, of the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines. Nantz is not liked by his men due to some snafu in his last tour to Iraq, where many of his men failed to get back to base and were killed. The word spread that it was Nantz's fault.\n\nUnder the command of United States Marine Corps 2nd Lieutenant William Martinez (Ramon Rodriguez) (who is just out of military college with no real field experience), 1st Platoon, the platoon arrives at a forward operating base (FOB) established at Santa Monica Airport. The alien ground forces have no apparent air support, so the Air Force prepares to carpet bomb the Santa Monica area, and the platoon is given three hours to retrieve civilians from an LAPD station in West LA (the civilians got stuck at the police station when the aliens over ran their area).\n\nAs they advance through LA, they are ambushed and suffer multiple casualties. The platoon is able to survive only when Nantz breaks a fence to find an exit into a house, where they secure the perimeter and establish a safe zone. Nantz takes Marines Corporal Lee \"Cowboy\" Imlay (Will Rothhaar) and Corporal Kevin J. \"Specks\" Harris (Ne-Yo) to look for Private First Class Shaun \"Casper\" Lenihan (Noel Fisher), who is missing from the group. Lenihan is rescued after he manages to kill an alien, but only after hitting it a hundred times and dropping a grenade on it. After fighting off an alien, they team up with some soldiers from the 40th Infantry Division and an Air Force intelligence Technical Sergeant, Elena Santos (Michelle Rodriguez). Elena and her unit were tracking enemy transmissions in the area, when they were ambushed with pin point accuracy.\n\nAt the police station, the makeshift platoon finds five civilians: veterinarian Michele (Bridget Moynahan), children Kirsten (Joey King), Amy (Jadin Gould) and Hector (Bryce Cass), and Hector's father Joe (Michael Pe\u00f1a). A helicopter arrives to evacuate wounded Marines but can not take on the weight of the civilians. During takeoff, it is destroyed by alien air units (which were a new addition to the battlefield), killing Corporal Scott Grayston (Lucas Till), Corporal Richard \"Motown\" Guerrero (Neil Brown Jr.), Lenihan and Lance Corporal Corey Simmons (Taylor Handley) The unit finds a dead alien and brings it in. Michele helps them figure out their basic anatomy and its weak spots, where it can be killed.\n\nThe Marines commandeer an abandoned transit bus for the evacuation. En route, they deduce that the alien air units are drones that target human radio transmissions. Santos reveals that her mission is to locate the aliens' command and control center, as its destruction should deactivate the drones. When their bus comes under attack on an elevated freeway (Nantz figures out that the aliens are tracking their radio signals), the Marines rappel the group to street level. In the ensuing battle, Marines Lance Corporal Nick C. \"Stavs\" Stavrou (Gino Anthony Pesi) and Lance Corporal Steven \"Motorolla\" Mottola (James Hiroyuki Liao) and the remainder of the Army National Guard soldiers are killed, while both Joe and Lieutenant Martinez are wounded fighting the aliens.\n\nMartinez uses his radio to attract the aliens, then detonates explosives, sacrificing himself. Nantz is now in command of surviving personnel Santos, Imlay, Lance Corporal Peter J. \"Irish\" Kerns (Jim Parrack), Corporal Jason \"Cochise\" Lockett (Cory Hardrict), Harris, Navy Hospital Corpsman Second Class Jibril A. \"Doc\" Adukwu (Adetokumboh M'Cormack) and the civilians, continuing their escape from the bombing zone. A news report interviews a scientist who speculates that the aliens are seeking Earth's water for fuel while eradicating the human population.\n\nThe carpet bombing never happens. Reaching the FOB, the Marines find it destroyed and that the military is retreating from LA. The Marines plan to escort the civilians to an alternate extraction point. When Joe dies from his wounds, Nantz comforts Hector. Lockett confronts Nantz regarding his brother, a Marine who, with four others, was killed during Nantz's last tour. They come to peace when Nantz explains that he continues to think of them, and recites each person's name, rank and serial number. Nantz motivates the group to move forward to honor their fallen comrades, including Joe for his bravery. They reach the extraction point and evacuate by helicopter.\n\nIn flight, the chopper experiences a brief loss of power. Nantz theorizes that they are flying near the alien command center, transmitting intense radio messages to its drones (which knocks out nearby power sources). He orders his unit to accompany the civilians while he stays to reconnoiter the area, but his fighters all join him. Searching through sewers, they confirm the presence of a large alien vessel. Kerns radios in to request missiles, which Nantz manually directs using a laser designating device while the others defend his position. Kerns is killed when a drone homes in on his radio, but the Marines succeed in routing a missile to the command module, which is destroyed. The uncontrolled drones fall from the sky, and the alien ground forces retreat.\n\nThe remaining fighters-Nantz, Imlay, Lockett, Harris, Adukwu and Santos-are evacuated to a base in the Mojave Desert, where they are greeted as heroes. They are told that their successful method has been transmitted to the armies battling alien forces in 19 other cities, that Michele and the three children were rescued, and that they can now rest. Instead, they re-arm and join the armed force leaving to retake Los Angeles."

    "Battlefield Earth": "In the year 3000, Earth has been ruled for 1,000 years by the Psychlos, a brutal race of giant humanoid aliens. The remnants of humanity are either enslaved by the Psychlos and used for manual labor or survive in primitive tribes living in remote areas outside Psychlo control. Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper), a member of one such tribe, leaves his home in the Rocky Mountains on a journey of exploration. He joins forces with Carlo (Kim Coates), a hunter, but both men are captured by a Psychlo raiding party and transported to a slave camp at the Psychlos' main base on Earth, a giant dome built over the ruins of Denver, Colorado. Terl (John Travolta), the Psychlo security chief on Earth, has been condemned by his superiors to remain indefinitely at his post on Earth as punishment for an unclear incident involving \"the Senator's daughter.\" Aided by his deputy, Ker (Forest Whitaker), Terl devises a plan to buy his way off the planet by making a fortune using human slaves to mine gold in radioactive areas. Psychlos are unable to visit such areas due to the explosive interaction of the gas that they breathe with radionuclide particles. Terl selects Jonnie as his \"foreman\" for the project and gives him a Psychlo education using a rapid-learning machine. Terl gives Jonnie a party of slaves and a Psychlo flying shuttle and orders him to go out and find gold. After learning the Psychlos' language, history, and myriad other educational forms from the rapid learning machine, Jonnie plots a human uprising against the Psychlos. He obtains gold from Fort Knox to satisfy Terl's demands, instead of mining gold as ordered. Jonnie and his followers find an abandoned underground US military base with working aircraft, weapons, fuel, and nuclear weapons. They use the base's flight simulators to train themselves in aerial combat. After a week of training, the rebels launch a mass uprising against the Psychlos using Harrier jump-jets and other weapons. Carlo sacrifices himself to destroy the dome over Denver, and the Psychlos inside suffocate in Earth's atmosphere, which they are unable to breathe. Jonnie captures a Psychlo teleportation device and uses it to teleport an atomic bomb to the Psychlo home world. The ensuing detonation causes the entire Psychlo atmosphere to explode, wiping out the planet. Ker and Terl survive on Earth but face different fates: Ker sides with the victorious humans, while Terl is imprisoned as a hostage within a vault in Fort Knox. The film ends with the humans in control of Earth but facing an uncertain future."

    "Battleground": "Battleground is one of the first World War Two films that showed the US Infantry war in Europe through the lens of reality, and one of the first to have the cast include Veterans of the very battle this story portrays. The story involves the men of 2nd Squad, 3rd Platoon, Company I, 3rd Battalion, 327th Glider Infantry Regiment, which was under the Leadership of Staff Sergeant Kinne (James Whitmore).\n\nAs the movie opens, on December 17, 1944, the 101st Airborne Division has returned to France for Training and R&R on November 25, 1944 after completing their share of the assault on Nijmegen-Arnhem in Holland on September 17, 1944. Two new Riflemen have arrived, fresh from a Replacement Depot, Privates Jim Layton (Marshall Thompson), and William J. Hooper (Scotty Beckett). Hooper is assigned to Company K, while Layton is assigned to Company I. Layton is further assigned to 2nd Squad, 3rd Platoon, apparently expected to replace PFC Holley who is in a Field Hospital at the time, convalescing from a wound he received in Holland. Thus it is that Private Layton is introduced to his Squad, and goes through a pecking order as he figures out which cot in the Squad Tent is his, only to be out-ranked by the returning Private First Class Holley (Van Johnson) who reclaims his cot, leaving Layton as an extra man in the Squads Table of Organization. Not much is done to settle the situation at the time because the Squad which has a 3-Day Pass for Paris figures rearrangement can wait for their return, although Layton is expected to remain in camp over the three days.\n\nStaff Sergeant Kinne wakes the Squad early the next morning, informing the men that the pass is cancelled because they have to return to the frontline because of an emergency. They are told that the Germans have broken through the lines, and the 101st is needed to help plug the breach. We see 3rd Platoon boarding Deuce and a Half Trucks, and they meet their Replacement Platoon Leader, 2LT Teiss (Brett King), as they do. With the trucks loaded, 3rd Platoon pulls out and heads East, following the rest of the 101st, the troops still not knowing exactly where they are heading. The convoy ends at Bastogne, where the troops are Bivouacked at local homes for the night. 3rd Platoon draws Guard Duty, and so is at the eastern end of Bastogne when a retreating Infantry Company passes west through their lines, telling of their experience with the advancing German 47th Corps. This is when 2nd Squad learns of the seriousness of the engagement they are about to enter.\n\nThe next day, the 101st continues their advancement east, deploying around Bastogne to secure their positions. This is when they experience their first action in the Battle of the Bulge, being fired upon by German machine guns that are behind cover. Once the firing stops, the Squads are deployed to clear a heavily forested area, and to set up their line, including Fox Holes and Strong Points. Just as they finish, they are moved out to another location, where they have to repeat their earlier exercise. 2nd Squad draws Guard Duty overnight, with PFC Holley, PVT Layton and PVT Kipton (Douglas Fowley) manning the eastward road block. They are told to be extra watchful for Germans in American uniforms and speaking American English. As the three men man the road block, they are approached from the east by a squad led by a 2nd Lieutenant who correctly answer the daily challenge and password. The three men let them continue on, but Van Johnson has some suspicions of the Lieutenant since he is wearing his bars while on patrol.\n\nOn the next day, the snow starts, and the action starts to heat up. The Three men find out that the patrol from the previous night were indeed German infiltrators they blew a bridge and as a result the 327th sends out more patrols to scout for more German infiltrators. This time Laytons visit to K Company pay dividends because the team runs into a squad led by another 2nd Lieutenant who claims to be from K Company. Layton acts like he is not suspicious, and turns his team around towards their camp, and they try to run from the infiltrators. They run into a German machinegun team, which they destroy with a hand grenade, and then they return to their camp to report the contact. Their report results in artillery fire being dropped on the location where the German infiltrators bringing success.\n\nThe Bad weather continues, with chance encounters taking place between the Germans and the Americans, adding to the casualties. Finally, the famous Nuts incident takes place, with the Germans coming to the 3rd Platoons lines. They are blind folded and taken to the Division Headquarters, where MG Mc Auliffe answers their demand for the American surrender. The Germans return via the 3rd Platoons area, and we get to see their reaction to McAuliffes answer.\n\nOn Christmas Day, a Chaplain (Leon Ames) holds a service in the field, using his Jeep as the Altar. He is interrupted by incoming artillery, so he ends with silent prayer.\n\nThe German Artillery Barrage continues, until when the fog lifts the Tactical Air Command can come over and knock out the German Artillery and Tanks, and the Cargo planes can drop supplies to the 101st. This leads to the lifting of the Seige, and the capturing of the surviving Germans.\n\nWith the lift of the siege, the 101st Airborne Division is relived, by the 4th Armored Division, and SSG Kinne is ordered to return the 3rd Platoon to France to prepare for further action. He has them fall in and march to cadence and Jodie calls. The movie ends with them marching Westward past advancing troops."

    "Battlestar Galactica: Razor": "Battlestar Galactica: Razor (2007) tells the story of the first mission of Lee 'Apollo' Adama (Jamie Bamber) as commander of the battlestar Pegasus. Flashbacks interleaved with the main story show what happened to Pegasus during and after the Cylon attack on the Twelve Colonies, as well as some events at the end of the First Cylon War. The main story and most of the flashbacks focus on Lt. Kendra Shaw (Stephany Jacobsen), who joins Pegasus as aide to Adm. Helena Cain (Michelle Forbes) just before the Cylons strike.\n\nWe first see Shaw in the main storyline, working in the galley and using drugs; she's out of uniform and looks like a grunt, so it's a surprise to hear Apollo address her as 'Lieutenant.' Calling her Cain's legacy, Apollo makes Shaw his executive officer, with a promotion to major. This is a risky move given the black marks in Shaw's record resulting from run-ins with Cain's immediate successors, Fisk (Graham Beckel) and Garner (John Heard). Shaw tells Apollo that Fisk and Garner were unworthy of her respect and shows little respect for Apollo himself, sneering that he hasn't earned his command--his daddy just gave him the keys to the battlestar.\n\nIn flashback, Shaw experiences Cain's brutality at first hand, initially in small ways: Cain belittles her for having trouble finding her way to the battlestar's CIC (bridge), accuses her of having her influential mother pull strings to get this new assignment, and when Shaw replies that her mother has died, warns Shaw never again to play for sympathy. Shaw gets a first glimmer of respect from Cain by staying at her post in the CIC for two solid days after the Cylon attack--though the admiral can't refrain from making her exhausted subordinate button her jacket.\n\nSoon after the attack, Shaw meets and befriends Gina Inviere (Tricia Helfer), a civilian systems specialist who is on board to help refit the Pegasus computer networks. Shaw is surprised to learn that Gina is romantically involved with Cain; as she remarks to Gina, Cain seems entirely self-sufficient. Gina replies that everyone has needs--\"we're all human.\" This line is aimed at viewers familiar with the Battlestar Galactica (2004) television series, who will recognize Gina as a Cylon model Six.\n\nPegasus attacks what at first seems to be a small group of Cylon ships guarding a communications relay; when it turns out to be a huge force, the officers' instinct is to back off. Cain orders an all-out assault that may prove suicidal and her executive officer Belzen (Steve Bacic)--who is the closest thing she has to a friend among her officers--refuses; Cain kills him with his own sidearm and appoints Col. Fisk as XO in his place. (In the season 2 episode 'Pegasus,' Fisk tells this story to Col. Tigh.)\n\nSome Cylons manage to board Pegasus and Cain sends Shaw after them. Shaw meets Gina and sends her to the CIC, where she'll be safe. Shortly thereafter she sees a Cylon Centurion, followed by a Number Six, which Shaw kills. Realizing that Gina must be a human-form Cylon, Shaw races back to the CIC in time to arrest her before she can take over the ship. Cain locks Gina--her erstwhile lover--in the brig and assigns Lt. Thorne (Fulvio Cecere) to interrogate her. She instructs him to use pain, humiliation, and fear to extract information. Shaw is promoted to captain for her role in exposing and capturing Gina, though she confesses that she unwittingly helped the Cylons by giving Gina access codes. Cain is surprisingly forgiving, presumably because Gina had won Cain's trust as well.\n\nPegasus encounters a small convoy of civilian ships led by the Scylla. Cain sends officers and marines to each of the ships carrying demands that vital personnel and equipment--including faster-than-light (FTL) drives--be transferred to Pegasus. Without its FTL drives, the convoy will be dead in the water, unable to reach any refuge or flee any attack. Fisk, Shaw, and their detachment of marines are sent to the Scylla, whose crew and passengers object vehemently to Cain's demands. When Fisk communicates their objections to Cain, she tells him to shoot the family of anyone on the conscription list who refuses to cooperate. This leads to even greater agitation aboard Scylla; seeing that the passengers are on the verge of violence, Shaw opens fire on the crowd and kills a woman. The marines kill nine others before the passengers are subdued. Having stripped the convoy, Pegasus abandons it to pursue the Cylons.\n\nAdditional flashbacks show events at the very end of the First Cylon War, forty-odd years before the events of the main story. In one flashback, Helena Cain is a child (Kyra Scott) whose home is under attack by the Cylons. Her father, injured, tells her to take her younger sister Lucy (Chandra Berg) and run. The girls don't get far before Lucy becomes trapped in some rubble. Unable to free her, Helena flees from the oncoming Cylon Centurions; from her hiding-place, she listens as Lucy's cries are cut off. A Centurion finds Helena but apparently receives the order to cease fire before it can kill her. It's here that Helena picks up the wooden-handled pocket knife the film uses to illustrate the razor metaphor.\n\nIn the other flashback to the First Cylon War, William 'Husker' Adama is a young Viper pilot (Nico Cortez). He ejects from his damaged Viper over a planet and discovers that the Cylons have been conducting horrific experiments on human captives. He encounters the first Cylon Hybrid (Campbell Lane). Adama tries to free the remaining captives but is forced to abandon them when an earthquake threatens to bring the building down on him. When he gets out, he sees a basestar flying away and learns that the war is over.\n\nFrom these similar experiences, Cain and Adama draw different lessons on how the military should deal with civilians in time of war. Cain apparently views her own survival to fight another day as a worthy return for Lucy's sacrifice; she attempts to banish human feeling and make herself simply a tool--like a razor, she says, fiddling with her pocket knife--but a tool of war. When Cain tells Shaw that sometimes you have to leave people behind in war, Shaw is remembering the civilians of the Scylla and its raped convoy, but Cain must be thinking of Lucy.\n\nAdama's lesson is about protecting civilians rather than bringing destruction to the enemy at all costs. He notes that his conclusion, which he discusses with Apollo, was influenced by Col. Tigh (Michael Hogan), by the advocacy of President Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell) for her people, and even more by Adama's need to be able to look his son in the eye. Even so, he won't condemn Cain's actions, even in the case of the the Scylla's convoy.\n\nIn the present, Adm. Adama sends Apollo and Pegasus to retrieve a missing scientific expedition. Pegasus is attacked by Cylon Raiders, one of which follows a Viper piloted by Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) into the landing bay before being disabled. (Starbuck is angry with Shaw for putting her at risk by ordering Pegasus's batteries to fire at the Raiders while Starbuck and another Viper were engaged with them, but Shaw rejects the criticism on the grounds that her priority was to protect Pegasus.) The captured Raider and its Centurions prove to be of an old design from the time of the First Cylon War, which is puzzling. Sharon Valerii (Grace Park) remembers a story about a group of old-model Centurions who guard the first Hybrid; Adama realizes that this is the same group of Cylons he discovered at the end of the last war, and they may be using the missing science team for the same kind of experiments. He transfers his flag to Pegasus so he can oversee the search and rescue mission, though Apollo remains in command of the ship.\n\nUsing data from the captured Raider, the science team is traced to a Cylon basestar. Shaw devises a plan to get a rescue team--Shaw herself, Starbuck, and three others--into the basestar while Pegasus draws the Cylons' fire. The rescue team's Raptor is attacked by Raiders, as they expected it would be, so they abandon it, completing their journey to the basestar using jet packs. They find the science team, who aren't in very good shape; as Adama feared, the Cylons have mutilated them. Then things start to go bad: they're attacked by Centurions, who damage the detonation timer on the team's nuke (with which they intend to destroy the basestar after they leave). The Centurions also capture Dasilva (Andrew Dunbar), one of the team's marines. Shaw, realizing that Dasilva will probably be mutilated as the science team was, shoots and kills him as the Centurions drag him away.\n\nAt this point the rescue team loses contact with Pegasus. Apollo, fearing that they have been captured, orders a nuclear strike against the basestar, but his father countermands the order. When contact is regained, Apollo tells the team that another Raptor is on the way to pick them up, but someone has to stay behind to detonate the nuke and destroy the basestar. He orders Starbuck to do it, but Shaw, who has been wounded, forces Starbuck into the Raptor at gunpoint and takes the nuke back into the basestar herself.\n\nShaw makes her way to the first Hybrid, whose voice has been audible--speaking more coherently than the later-model Hybrid familiar to viewers of season 3--on several occasions during the rescue. The Hybrid makes some oracular pronouncements about the final five Cylons and repeats a line, apparently from scripture, that it quoted to young William Adama 40 years before: \"All of this has happened before and will happen again.\" It calls Shaw by name and tells her to approach if she wants to be forgiven. The Hybrid warns Shaw that Kara Thrace will lead the human race to its destruction and they must not follow her. Shaw is unable to pass this information back to Pegasus because the Cylons are jamming her communications. She sets off the bomb, destroying herself, the Hybrid, and the basestar.\n\nIn the aftermath, Apollo and Adm. Adama discuss Starbuck's suggestion of a posthumous commendation for Shaw. In light of the Scylla incident Apollo doubts that she deserves it, but no decision is reached. Adama mentions that he's been reviewing Cain's logs and can't find much fault with her actions. He notes that history will judge them all, but the first draft of history will appear in their own logs; they adjourn to work on them. Apollo runs into Starbuck in the corridor and she tells him she's resigning as CAG to return to Galactica, joking that he's apparently trying to get her killed and she has a destiny to fulfill."

    "Baywatch": "In Emerald Bay, Florida, Lt. Mitch Buchannon (Dwayne Johnson) and his team of lifeguards, including second-in-command Stephanie Holden (Ilfenesh Hadera) and veteran C.J. Parker (Kelly Rohrbach), protect the beaches and the bay as part of an elite division known as Baywatch. Having made over 500 rescues in his career, Mitch is beloved by the community, to the annoyance of local beat cop Garner Ellerbee (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and Mitch's superior, Captain Thorpe (Rob Huebel). During one of his morning patrols, Mitch discovers a small pouch of drugs washed up near the Huntley Club, which is now under the ownership of businesswoman Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra).\n\nAt the upcoming tryouts for new lifeguards, three people stand out: surfer Summer Quinn (Alexandra Daddario), an old friend of Holden's, Ronnie (Jon Bass), a chubby nerd with a crush on C.J. (that is gradually returned), and Matt Brody (Zac Efron), a former Olympic swimmer who fell from grace after vomiting during a race and now has to perform community service as part of an unspecified plea deal. Quinn and Ronnie both pass the trials, but Brody refuses to do so and insists that his celebrity status alone entitles him to a place on the team. Despite Brody demonstrating his abilities by assisting in the rescue of a drowning woman and her son, Mitch complains to Thorpe that he is unfit. Thorpe, in turn, insists that rehabilitating his image is necessary to convince the city not to further cut Baywatch's funding.\n\nAs Brody begins his training under Mitch, it becomes clear that he is developing a crush on Quinn. The team is called into action when a private yacht catches fire, during which Brody disobeys orders and dives directly under the flames, causing him to nearly drown before Holden and C.J. save him. Most of the boat's occupants are saved, with the exception of a deceased man identified as a city official. When Mitch tries to investigate his body, Ellerbee shows up and informs him that he is not a cop and has no business trying to solve a crime. Brody makes it clear that he agrees, which causes a rift between him and the other lifeguards who support Mitch.\n\nAt a party held by Leeds, Brody botches his role as lookout by getting drunk; Mitch retaliates by humiliating him in front of the crowd. Brody, who is effectively broke and homeless because of his poor life choices, goes to him the next morning and begs for a second chance. Mitch agrees and takes him and Quinn to infiltrate the city morgue, where they record two of Leeds' men planting a falsified autopsy report to cover up the fact that the councilman was murdered on her orders. Unfortunately, they are discovered, and though Mitch manages to subdue and capture one of them, the recording is destroyed and Ellerbee is forced to release their suspect on a lack of evidence. Angered, Thorpe threatens to fire Mitch if he oversteps his authority again.\n\nConvinced that Leeds is running drugs out of the Huntley, Mitch and Brody go undercover and sneak into the club kitchen, where they witness her workers retrieving the drugs from barrels of fish and processing them. They contact Ellerbee, only to learn that another body has been found on the beach. Thorpe, enraged that Mitch essentially deserted his post, fires him and names Brody as the new lieutenant. Brody accepts the job reluctantly, and Mitch takes a job as a cellphone salesman.\n\nAfter finding another pouch of drugs on the beach, Brody steals the second victim's report from Ellerbee and brings it to Quinn, who confirms his suspicion that the man was murdered. Ronnie, upon recognizing the victim as his friend Dave (Hannibal Buress), helps Brody hack into Leeds' servers, revealing her plan to privatize the entire beach by systematically buying out or eliminating every competing business owner. The team infiltrates a private party on Leeds' personal yacht, discovering how she's been using the hull to smuggle the drugs. Brody is captured and placed in a bait cage to be drowned, and a gloating Leeds reveals that she bribed the corrupt Thorpe to set Mitch up so he could justify firing him before pushing the cage into the water. Just before Brody drowns, Mitch appears and saves him.\n\nThe two catch up to Leeds, while Ronnie and C.J. use fireworks to prevent her escape helicopter from landing. Just as they run out, a wounded Mitch, having intentionally stung himself with a sea urchin to boost his adrenaline, uses a Roman candle to blow Leeds up, saving Brody once again. Ellerbee arrives and takes Thorpe into custody, apologizing to Mitch for doubting him. In the aftermath, Ronnie and Brody begin relationships with C.J. and Quinn respectively. Mitch formally inducts Quinn, Ronnie, and Brody into Baywatch and introduces them to their new captain."

    "Beast": "Poachers have just killed a pride of lions, but one escaped. The Lion turns into a rogue man-eater and starts attacking the poachers.\n\nRecently widowed Dr. Nate Samuels (Idris Elba) and his daughters, Meredith (Iyana Halley) and Norah (Leah Sava Jeffries), arrive at the Mopani Reserve in South Africa for a vacation. Nate reunites with his old friend, Martin Battles (Sharlto Copley), a biologist and Mopani manager, who introduced Nate and his wife Amalhe (Naledi Mogadime). Martin takes Nate and the girls to the village where Nate's wife grew up. Nate confides to Martin his guilt over being distant following his and his wife's separation, after which she developed terminal cancer. Meredith blames Nate for abandoning them when their mother was going through cancer. The trip is to reconnect with his daughters.\n\nThe next day, Martin and the family tour the reserve's restricted areas. Martin shows them a local lion pride and notices that one is injured. This is a pride that Martin has raised since they were cubs. At a nearby Tsonga community, Martin discovers most of the population is dead. Suspecting a rogue, man-killing lion is responsible, Martin rushes back to the nearest rangers station to report the finding. Nate & Martin encounter an injured Tsonga man on the road but are unable to save him. Martin is mauled as he tracks the lion with his gun. It then ambushes Nate, who takes cover in the car. Meredith speeds the car away but crashes into a tree, stranding them.\n\nMartin radios Nate on a Walkie-talkie, warning him to stay away, saying the lion is using Martin as bait to lure the others out. As the radio is out of range to contact help, Nate assembles a tranquilizer rifle. He confronts the lion, hoping to subdue it long enough to recover Martin and trek back to civilization. The lion attacks, and Meredith takes advantage of the distraction to save Martin. Nate is knocked off the top of the car and takes refuge under the car. As the lion attacks Nate by trying to get under the car, Norah stabs the lion with a tranquilizer dart from inside the car, after it knocks the gun from Nate's hands. This causes the lion to retreat. Meredith brings Martin back to the car, and Nate treats his wound.\n\nAs night falls, the now-recovering Martin speculates the lion went rogue after poachers killed its pride. Soon after, the poachers arrive and initially agree to transport the group to the village in exchange for payment. Tensions rise after the poachers spot Martin, an avid anti-poacher, inside the car. The lion attacks and scatters the poachers, killing most of them. Nate maneuvers his way past the lion and finds the poachers' truck keys. Back at the car, Martin holds the lion off long enough to allow the sisters to escape, though Meredith sustains a deep laceration to her side. The car falls into a ravine and Martin sacrifices himself by setting off an explosion from the leaking gasoline, severely burning the lion. Nate starts the truck and races away with Meredith and Norah but has to stop the car before they run out of fuel. They leave the car and walk to an abandoned schoolhouse nearby. On the way they had passed the pride of lions that Martin had raised from cubs.\n\nAt the abandoned schoolhouse, which the poachers used as their base, Nate treats Meredith's wound and forages for water. The lion appears and stalks the girls, but Nate returns and scares it off. Locking his daughters inside a room, Nate promises to return after subduing the lion. After provoking the lion into chasing him, Nate lures it to the local lion pride which Martin helped raise. The rogue lion overtakes and mauls Nate, nearly killing him, until the pride males intervene and kill the rogue. A Mopani worker arrives and saves Nate as he falls unconscious.\n\nAwakening in a hospital, a recovering Nate tells his daughters he loves them. Sometime later, the three return to the preserve, this time as a united family, and recreate the photo Nate's late wife took of herself next to her favorite tree."

    "Beast": "Veera Raghavan, an Indian RAW field agent is assigned to capture a terrorist named Umar Farooq. While he successfully manages to do so, a missile shot by him to prevent Farooq's escape injures and kills a civilian child, traumatising Veera, who quits the agency and returns to Chennai. 11 months later, Veera is still relieving from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He meets Preethi at a wedding, and they fall for each other, where she convinces him to join her company Dominic & Soldiers, a failing security service. Meanwhile, the Tamil Nadu government gets intel that a major terrorist event is planned in Chennai.\n\nAlong with Preethi and her boss Dominic Irudhayaraj, Veera visits the East Coast mall, which is their last client where he observes a series of suspicious activities and deduces that someone else has taken over the mall. Veera is proven right, as terrorists, led by Umar Farooq's brother Umar Saif, open fire and hijack the mall. Veera, Preethi, Dominic and others hide unharmed inside an unopened restaurant. The government, led by Deputy National Security Advisor Althaf Hussain, tries to negotiate with the terrorists, who demands the release of Farooq. Althaf learns that Veera is also trapped inside the mall and manages to establish contact with him, where he tries to convince Veera to help them.\n\nThough initially hesitant, Veera gets convinced when he realises that the terrorists are here for Farooq, where he kills one of the terrorists and captures another one alive and brings him to their hideout. Veera manages to infiltrate the terrorists and eliminates a few of them. The Home Minister, who is in league with Saif, gets them to stage the execution of his wife and daughter Aparna, who are also in the mall on live television. The government succumbs to this and agrees to release Farooq. Enraged, Veera retaliates and kidnaps the Home Minister's wife and Aparna where he pretends to be a Bangladeshi militant to confuse the terrorists, and threatens to kill them if Farooq is released.\n\nSenses his impending defeat, Saif seemingly gives up, only to slip among the crowd pretending to be a hostage, and soon figures out Veera's real identity due to Dominic where he forces him and his aides to give up and captures all of them. With the help of Aparna, Veera manages to escape, and eliminates Saif and the other terrorists while making sure that the hostages escape to safety. The Home Minister is arrested for his involvement in the hijack. Despite all the negotiations, Farooq is released. Few months later, Veera captures Farooq in Pakistan and after surviving a long air chase, manages to bring him back to India to have him imprisoned. After the mission, Veera, Preethi, Dominic and the rest of his crew celebrate their escapades in Goa."

    "Beastmaster 2: Through the Portal of Time": "In the land of Arok, the nomad warrior Dar (Marc Singer), known as the Beastmaster for his magical ability to control animals, is taken prisoner by the evil warlord, Arklon (Wings Hauser). Dar refuses to divulge the location of rebel forces and is sentenced to death. The executioner is interrupted by Dar's pet tiger, Ruh, while his ferrets, Podo and Kodo, chew through their master's bonds, allowing him to defeat Arklon's soldiers. When the warlord fights back with a magical laser device called the \"Key of Magog,\" Dar's eagle, Sharak, tears at Arklon's face, enabling the Beastmaster to escape.\n\nSometime later, rebel forces are led into a narrow gorge by a treasonous witch named Lyranna (Sarah Douglas). After Arklon's army annihilates the rebels, Lyranna offers to make him the most powerful man on planet Earth. Lyranna speaks in modern English slang which confuses Arklon and she tells him that she has been to a place where others imagine beyond space and time.\n\nMeanwhile, Dar encounters a deformed swamp creature who identifies herself as the sister of his late father, King Zed. She explains her appearance as the result of practicing \"forbidden rituals,\" and informs Dar that he has a brother, who was raised by evil high priests. The creature predicts the end of the world at his brother's hands, unless Dar kills him before the autumn equinox.\n\nAt Arklon's fortress, Lyranna reveals a portal leading to the modern day city of Los Angeles, California, which exists in a parallel dimension. In nearby Long Beach, California, is the Strategic Research and Development Center, which houses the \"neutron detonator\", a weapon so terrible that its possessor could control the world. Arklon reluctantly agrees to Lyranna's offer to secure the detonator in exchange for becoming his queen.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Jackie Trent (Kari Wuhrer), the spoiled teenage daughter of United States Senator Herbert Trent, drives recklessly through the streets with two police cars in pursuit. Attempting to evade the officers, Jackie enters an alley, and all three cars pass through the portal to Arklon's fortress. Soldiers surround the two policemen, who assume they have stumbled into a science fiction convention. When the soldiers set fire to the police cars, the officers jump back through the portal and escape, while Jackie speeds away from the fortress. Hours later, her car runs out of fuel and she searches the wilderness for a gasoline station in the vast desert. After camping for the night, she is awakened by Dar and his animals. Jackie assumes Dar is a circus performer and joins him on his quest, hoping he can lead her back to the city.\n\nThe next day, Arklon's soldiers kidnap Jackie and return her to the fortress. Arklon, who now hides his scarred face behind a partial leather mask, explains Jackie's presence in the parallel dimension, and promises to return her to Los Angeles if she assists him in acquiring the neutron detonator. Although Jackie knows nothing of the weapon, she falsely claims that her father can accommodate the warlord.\n\nDar makes his way to the fortress and passes through the portal in pursuit of Jackie, Arklon, and Lyranna. The warlord notices the letter \"A\" embossed in the palm of Dar's right hand, indicating they are brothers. He ruptures a gas pipe, trapping Dar behind a wall of flames while Jackie guides the two villains through the city. Dar is hospitalized after police subdue him with a Taser, and his tiger is placed in a zoo.\n\nOn the street, Jackie tells Arklon and Lyranna that their strange attire is drawing unwanted attention, and convinces them to shop for new clothes. When she flees her captors, the enraged Arklon wrecks the clothing store, and police release a composite sketch of the perpetrator.\n\nThe next day at a police station, Detectives Coberly (James Avery) and Bendowski (Robert Fieldsteel)) question Dar about wanting to know who he is and where he comes from, but Dar refuses to talk. When Dar sees the wanted police sketch of Arklon, he manages to grab his sword and escapes through a window to continue his quest. Jackie happens by and drives Dar hide out in her Beverly Hills home.\n\nMeanwhile, Arklon steals the uniform of a drunken military officer and gains access to the Strategic Research and Development Center, where he is joined by Lyranna. Dar and Jackie see the uniformed warlord on a television newscast and follow him to Long Beach.\n\nArklon and Lyranna break into the facility and steal the weapon, unaware that they have triggered its detonation timer. Using his mind reading skills, Arklon learns of Lyranna's plot to kill him and usurp his throne, so he abandons her in Long Beach and speeds back toward the portal in a stolen jeep. Jackie and Dar give chase, accompanied by Lyranna, who offers to help defeat the warlord. Upon reaching the portal, Lyranna agrees to apprise Senator Trent of the situation, motivated by her lust for powerful men.\n\nArklon evades capture and makes his way to the zoo. Dar and Jackie follow, guided by Sharak. The warlord shoots the eagle out of the sky with the Key of Magog, then creates a flaming crevice in the ground. Ruh, the tiger, breaks free from his cage and assists the ferrets in relieving Arklon of the detonator and the key.\n\nThe brothers engage in a sword-fight, which ends with Arklon falling into the flames, declaring \"The world is mine!\" While Dar attends to his wounded eagle, police escort Admiral Binns to the site, and he disarms the bomb with only a second to spare. When Dar and Jackie return to the portal, he bestows his ferrets on her and promises to return, now that he has possession of the key.\n\nBack in his own world, Dar encounters a group of pilgrims who gather to worship Jackie's abandoned car, and dance to music from its stereo system."

    "Beau Geste": "Film opens on a column of french foreign legion troops marching through the dessert. They stop to observe outpost Zinderneuf (funny, the subtitles call it 'Internet'). The officer fires a signal into the air, and a shot is returned hitting the ground in front of him. Riders as dispatched to scout the fort, and discover that dead soldiers are been propped up at the parapets. As the scout makes his report another shot is heard in the fort. They enter the fort and discover one survivor - Beau Geste - who we next see recovering in the infirmary.\n\nIn a flashback, we see the day he mustered into the Legion. At assembly, Sgt. Dagineau addresses several recruits, including Boldini, who is known to the Sergent from a prior enlistment. Dagineau reads from an unsigned letter which was found on his desk from someone who claims that he will shoot Dagineau in the back during a battle to settle a score. Dagineau suspects it is Beau, who he calls \"Graves\" initially. From the parade ground, the film cuts to Lieutenant De Ruse's office, where Dagineau and he speak about the letter. Dagineau believes it to be from an educated man who will reveal himself. The Lieutenant suggests it is unfair to punish all for the deed of one.\n\nCut to the men in their barracks. Boldini, who is a stereotypical Italian \"fast talker\", suggests that someone should confess to writing the letter to make things easier on everyone. There is tension and Boldini becomes the target of suspicion, having previously been in the legion with Dagineau. Cut to a montage of grueling training and a scene where Dagineau has four men, including Beau and Boldinin, march blindfolded toward a cliff to demonstrate obeying orders. In another training set with bayonets, the Beau succeeds in disarming Dagineau.\n\nCut to Dr Ruse's quarters, where he has summoned Beau. De Ruse reveals that he knows who Beau really is from a picture that appeared in a newspaper story about an American businessman who had disappeared after confessing to having embezzled money. We learn that several weeks later, his business partner confessed to being the person who actually embezzled the money and committed suicide, making Beau's gesture futile. He suggests that Beau adopt a new name, since \"Graves\" sounds like \"Grave\", and calls him Beau Geste.\n\nCut to the men out on pass, watching a \"belly dance\" and drinking. Boldini approaches Beau and tries to get him to reveal his \"secret\" -- whether he wrote the letter. Other troopers intervene, making it known they do not trust Boldini. In return, Boldini reveals that he knows secrets about all of them. As they return to the barracks, Boldini gets an idea to get Dagineau off their back about the letter -- choose a scapegoat who is useless, cut his throat, and then tell Dagineau he confessed. The troopers agree and seize Boldini. As they are about to impale him with a bayonet, Dagineau breaks us the fight, and afterwards in Dagineau's quarters, Boldini agrees to be Dagineau's spy and find \"Graves\" weakness. At assembly the next day, Beau volunteers to be whipped for the riot in the barracks the prior evening. Afterwords, De Ruse discusses with Boldini whether his methods are appropriate.\n\nIn the infirmary Beau's brother, Johnny is tending to the lacerations on his back. Johnny followed his brothers trail and has enlisted too. Johnny gives him a pocket watch that plays music when opened and has the picture of a girl Beau and his business partner both loved. Beau tells him not to let Sgt. Dagineau know that they know each other, but Boldini overhears and tells Dagineau that they are brothers.\n\nHalf of the regiment is ordered to Zinderneuf to relieve the current squad there. In the barracks, Dagineau addresses Johnny for the first time, hitting him in the stomach and calling him soft. The troops head out to Zinderneuf, and make fortifications in the evening. Johnny and Beau talk and Dagineau puts them on watch. A raiding party strikes, and several troopers, including De Ruse, are wounded. They arrive at Zinderneuf and De Ruse insists on mounting his horse from the stretch to accept command in a dignified manner. Thereafter he falls off his horse and is taken to the infirmary.\n\nThe men, including Johnny and Beau, dig graves outside the fort. Dagineau orders Johnny to tell him why Beau enlisted. Johnny says no one is supposed to ask about your past when you join the Legion. Dagineau beats him with a riding crop and Beau strikes down Dagineau. As punishment for striking an officer, Beau is buried up to his neck in the desert. In the evening when he is dug up, the troopers discuss mutiny in the barracks. Boldini enters first questions them and then tries to reason with them. He says Dagineau knows what they are planning. He is stabbed in the back by one of the troopers. Everyone but Beau and Johnny rush out to overpower Dagineau, but he has set up a machine gun and mows them down. Johnny and Beau drop from the wall behind his position and Dagineau is knocked down and strung up by his boots.\n\nAt this moment a tribe attacks the fort. The men untie Dagineau and rally to repel the assault. The leader of the mutiny is sent to man the watch tower. Beau speaks with De Ruse in his quarters, where De Ruse reveals that he wrote the letter because he was jealous of Dagineau and wanted to infect him with fear but it backfired and made him stronger and harder on the men. De Ruse then dies.\n\nThe Arabs make another assault on the fort and are repelled at great loss of life. After they retreat, another mutineer is ordered up to the tower. At night Beau and Johnny discuss their plans of having a Viking funeral. In the morning, the Arabs assault the fort again with incendiary missiles. They retreat unexpectedly. Only Beau, Johnny and Dagineau are alive. Dagineau explains that they must know reinforcements are close by. He orders Johnny up the tower. A wounded Arab shoots him in the back as he climbs the ladder. Dagineau shoots the Arab with his pistol. Beau carries Johnny's dead body into the burning barracks. He says to Dagineau \"If you touch him I'll kill you\". When Beau comes out from the barracks, Dagineau tells him the reinforcements are outside, and he fired a shot at them to buy some time to talk. He says that all the dead men are hero's and the report has to reflect the honor of the Legion. Beau says that will depend on who tells the story. They fight, and Beau kills Dagineau with the pistol.\n\nFlash forward to Beau in the infirmary from the beginning of the film. The commander ask for his report. He says everyone died defending the fort to the last man under the fine command of Sgt. Dagineau. The commander says he expected to hear that, and that Zinderneuf is to be abandoned because the cost of holding it is too high. Troopers depart on horseback through graveyard. Credits roll."

Philip treats Beckman's injuries and gives him shelter, taking only enough money to pay the church's expenses and burning the rest. Beckman, who is overwhelmed by guilt for a lifetime of violence, eventually prays to God at Philip's encouragement. When Philip dies of cancer, he asks Beckman to take over for him. Beckman has difficulty adjusting to his new life, still wracked by guilt, but that changes when a 17-year old girl named Tabitha, Philip's niece, appears on the church's front steps one night.\n\nUnwilling to talk about what has happened to her but clearly traumatized, Beckman adopts her as his own. One year later, Tabitha seems to have finally recovered, graduated from high school and on her way to college. However, her past violently reemerges when armed assailants, led by a man named Reese who appears to know her, abducts her as a helpless Beckman watches, unwittingly led there by another young parishioner named Tom. With little other recourse, Beckman contacts The Network and tracks down one of the assailants, Erik, based on a description given by Tom. Beckman tracks Erik down to a remote cabin in the desert, but after killing him and his cohorts, finds no sign of Tabitha. Using Erik's phone he calls Reese, who claims to have killed Tabitha and tells Beckman to back off. Meanwhile, Beckman is now indebted to The Network for calling on their assistance, obligated to carry out a single order from give him in the future.\n\nUsing Erik's contact list, Beckman traces another of the assailants, Janice, to a house with her brother and husband.

He rushes to Tom's apartment to find it empty, but is soon attacked by two other hitmen. He fends them off and manages to kill them just as Tom arrives, and quickly flees in a panic.

Beckman quickly realizes that they're being tailed by The Administrator, an infamous hitman with over 400 confirmed kills. They lure him into a nearby brewery and Beckman attempts to ambush him but fails, only being spared after he explains the situation to his would-be killer.\n\nBeckman takes Tom to a safehouse run by his friend Salvatore. Tom tries to talk Beckman down by reminding him of what he once preached, but Beckman pushes him away and leaves. With the help of a hacker, he manages to track down Frank to a restaurant he uses as a cover for a human trafficking ring. Beckman holds Frank at gunpoint and demands he give him Reese's location. He does, but Beckman then receives a call from The Network ordering him to cease any activity against Reese and his associates. Seeing the extent of Frank's victims, Beckman shoots him dead.\n\nBeckman drives to Reese's location at a remote ranch, where he is conducting a ritual to sacrifice his followers. He confronts him but Reese doesn't resist, telling Beckman he has no fear and asking him to shoot him. Remembering the words of Tom and Philip, Beckman refuses and leaves.

    "Beer for My Horses": "The movie begins with a man smashing a car and his wife is yelling at him with neighbors looking on. A sheriff truck pulls up and Joe Bill Rack Ranklin (Toby Keith) and his partner Lonnie (Rodney Carrington) try to settle the dispute. The man is convinced his wife is cheating on him with another man (who Lonnie later spots in his underwear and shows Rank, but he ignores it). As punishment, the husband ruins the lovers truck with a baseball bat however Rank tells him the truck he just ruined doesn't belong to the lover, but in fact belongs to Jay Bob Simpson (who later beats him up). Rack arrives home late and his girlfriend Cammie (Gina Gershon) leaves him, running over his lawnmower with her truck. Rack goes to work the next day and Sheriff Landry (Tom Skerritt) assigns Rack, Lonnie, and another deputy named Skunk (Ted Nugent), nightwatchmen duty on two of the fertilizer tanks. Lonnie takes his fat, gassy, lazy dog along for the ride. A truck pulls up and a group of Mexicans attempt to steal the tanks, but the three agents stop him. The gang celebrates by arriving at the local beer tavern, where they join the Sheriff Landy for a toast. The celebratory tradition goes by saying: Whiskey for my men. Beer for my horses. The next day on his way to the local cafe, Rack meets up with bad boy Johnny Franks (Chad Brummett) who informs him that the guy he arrested, whose name is Tito, has a brother who may be out looking for him. Rack rebuffs the threat and walks into the bar. He strikes up a conversation with the waitress, who informs him that his ex-girlfriend Annie Streets is back in town helping out her mother, and that he should go by and see her. He arrives at the house and reunites with Annie (Claire Forlani), but was thrown out by her stepfather Buck Baker (Barry Corbin) who mocked him about his father and the deputy position. He meets with Annie later and asks her out on a date, which she accepts. At the sheriffs office, Rack informs his secretary Mavis to retrieve a fax regarding Tito. District Attorney Levine (Curtis Armstrong) arrives and talks with Sheriff Landry regarding Tito. Landry makes Rack leave his office while they discuss. Levine feels he doesn't have a case against him, for stealing fertilizer tanks won't suit well with the judge. Mavis hands Rack the fax with the rundown: Tito is charged with drug racketeering and is part of a Mexican drug cartel. Rack enters Landry's office again and gives the fax to Levine, who then reconsiders the case. That night Annie and Rack go out on a date. The next morning Rack is talking to the plumber Bob when he gets interrupted by a phone call: Annie was taken by Tito's brother Manuel (Carlos Sanz) and Landry is told by him to bring Tito by noon tomorrow in Mexico or the girl will be killed. Rack calls Lonnie in the middle of the night and the two head down to Mexico (along with Skunk). Tyrone Honeybee (Tracy Morgan) helps the duo get across the border safely and timely. Honeybee is a corrupt border guard and serves primarily as a foil to Rack. They bust Tito out of jail and drive to Mexico. When they arrive, Lonnie tries to \"blend in\" by listening to a Spanish-speaking tape while Rack talks to a young kid. Rack shows a picture of Manuel and asks if the kid knows where Manuel lives and gives him a token to give to Manuel: a necklace and a cell-phone number. The kid runs over and hands it to Manuel. Manuel calls the number (Lonnies cell) and tells Rack that Annie is alive. Rack decides to meet at Rancho Cantina at noon, to which Manuel accepts. The trio wait at a nearby hotel. Manuel arrives with his men, and Rack and Skunk come face-to-face with Manuel. Rack has Tito tied up with a pillowcase over his head, and Rack is surprised to find out Annie's stepfather Buck is part of Manuel's gang. Manuel begs Rack to let his brother go, only to find out that Lonnie was wearing Titos clothes (while Tito is handcuffed to the car in his tight purple underwear). Manuel's men die in the ensuing gunfight while Buck takes Annie in the back room. Tito escapes from the car. Manuel is about ready to kill Lonnie, only to be knocked out when his brother kicks open the door. Thinking Lonnie killed Manuel, Tito raises the gun on Lonnie. Tito is taken down by the dog Junior. Rack has Buck cornered when Johnny walks in, gun pointed toward Rack. Buck tells Johnny to shoot him. Lonnie turns the gun on Buck, revealing himself to be undercover FBI agent LeVar Spurlock. Annie escapes from Bucks grasp as he aims at Rack. Rack kills Buck dead with a shot to the head.

    "Behind Enemy Lines": "In the final stages of a NATO peacekeeping mission in Bosnia in December 1995, US Navy naval flight officer Lieutenant Chris Burnett (Owen Wilson) and pilot Lieutenant Jeremy Stackhouse (Gabriel Macht), who are stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Adriatic Sea, are assigned a reconnaissance mission over Bosnia. During the reconnaissance mission, they spot suspicious activity in the demilitarized zone, in which armed factions are not allowed to engage in military activity; NATO aircraft are also prohibited from entering the area. Burnett persuades Stackhouse to fly their F/A-18 Hornet off-course to get a close look at the target and photograph it. However, both men are unaware that they photographed mass graves, and Serbs in the area spot the jet. The local Bosnian Serb Army commander, General Miroslav Lokar (Olek Krupa), is conducting a secret genocidal campaign against the local Muslim population. Not wanting the mass graves to be discovered, Lokar orders the jet to be shot down.\n\nDespite trying to outmaneuver the missiles shot at them, their aircraft is hit, and both men are forced to eject. A short while after touching ground, a Serb patrol under Lokar's command finds Stackhouse and interrogates him. Stackhouse is then executed by Sasha (Vladimir Mashkov), a tracker and one of Lokar's right-hand men. Burnett, who was observing the Serbs' interrogation of Stackhouse from a hill, screams in horror, unintentionally alerting the Serbs to his location. Wanting Burnett dead as well, Lokar orders both Sasha and his second-in-command, Colonel Bazda (Marko Igonda), to find him.\n\nBurnett contacts his commanding officer, Admiral Leslie Reigart (Gene Hackman), on high ground to inform him of what happened and is ordered to move to a certain location in order to be extracted. However, Admiral Piquet (Joaquim De Almeida) warns Reigart that the shooting down of Burnett's jet and any attempt to rescue the navigator in the no-fly zone could hamper or even cause the peace process to collapse. Therefore, as Burnett moves to the designated extraction point, Reigart tells him that he must move to a safer location miles away outside of the demilitarized zone in order to be rescued. At first, Burnett objects but Reigart persuades him into making the journey.\n\nImmediately after being informed, Burnett sees a Serb patrol led by Bazda that is looking for him. Burnett runs off as the Serbs continue their search for the downed navigator. As Burnett keeps running, he falls into the very mass graves that he and Stackhouse had photographed and hides under a dead body. When the Serbs are out of sight, Burnett continues to run. Reigart, who was watching the moment via thermal satellite imagery, decides to report Burnett's situation to the media.\n\nOn his way to the new extraction point, Burnett is nearly killed by Serb soldiers in an abandoned factory but manages to flee the scene after the Serbs are killed by mines. Later on, as Burnett has a near-encounter with Sasha, he encounters Muslim guerrillas aboard a pickup truck who offer him a ride. The guerrillas inform Burnett that they are heading to Hac, which is located within a safe area, but turns out to be a war zone in which Burnett's Serb pursuers are fighting to take control of the town. During the battle, Serb troops believe that they have found Burnett's body, but Burnett has switched uniforms with a dead Serb soldier and escaped Hac with Babic (Kamil Kollarik).\n\nThe Serbians parade the corpse wearing Burnett's uniform, but Sasha immediately notices that it is not Burnett. Although convinced, Lokar has the corpse presented on the news and the media reports the Serb claims that Burnett was killed, as Lokar fears that a rescue team tasked with rescuing Burnett may be on its way. Their ruse works and the rescue mission is called off just as Burnett gets a view of the helicopter. Burnett, disappointed, then notices an angel statue that he parachuted down nearby as this is where his ejection seat landed. Burnett, whose radio was destroyed in Hac, wants to return to the site in order to prove to his carrier group that he is still alive as well as to obtain the evidence of Lokar's crimes, which is located on a hard drive attached to the seat. Burnett orders Babic to leave, returns to his ejection seat and reactivates the rescue beacon. Even though the carrier group notices his signal, Burnett also alerts the Serbs to his location.\n\nAlthough knowing that doing so could have him relieved of command, Reigart prepares a task force aimed at rescuing Burnett. But meanwhile, General Lokar sends both Bazda and Sasha alone to kill Burnett, with Lokar instructing the latter to shoot the downed navigator in the head. On route to Burnett's location, Bazda steps on a landmine, forcing Sasha to leave the helpless soldier to die. Burnett hears the explosion and is alerted.\n\nSasha takes a position and sees Burnett hiding behind the ejection seat. After hearing approaching American helicopters coming to rescue Burnett, he walks toward the ejection seat, but after getting there, Sasha realizes that he was tricked. Burnett jumps out of a snowdrift behind Sasha and the two men engage in a hand-to-hand fight until Burnett pulls out a flare and stabs Sasha in the chest with it, killing him. Immediately after Sasha is killed, Lokar arrives with armored personnel carriers and infantry who begin to fire upon Burnett as he runs to the nearby angel statue. Three UH-1 Huey helicopters of the United States Marine Corps led by Reigart finally arrive and fire on the Serbs. After running back to the ejection chair to retrieve the hard drive containing the photos of the mass graves, Burnett runs back to the helicopter and gets in. The task force successfully withdraws back to the aircraft carrier, where Burnett receives warm applause from the carrier's crew members on the flight deck after getting off the helicopter.\n\nThe conclusion of the movie reveals that the evidence of Lokar's war crimes put him on trial. Reigart is relieved from command for his actions and is offered a desk job in Washington, D.C., but chooses to retire with the respect of his sailors for the sacrifice he made to recover the downed pilot. Burnett, who earlier in the film wanted to resign from active duty, decides to remain in the Navy."

    "Behind Enemy Lines II: Axis of Evil": "The story is not linked to the first part of the series. Instead, it focuses on a fictional explanation for the Ryanggang explosion in 2004, in which an unexplained mushroom cloud occurred in North Korea.\n\nAfter reconnaissance satellites detect a large, three-stage Topol intercontinental ballistic missile carrying a nuclear weapon in North Korea, which can strike anywhere in the continental United States, a fictional United States President Adair T. Manning (Peter Coyote) orders a team of U.S. Navy SEALs to destroy the missile and the launch site. The team is led by Lieutenant Robert James (Nicholas Gonzalez).\n\nThe Pentagon aborts the mission after it receives new information, but by the time the abort order is sent, four SEALs, including James, have already parachuted into North Korean territory. When North Korean forces led by Commander Hwang (Joseph Steven Yang) find the SEALs, two of the Navy SEALs are killed in a gun battle, and James and Callaghan are captured and tortured by North Korean troops.\n\nAfter South Korean special forces rescue James and Callaghan, President Manning and the South Korean government send the SEALs and South Korean special forces to destroy the missile site. But after losing radio contact with the SEALs, the President and his top advisers believe that they have been captured again. The President decides to send B-2 stealth bombers to destroy the site, which would start a full-scale war against North Korea. The SEALs and the South Korean special forces destroy the missile silo with a bomb before the bombers reach the missile site, which averts the bombing and prevents a full-scale war."

    "Beirut": "In 1972, Mason Skiles (Jon Hamm) is a U.S. diplomat in Lebanon and lives in Beirut with his Lebanese wife, Nadia (Leila Bekhti), and has recently begun caring for Karim (Idir Chender), a 13-year-old Palestinian boy who claims he is without a family. While hosting a party, Skiles is confronted by his friend, CIA officer Cal Riley (Mark Pellegrino), who wishes to question Karim, whose brother has been linked to the 1972 Munich massacre. The party is attacked by Karim's brother, Rami (Ben Affan), who abducts Karim; in the ensuing gunfight, Nadia is killed.\n\nTen years later, Skiles has become an alcoholic and is working as a self-employed labor arbitrator in New England. While arbitrating a labor issue between particularly intransigent parties and struggling to keep his small firm afloat, he is approached by Sully (Douglas Hodge), an old client, on behalf of the U.S. government. Sully tells Skiles that he has been requested for an academic lecture in Lebanon, and hands him money, a plane ticket, and a passport. Skiles is initially resistant but decides to travel to Beirut. He meets several State Department officials, Donald Gaines (Dean Norris), Gary Ruzak (Shea Whigham), and Frank Shalen (Larry Pine), along with CIA officer Sandy Crowder (Rosamund Pike) (a CIA field agent working undercover at the American embassy) and learns that Cal Riley was recently abducted in Lebanon, and his kidnappers requested Skiles to negotiate his release.\n\nThe group meets with the kidnappers, where they learn that Karim is leading the organization. Karim demands the release of his brother in exchange for Riley, despite the Americans' protest that they do not have Rami in captivity. Skiles suspects that Israel is holding Rami, and travels with Ruzak to secure his release for the exchange. The Israelis reveal that they do not have Rami, and Skiles returns to Beirut to meet with Alice (Kate Fleetwood), Riley's wife. Alice holds Skiles responsible for Riley's abduction, as she believes that he has remained in Lebanon over the guilt he feels for Nadia's death. Roni Niv (Alon Abutbul) meets Gary in secret and confirms that Israel doesn't have Rami in captivity. He wants Gary to publish the news of Cal's death and allow Israel to invade Lebanon to clear the place out of the PLO and other Islamist factions. Gary is skeptical of Israel & Mossad's motives and doesn't want to give up on Cal too easily.\n\nThe next day, Skiles is giving the lecture that was his official reason to travel to Beirut when a car bomb is set off outside the building. In the ensuing chaos, Skiles is instructed to leave to meet Karim. Karim brings him to Riley, who covertly tells Skiles that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is holding Rami, and that Gaines is not to be trusted. Before releasing Skiles, Karim gives him an ultimatum for later the same night to return Rami, or he will sell Riley to Iran. Skiles returns to Riley's apartment to search for clues, where he encounters Crowder. She reveals that Gaines had been stealing money from the embassy, and that Riley had been preparing to make a report shortly before his disappearance. Skiles now understands that Gaines knew about Cal's knowledge of his theft and hence has every reason that Cal is never released and dies in custody of Karim. Meanwhile Gary wants Israel to attack Lebanon so that Beirut can be cleaned off in one go. So he wants Cal to die in custody and that gives US every reason to step out of Israel's way to invade Lebanon. Skiles convinces Crowder that the PLO is holding Rami, and she steals $4 million from the CIA office to trade for Rami.\n\nAfter Skiles attacks a senior PLO officer in his own home, he sets up a trade for Rami and brings him to the exchange with Karim. After trading Riley for Rami, but then Rami decides to attack Skiles, and then Rami is shot and killed by a hidden Mossad sniper in a nearby building; the Americans successfully escape. Before departing Beirut, he learns that Gaines has unexpectedly retired, and Ruzak has left Beirut. Crowder announces her intention to apply for the newly vacant jobs, and Skiles offers his services as a negotiator."

    "Bell Bottom": "In 1984, Indian Airlines Flight 691 (resembling Indian Airlines Flight 421) is hijacked, the seventh such hijacking in India in five years, with all the previous ones ending in acquiescence to the hijackers' demands that other terrorists be freed and money be delivered. During her briefing, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi (Lara Dutta), frustrated at the lack of action taken on the matter, decides to allow a RAW agent code-named \"Bell Bottom\" (Akshay Kumar) to handle the case.\n\nAs a \"mere\" clerk, he is already viewed with consternation by the other officials, and his deduction that the alleged masterminds, a Khalistan separatist group named \"Azaadi Dal\" ('Liberation Organisation'), are merely a front for Pakistan's ISI are rebuffed by them due to improving Indo-Pakistani relations. Bell Bottom points out in each case Pakistan did successfully help India negotiate with terrorists, but in each case, India had to release terrorists and pay ransom of multiple Crores to save our citizens. R. N. Kao (Denzil Smith) is the founder of RAW and now the special advisor to the PM. He encourages Bell Bottom to speak his mind. Santook (Adil Hussain) is Bell Bottom's boss and the chief of RAW. After the plane lands in Amritsar when he predicted it would land in Lahore, he is dismissed. However, his supervisor points out that he is an expert on hijackings and is motivated by personal experience\n\nIn 1979, polymath Anshul Malhotra lives with his mother Raavie (Dolly Ahluwalia), an asthmatic who constantly visits his brother in London Aashua (Mamik Singh). Anshul's wife Radhika (Vaani Kapoor). Her flight is hijacked by terrorists, but then PM Morarji Desai (Ashok Chhabra) and Pakistani President Muhammad Zia-Ul-Haq (Kavi Raj) negotiate and fulfill the hijackers demands in exchange for the hostages' release. However, Raavie dies, reportedly due to natural causes. Soon after, though, Anshul is abducted by RAW, who reveal that one of the hijackers, Daljeet \"Doddy\" Singh (Zain Khan Durrani), had purposely withheld her inhaler, pusher her into the galley and thrown heavy blankets on her, increasing her suffering as she died. Anshul is given the offer to join RAW; he accepts and takes on the code-name Bell Bottom, with his cover to his wife being that he is an embassy officer (after having cleared UPSC). After his training, which showcases his extraordinary memory and improves his previously sub-par psychical skills, he is assigned to the hijacking desk. In 1983, he finds one of the hijackers while visiting his brother in London and tracks them; he raids their house with other RAW agents and captures three of them but the fourth, Doddy Singh, escapes. Bell Bottom proposes the theory that the hijackers are working for ISI. ISI gets the planes hijacked and flown to Lahore. The govt helps India negotiate the release of terrorists. The terrorists are given a fake trial and \"imprisoned\", while in reality, they are free to roam around and even visit other countries. This is part of Pakistan's plan to take revenge for cutting Bangladesh from them and they intend to divide India into several smaller pieces.\n\nBack in the present, the plane takes off from Amritsar and lands in Lahore, prompting Gandhi to order Anshul back in. He convinces her to \"break script\" and disallow the Pakistani side to send their negotiating team, and orders them not to refuel the plane. Bell Bottom tells Indira that now Pakistan will try to internationalize the issue. But with limited fuel, the plane cant travel far. India has better relations with Kabuk, Colombo and Kathmandu.. But Pakistan can take the plane to Dubai, Abu Dhabi or Muscat. In response, Zia sends his ISI Chief (Sunit Tandon) to keep track of the situation. In Lahore, an ISI officer replaces the hijacker with Doddy and supplies weapons and explosives. Correctly figuring that they will go to the Middle East to take advantage of their naivety in aerial terrorism, Anshul prepares for a covert operation in Dubai against the Indian ministers' wishes. Meanwhile, the Pakistani ISI Chief goes to Dubai to observe what is going on and guide Doddy.\n\nUpon arrival, Anshul and his team, disguised as diplomatic aides, meet up with a contact Adeela Rehman (Huma Qureshi) (Anshul was forced to seek help from International agencies as India did not have any covert agent in Dubai) in the Dubai airport, where they see Dubai's emphasis on humanitarianism and avoidance of bloodshed. Doddy gives his demands to ATC in Dubai, and Bell Bottom recognizes his voice. He realizes that Doddy boarded the aircraft in Lahore, as he could not have boarded in India. Dubai refuses to permission to Indian authorities to carry out any military operation on their soil. Their first plan, covertly entering the aircraft (via the luggage section) and disarming the hijackers, is foiled when the Pakistani minister notices and closes the luggage door. Anshul's \"plan B\", sending in the Indian army, is also curtailed when the Dubai officials are notified and the ship they are on is denied entry.\n\nWith all avenues cut off, the ministers go to negotiate; although they agree to the terrorists demands of money, more terrorist releases (5 of them lodged in Indian jails + 1 MM pounds), and a charter flight to London for freedom, they are surprised at the terrorists extreme inhumanity and one Indian minister is taken hostage as a \"VIP\" target to be held until they get to London. Seemingly out of options, Anshul asks their airport contact to take them to a under-construction terminal so they can view the proceedings; however this is a ruse as Anshul reveals his knowledge of Adeela's betrayal (She was passing all info to the ISI chief) and ties her up.\n\nMeanwhile Indira has called London to dispatch a charter flight with 1 MM pounds on board. The flight reaches Dubai and the hijackers with the freed terrorists, and 3 VIP hostages, exit the IA flight to board the British charter flight. Disguising themselves as airport workers, they take advantage of a sandstorm to get on the field, free the VIPs, and capture the terrorists, redirecting the charter flight to India. The leader of Dubai denies them take off clearance at first, but after Anshul explains how their methods fit in with Dubai's humanism, he grants it.\n\nIn India, the terrorists are booked, with Zia and the ISI leaders huffing in disgrace, and the flight is returned, with all on board safe and sound and reunited with their families. In the end, it is revealed that Radhika was actually working for RAW and had informed them of her husband's abilities and background in the first place. 1984 was India's first covert operation on foreign soil and brought India and Dubai together"

    "Below Zero": "In the opening scene, an injured man named Chino struggles to escape through a wood at night, but is soon caught by his pursuer. When the victim is unable to tell his attacker the location of a missing woman, the attacker buries him alive.\n\nThe action moves to a police station, where police officer Mart\u00edn (Javier Guti\u00e9rrez) is starting a new job. One of his first duties is to drive a prisoner transport vehicle at night. He will be partnered with Officer Montesino (Isak F\u00e9rriz) during the transfer of six prisoners. During the strip search of the prisoners prior to departure, Montesino displays an aggressive attitude, deliberately humiliating some of the men. Mart\u00edn, who believes in obeying the rules, prevents Montesino from striking one of the prisoners. The prison transport vehicle is escorted by a police car with two officers, driving ahead. When the transport vehicle enters a foggy patch on the road, Mart\u00edn loses sight of the police car, as well as radio contact. Then the truck is brought to a sudden stop by a spiked strip lying across the road. Montesino goes outside to assess the situation, but then Mart\u00edn also loses radio contact with him.\n\nMart\u00edn gets out himself to investigate and finds Montesino unconscious and bleeding. Someone then starts shooting at him from the trees. Running for cover, Mart\u00edn finds the overturned police car with both officers shot dead. Mart\u00edn returns fire at the sniper, emptying his gun. He makes it back to the transport vehicle, but is shot in the leg. In the cabin of the truck, he tries to call headquarters, but when the sniper shoots at the windscreen he retreats into the prisoners' section.\n\nOne of the prisoners had earlier managed to access a hidden lock pick, and used it to remove his handcuffs and open his cell. He tries to overpower Mart\u00edn, but the officer holds him off with his gun. Then gasoline is poured into two of the cells (from tubes through the ventilation grilles) and set alight. Mart\u00edn has to open the cells to save the prisoners, although one man, Pardo (Miquel Gelabert), has already died. The freed prisoners open the other cells and Mart\u00edn is surrounded. He still tries to hold them off with his weapon, but then a message comes through the radio, announcing to the prisoners that Mart\u00edn's gun is, in fact, empty, and that they should take his key and escape. All, that is, except a young prisoner called Nano (Patrick Criado), who is wanted by the man who has staged the hijack. Nano responds to this by beating to death another prisoner, Mihai (Florin Opritescu), a foreigner, whom Nano insists has masterminded the whole thing, and that it is nothing to do with him. Nano has also managed to get hold of Mart\u00edn's key.\n\nThe hijacker, Miguel (Karra Elejalde), who has entered the truck's cabin, sends another radio message, telling the men that if they do not hand over Nano they will all die. A brawl ensues, with the men trying to get the key off Nano, but he swallows it. Mart\u00edn is overpowered and knocked unconscious by prisoner Ramis (Luis Callejo). When he comes to, he is locked in an area at one end of the truck, along with Nano, while the other men try to figure out a way to open the exit door. Ramis asks Mart\u00edn if he remembers him? Apparently he performed in a band at Mart\u00edn's wedding.\n\nMiguel starts the truck and begins to drive. In the back, the heating has been turned off and as it is winter the men are freezing. One of the prisoners, Rei (\u00c9dgar Vittorino), enters a storage compartment under the truck and tries to unscrew a panel. However, Montesino, whom Mart\u00edn had believed to be dead, has begun to revive. Although wounded, he finds Miguel's jeep hidden in the trees. In the glove box is a gun, and also numerous photos of a young woman. Newspaper cuttings reveal her to be Miguel's missing daughter, Soledad \"Sole\" Garc\u00eda.\n\nMontesino transmits a distress call to headquarters and then drives after the prisoner transport truck. When he catches up with it, he fires through the side window of the cab, but Miguel manages to drive him off the road. Montesino hits a tree, and dies from his injuries. Meanwhile, Rei has also died, having been impaled on a long metal screw in the storage compartment, while the truck was swerving about. Inside the truck, Mart\u00edn talks with Nano, trying to discover what this is all about. Nano insists he does not know. Miguel had mentioned the name Chino (\u00c0lex Monner) in one of his radio messages, and Nano says that this is someone he grew up with, and who is like a brother to him.\n\nMiguel continues to drive as dawn breaks over the snowy landscape. He drives the truck into the middle of a frozen lake and shoots at the surrounding ice so that the vehicle begins to sink. Then he walks off. As freezing water begins to fill the truck, Mart\u00edn tells Ramis to release him so that he can reveal an emergency exit. Mart\u00edn, Nano and Ramis escape through this exit, but the remaining prisoner, Gollum (Andr\u00e9s Gertr\u00fadix), succumbs to the cold and dies.\n\nNano runs off after climbing out of the lake. Ramis and Mart\u00edn shake hands before they part; Ramis wants to pursue his dream of opening a bar in the Caribbean. Mart\u00edn makes his way to a nearby village, where he hears gunfire. Miguel is stationed in a high building, firing at Nano, who is hiding in the street below. Mart\u00edn creeps up behind Miguel, but is held off by Miguel's shotgun. Miguel explains why he is doing this; he had allowed his 13 year old daughter Sole to visit a fair with her friend. Nano and his friend Chino separated Sole from her girlfriend, and persuaded her to drink some shots. Unused to alcohol, she was soon drunk and then the boys took turns raping her. They then tortured her, with cigarette butts, pliers and a bottle. Finally they tied her to a car and dragged her through the fields until she died.\n\nNano, already a hardened criminal, with numerous jail sentences behind him, was suspected of the crime, but the police could not prove anything. However, Miguel tracked down Chino, who confessed under torture to what they had done - only he did not know where Nano had hidden Sole's body (it was Chino who was buried alive in the opening scene). All Miguel now wants is to retrieve his daughter's body so that he can give her a proper burial. Mart\u00edn says he cannot permit Miguel to kill Nano. Miguel says he understands, as he was once a police officer. The men grapple for the shotgun and Mart\u00edn overpowers Miguel and takes the weapon, but Miguel runs off in pursuit of Nano.\n\nMart\u00edn follows and finds Miguel beating Nano. Mart\u00edn makes him back off, whereupon Nano sneers at Miguel, saying he will never reveal the location of his daughter's body. Hearing this, Mart\u00edn shoots Nano in the foot, and then blasts his hand off, demanding he tell Miguel where Sole is. In agony, Nano finally confesses that she is buried in a well on a farm. As he makes this revelation, a police rescue helicopter arrives. In a final scene, Mart\u00edn clears out his locker at headquarters and leaves the building, presumably having also left his police career behind him."

    "Ben 10/Generator Rex: Heroes United": "A mysterious rift begins to open in the skies of Manhattan. Meanwhile, former agent of peacekeeping organization, \"Providence\", Rex Salazar is sparring against fellow agent, Agent Six, while musing about his need for a theme song, before getting the alert about the rift. Providence appears on the scene to stop the rift, but are unable to do anything before Rex arrives with Six and Bobo. Doctor Holiday, scientist and love interest of Agent Six, then gets a scan that shows something is coming through the rift, and Rex finds himself (unknowingly) fighting against Ben Tennyson, in the form of Humungousaur. During their skirmish, a strange metallic creature also appears and heads into the city, with Bobo and Six on its trail. Ben switches to Rath as Rex continues to try curing him; an annoyed Ben demands Rex stop as he doesn't even know what an EVO is. Changing back to human form, Ben is shocked that no one has heard of him despite being a celebrity. Then, Six appears with the creature, which self-destructs and renders him comatose, leaving Rex mortified and angered at Ben.\n\nAt Rex's hideout, Ben is locked up in a containment unit, while Doctor Holiday explains that the creature was nanite in origin, but somehow completely different from an EVO. Ben offers help but is denied, and escapes into the night as Big Chill. Rex chases after Ben and both confronted by Caesar, who explains the creature's origin, saying that he created the creature (named \"Alpha\") as a means of manufacturing nanites that could adapt for any scientific need, but it became rogue as it developed sentience and tried to possess human bodies due to its inability to hold a physical form within a machine, forcing Caesar to banish it to another dimension. However, Ben reveals that Caesar actually sent Alpha into the Null Void, a prison dimension for intergalactic criminals that the Plumbers capture, allowing Alpha to obtain a physical form within an alien and find its way back to Manhattan. Alpha invades to absorb EVOs for their nanites, hoping to gain control of Rex's as it knows he holds the key to it obtaining perfection.\n\nBack at base Ben and Rex explain each other's origins, as White Knight reveals that Alpha has gone to the Bug Jar, which is full of EVOs for it to absorb. Rex, White Knight, and Ben arrive, only to find themselves against the nearly invincible Alpha, which begins to attack to take control of Rex's Omega Nanite. Ben fights as XLR8 and Four Arms. During the battle, Ben gains the form of Shocksquatch, but then temporarily loses his powers when Alpha copies the Ultimatrix and takes on Nanite powered versions of Heatblast, Fourarms, and Humungousaur. After a tough battle, Rex is able to disable Alpha's imitation Omnitrix powers, but is ensnared and robbed of his Omega Nanite, leading to Nanite Alpha to transform into a colossal being calling itself Alpha-Omega; the beginning and the end. As the now nearly unstoppable Alpha-Omega rampages, Rex has doubts about himself now that most of his builds are gone. Ben however comes up with a plan, and transforms into Upgrade and merges with Rex. The duo then take on the Alpha-Omega, weakening it enough for Rex to finally condense Alpha into a sphere of matter that weighs several tons. As Alpha was being condensed, Caesar appears and extracts the Omega Nanite. Attempting to dispose of Alpha, Caesar then opens a rift for Ben, who changes into Upchuck and devours the compacted Alpha as he heads back to his world. Rex returns to base, one last time, to find himself with a revived Agent Six. Caesar injects the Omega Nanite into Rex, as Alpha, now in the Null Void, begins to stir within its prison of matter, meaning it is not over yet."

    "Ben 10: Destroy All Aliens": "Taking place shortly after the events of the original Ben 10, Ben, Gwen and Grandpa Max spend their evenings fighting aliens on the streets of Bellwood. During a battle against a robotic tank, Ben as Upgrade and Gwen argue about the best way to defeat it, leading to Gwen using her extraordinarily strong pink-colored magic to cast a dismantling spell on the tank while Ben is attached to it. Unknown to the children, this leads to a malfunction in the Omnitrix.\n\nLater, after a mishap in school where the Omnitrix accidentally teleports his homework away, Ben is grounded by his parents and forced to stay home and do a history report. Ben attempts to work on the report before the Omnitrix teleports his laptop away as well. Shortly afterwards, Tetrax Shard arrives and tells Ben that Azmuth has asked to meet with him. They go to meet Azmuth but are attacked by an evil version of Waybig. Tetrax and Ben fight the alien, who is teleported into the Omnitrix, though neither of them is aware of it. Tetrax decides to take Ben to search for Azmuth and activates a new function on the Omnitrix. Before he can explain this new ability, the ship is attacked and Ben is sucked out into the atmosphere, falling to the ground as Diamondhead. It is later revealed that the new ability prevents Ben from returning to human form when he times out, simply switching alien forms. Ben as Fourarms arrives at Stonehenge and is attacked by a weaponizing Galvanic Mechamorph who demands to know about the alien that attacked Ben. Ben tries to explain he knows nothing, but the Mechamorph only continues to attack and the Mechamorph's teleporting ability causes the pair to carry their battle across the globe, destroying part of Stonehenge and nearly damaging Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro and fighting at the Great Pyramids in Egypt before arriving back in Bellwood. Ben transforms into Grey Matter and manages to escape the Mechamorph.\n\nMeanwhile, Gwen and Grandpa Max receive a call from Ben's parents Carl and Sandra informing them that Ben has escaped the house. They go in search of him, only to find Tetrax and discover Azmuth's ship. Looking at the ship's log, they discover that Azmuth disguised it as a semi truck to track down and fix the malfunctioning Omnitrix, but crashed and was destroyed by the evil Waybig. After escaping the Mechamorph, they soon encounter Ben back at his house and Tetrax restores Ben's Omnitrix to normal just as the Mechamorph catches up to them. Gwen sees how the Omnitrix reacts after Ben returns to human form and deduces what has happened just as she, Ben, Tetrax and the Mechamorph are transported into the Omnitrix itself.\n\nInside, Ben and the Mechamorph continue to battle before being attacked by a swarm of Stinkflies just as Gwen and Tetrax are ambushed by a herd of Wildmutt. The four catch up with each other and they realize that the evil Waybig is inside with them just as he resurfaces. The Mechamorph, who is revealed to be Azmuth's father, attacks the Waybig in revenge for killing his son while Gwen explains to Ben about the malfunction that she caused to the Omnitrix when she cast the dismantling spell on the robotic tank while Ben was attached to it. She uses Azmuth's father to reverse the transportation and return them to Earth. Unfortunately, the Omnitrix malfunctions again and transforms Ben's parents into Wildmutt and Heatblast, causing Gwen to realize that the evil Waybig is Azmuth himself. Leaving Grandpa Max and Tetrax to handle his parents, Ben and Gwen follow Azmuth's father and Azmuth to the city park where Ben transforms into Waybig to subdue Azmuth and hold off his father while he and Gwen try to reverse the transformation. Between the two Waybigs, they do a few hundred million dollars in property damage from smashing huge building after huge building (there are most likely no one in the buildings as the battle takes place in the morning before people arrive to work in them, which may be why they are not concerned about huge loss of life). They soon convince Azmuth's father that his son is the very alien that they are fighting and the three work together to convince Azmuth to regain control of himself, use his father's Mechamorph abilities to fix the Omnitrix and return Azmuth to normal. Azmuth reprimands Ben and Gwen for their errors and reveals his father is a Galvan wielding Mechamorph-type enhanced armor. Azmuth reveals that the Omnitrix was so filled with pink mana; Gwen asks what he means, to which he simply says that she will know eventually.\n\nReturning to Ben's house, Azmuth restores Ben's parents to normal and repairs the Rust bucket, previously destroyed in the battle, before leaving to reconcile with his own father. Ben's parents, having forgotten that they grounded Ben, tell him to enjoy his fishing trip with Grandpa Max and Gwen. Ben declines, having learned to be more responsible, and stays home to finish his history report for school. The movie ends with Ben, Gwen, and Grandpa Max on another road trip where they encounter Doctor Animo and the three prepare for another exciting battle."

    "Ben 10: Race Against Time": "Taking place after the series, the story opens in Bellwood as a mysterious figure appears immediately starts destroying things. Ben Tennyson (Graham Phillips), in the form of Heatblast (voiced by David Franklin), confronts him. After a short battle, Ben seemingly obliterates the villain.\n\nThe next day, Ben goes back to school, and has trouble adjusting to normal life again. After a bad day he gets bullied by Cash (Tyler Patrick Jones), JT (Tyler Foden) and two girls he tried to flirt with earlier in the movie resulting in Greymatter (voiced by Carlos Alazraqui) causing complete chaos at a diner where Ms. Dalton (Aloma Wright) works. Later he and Gwen Tennyson (Haley Ramm) go over some yearbook photos she took. In the background of one with Ben, Gwen enhances a blurred spot and reveals the same villain Ben defeated earlier. Max Tennyson (Lee Majors) identifies him as Eon (Christien Anholt), an alien the Plumbers captured almost two centuries ago. When he arrived, he was half dead and brought a device with him called the Hands of Armageddon, which would open a time rift to the alien's home dimension and unleash his race upon Earth if activated. They travel to the containment facility where Eon is supposed to be kept, only to find it empty and his guardian aged to near-death.\n\nTraveling back to Bellwood, Max takes Ben and Gwen to the location of the Hands of Armageddon, guarded by the few remaining Plumbers ranging from Ms. Dalton, Mr. Hawkins the postman (Jeff Jensen), Fire Chief Whittington (Michael Runyard), and Principal White (Robert Picardo). Eon has followed them and breaks into the facility, but cannot activate the device. When Ben attempts to use the Omnitrix, it malfunctions, glowing purple and refusing to activate. Eon attempts to kidnap Ben, claiming it to be a rescue, but Ben escapes. Eon manages to corner Ben, explaining that his race learned to control time itself, but trapped themselves by misusing their power. He claims that his fate is intertwined with Ben's. Eon is scared off by an old man (Sab Shimono) who happens to be another Plumber before he can elaborate. Grandpa Max decides it would be best for Ben to leave Bellwood so that Eon won't find him, but Ben bravely refuses and they both come to a deal where Ben will be monitored daily by a Plumber in disguise.\n\nThe Plumbers, all around town, guard Ben around the clock. When Ben goes to the school gym to be alone, Principal White attempts to calm Ben's fears just when Eon arrives again and shoves White out of the way. This time, Ben is able to become Diamondhead (voiced by Daran Norris) and fight him off. Later on that day, Ben decides to lure Eon into a trap by purposefully leaving himself open, but this backfires and he is captured along with Gwen and Max.\n\nAt the Plumber facility storing the Hands of Armageddon, Eon explains some of the background of the Omnitrix: Ben can only remain in his alien forms for ten minutes at a time, a failsafe to prevent them from overwhelming his personality. Eon knows how to deactivate the failsafe, and in doing so can resurrect himself through the Omnitrix. He does so, and Ben is transformed into a younger version of Eon. The older one retreats since there are now two of him. Reborn, Eon activates the Hands of Armageddon. Gwen and Max manage to free themselves and work to stop him. While Max tries to disable the time rift, potentially at the cost of his own life, Gwen appeals to Ben inside Eon. Ben successfully overcomes Eon, and with the help of the other Plumbers manages to save Max and disable the time rift, sending Eon's race back to their own dimension.\n\nJust when it seems like they've won, time stops for everyone but Ben. The older Eon reappears, angered at Ben's victory. Ben transforms into Wildmutt (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) and fights him off, eventually knocking him into the Hands of Armageddon, destroying both the Hands and Eon. After doing an impromptu magic trick for the school talent show, using Wildmutt's timely de-transformation and a well placed stage curtain, Ben finally accepts being just Ben for a while. However, Max points out that aliens are persistent, and as the film ends, an alien ship, resembling Vilgax's, flies towards Earth."

    "Ben-Hur": "After the title sequence, on-screen text informs the audience that it is now AD 26. Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) is a wealthy prince and merchant in Jerusalem. Childhood friend, the Roman citizen Messala (Stephen Boyd), is now a tribune. After several years away from Jerusalem, Messala returns as the new commander of the Roman garrison. Messala believes in the glory of Rome and its imperial power, while Ben-Hur is devoted to his faith and the freedom of the Hebrew people. Messala asks Ben-Hur for the names of Hebrews who criticize the Romans. Ben-Hur refuses.\n\nBen-Hur lives with his mother, Miriam (Martha Scott), and sister, Tirzah (Cathy O'Donnell). Their loyal slave Simonides (Sam Jaffe) is preparing for an arranged marriage for his daughter, Esther (Haya Harareet). Ben-Hur gives Esther her freedom as a wedding present, and the audience is shown that Ben-Hur and Esther are in love even though her marriage to another man is imminent.\n\nDuring the parade for the new governor of Judea, Valerius Gratus, a tile falls from the roof of Ben-Hur's house. Gratus is thrown from his horse and nearly killed. Although Messala knows this was an accident, he condemns Ben-Hur to the galleys and imprisons Miriam and Tirzah. By punishing a known friend and prominent citizen, he hopes to intimidate the Hebrew populace. Ben-Hur swears to take revenge. Dying of thirst when his slave gang arrives at Nazareth, Ben-Hur collapses. But a local carpenter (whom the audience realizes is Jesus) gives him water.\n\nAfter three years as a galley slave, Ben-Hur is assigned to the flagship of the Roman Consul Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins), who has been charged with destroying a fleet of Macedonian pirates. Arrius admires Ben-Hur's self-discipline and offers to train him as a gladiator or charioteer. Ben-Hur declines the offer, declaring that God will aid him in his quest for vengeance.\n\nThe Roman fleet encounters the Macedonians. Arrius orders all the rowers except Ben-Hur to be chained to their benches. Arrius' galley is rammed and sunk, but Ben-Hur unchains the other rowers, and saves Arrius' life. Arrius believes the battle ended in defeat, but Ben-Hur prevents him from committing suicide. Ben-Hur and Arrius are rescued, and Arrius is credited with the Roman fleet's victory. The consul successfully petitions Emperor Tiberius (George Relph) to free Ben-Hur, and adopts him as his son. Several years pass off-screen. Now wealthy, Ben-Hur learns Roman ways and becomes a champion charioteer, but longs for his family and homeland.\n\nBen-Hur returns to Judea. Along the way, he meets Balthasar (Finlay Currie) and an Arab sheikh, Ilderim (Hugh Griffith). The sheikh has heard of Ben-Hur's prowess as a charioteer, and asks him to drive his Quadriga in a race before the new Judean governor Pontius Pilate (Frank Thring). Ben-Hur at first declines, but changes his mind when he learns that champion charioteer Messala will also compete.\n\nBen-Hur returns to his home in Jerusalm. He meets Esther, and learns her arranged marriage did not occur and that she is still in love with him. He visits Messala and demands his mother and sister's freedom. The Romans discover that Miriam and Tirzah contracted leprosy in prison, and expel them from the city. The women beg Esther to conceal their condition from Ben-Hur, so she tells him that his mother and sister died.\n\nDuring the chariot race, Messala drives a chariot with blades on the hubs to tear apart competing vehicles. In the violent and grueling race, Messala attempts to destroy Ben-Hur's chariot but destroys his own instead. Messala is mortally injured, while Ben-Hur wins the race. Before dying, Messala tells Ben-Hur that \"the race is not over\" and that he can find his family \"in the Valley of the Lepers, if you can recognize them.\" Ben-Hur visits the nearby leper colony, where (hidden from their view) he sees his mother and sister.\n\nEsther hears Jesus preach the Sermon on the Mount, and tells Ben-Hur about the message of peace and forgiveness she heard. Blaming Roman rule for his family's fate, Ben-Hur rejects his patrimony and Roman citizenship. Learning that Tirzah is dying, Ben-Hur and Esther take her and Miriam to see Jesus, but the trial of Jesus before Pontius Pilate has begun. Jesus begins his march to Calvary and stumbles before Ben-Hur.\n\nRecognizing Jesus from their earlier meeting, Ben-Hur attempts to give him water but guards separate them. Ben-Hur witnesses the crucifixion of Jesus. Miriam and Tirzah are miraculously healed. Ben-Hur tells Esther that he heard Jesus talk of forgiveness while on the cross, and says \"I felt His voice take the sword out of my hand.\" The film ends with a shot of the empty crosses of Calvary and a shepherd and his flock."

    "Ben-Hur": "A Hebrew nobleman, Judah Ben-Hur (Jack Huston) and his adoptive Roman brother Messala (Toby Kebbell) are best friends despite their different origins. While racing horses, Ben-Hur is hurt and Messala carries him back to their family home in Jerusalem. Despite the hospitality of Ben Hur's mother Naomi (Ayelet Zurer) and the affections of sister Tirzah (Sofia Black D'Elia), Messala feels alienated in his adopted family. He enlists in the Roman army and fights in the Roman Empire's wars in Germany. Ben-Hur also develops feelings for the family slave Esther (Nazanin Boniadi) although their different station in life compels him not to pursue her. But when her father Simonides (Haluk Bilginer) seeks to marry her off to a Roman, Judah declares his love for her and takes her as his wife.\n\nThree years later, Messala returns as a decorated Roman officer. His return coincides with a rising insurrection by the Zealots, who are opposed to the oppressive nature of Roman rule. Judah treats and shelters a young Zealot youth named Dismas (Mois\u00e9s Arias). Messala reunites with Ben-Hur and attempts to convince his adoptive brother to serve as an informant. Following a reunion dinner with Ben-Hur and his family, Messala informs them that a new Roman governor Pontius Pilate (Pilou Asb\u00e6k) will be taking residence in Jerusalem and that no incidents must occur.\n\nDays later, Pontius Pilate marches into Jerusalem with Ben-Hur and his family watching from a balcony. Dismas attempts to assassinate Pilate with a bow but fails. In retaliation, the Romans storm Ben-Hur's household and arrest him and his family. Rather than betray a fellow Hebrew, Ben-Hur takes responsibility for the assassination attempt and is sentenced to enslavement aboard a galley. His mother and sister are sentenced to be crucified. Ben-Hur and Messala fall out with the two hating each other for their perceived betrayals. While being led to the galley, Ben-Hur encounters Jesus (Rodrigo Santoro), who fetches him some water.\n\nBen-Hur endures five years of slavery as a rower aboard a Roman galley under the command of Quintus Arius (James Cosmo). During a naval battle against Greek rebels, Ben-Hur's galley is destroyed, and he manages to cling to a floating mast. He is washed ashore and is found by Sheik Ilderim (Morgan Freeman), who recognizes him as an escaped slave. Ben-Hur manages to convince Ilderim not to hand him over to the Romans by treating one of the Nubian's racing horses. After Ben-Hur develops a bond with the four racing horses, a grateful Ilderim then trains Ben-Hur to be a chariot racer.\n\nBen-Hur and Sheik Ilderim later travel to Jerusalem to take part in a grand chariot race at the newly built Roman circus. Jesus' preaching ministry draws the attention of Governor Pilate and Messala, who is now the commander of the Roman garrison and a champion chariot racer. While visiting Jerusalem, Ben-Hur encounters Esther, who has become a follower of Jesus and is involved in charity work. Esther tells Ben-Hur that his mother and sister are dead, and despite their reunion, the two are kept emotionally apart due to her new cause which is contrary to Judah's insistence on seeking revenge against Messala.\n\nBen-Hur later confronts Messala alone in their former home but is forced to flee when Roman soldiers turn up. After the Romans execute twenty Hebrews in reprisal, Esther completely falls out with Ben-Hur. Sheik Ilderim instructs Ben-Hur in chariot racing techniques as he knows the Pontius is fond of wagers & he wants desperately to humiliate the Romans (Ilderim's son was branded a rebel and executed, so Ilderim needs revenge). Later, Ben-Hur encounters a former Roman soldier named Druses (Marwan Kenzari), who informs him that his mother Naomi and sister Tirzah are still alive. However, their reunion is soured when Ben-Hur discovers his mother and sister have leprosy, the former also appearing to have lost her memory.\n\nSheik Ilderim bribes Pilate into allowing Ben-Hur to compete by proposing a high wager (he offers 6:1 odds for a rich bet of 3000 gold coins, but asks Pilate that if his man wins, any and all claims against him would be dropped). Esther tries to convince Messala not to race Ben-Hur, but he is adamant that he will win. On the day of the race, Ben-Hur follows Ilderim's instructions to hold back from the race until the final laps. Using dirty tactics, Messala manages to knock out the other competing charioteers. Following a brutal and grueling race, Ben-Hur wins the race. Messala survives but is badly wounded and loses a leg. Ben-Hur's victory embolden the Hebrew spectators and yields dividends for Ilderim.\n\nDespite his victory, Ben-Hur is despondent about his family and his former friend Messala. Later, Esther witnesses the arrest of Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane. Ben-Hur and Esther witness a bruised and beaten Jesus being forced to carry his cross through the streets. Mirroring his first encounter with Jesus, Ben-Hur tries to offer Jesus water but is beaten by a Roman soldier. Following Jesus' crucifixion, a rainstorm occurs. Naomi and Tirzah are miraculously healed by rainwater containing the blood of Jesus, and Sheik Ilderim pays a ransom to set them free. In the end, Ben-Hur reconciles with Messala. Despite his anger, Messala finds the strength to forgive Ben-Hur and is reconciled to him and his family. Together, Ben-Hur, his mother, sister, Esther, and Messala accompany Sheik Ilderim's caravan as they leave Jerusalem."

    "Beowulf": "Set in a post apocalyptic future instead of a 16th century England, a perimeter of a nameless castle in a nameless kingdom, a murderous cult guards camped outside. The beast Grendel attacks the castle but disappears in the shadows when the king Hrothgar challenges him. A woman tries to escape the kingdom but is captured by the cult and set to be killed. She is rescued when a lone warrior named Beowulf arrives and orders them to release her. They refuse and he fights the cult until the leader agrees to let them go so long as they both enter the castle. Beowulf agrees but the woman tries to escape again but is decapitated by the cult. Beowulf enters the castle and is looked down upon the guards but does not try to deny his guilt. He meets the king telling him that \"the Darkness\" has brought him here.\n\nHe meets Hrothgar's daughter Kira and the two converse.

    "Beowulf": "Movie opens up with a celebration in the Great Hall of Heorot, built by Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins), king of the Danes. The Danes are celebrating the completion of the Hall, and theyre really boozing it up and partying quite loudly. Booziest of all is Hrothgar himself quite inebriated, half-naked, slurring his words and barely able to keep his balance. He's somewhat repulsive and a bit of an embarrassment to his young wife, Queen Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn).\n\nThe revelers begin to chant, pounding the ground in time with the chanting. The camera pulls away from the Hall, to the snowy hills surrounding the kingdom, where the chanting and thumping have died out and all is silent. Finally, we pull into a cave miles away, where the chanting and thumping are suddenly heard at an almost unbearably loud level. We hear something in the cave screaming in pain, as if the noise is too much for it to bear.\n\nBack to Heorot, where after-hours are still rocking full-blast. The large wooden entrance doors are blasted off their hinges, the halls torches blow out, and the hearth in the middle of the hall erupts in eerie blue flames. People start wigging, as we hear same the something from the cave screaming right outside Heorot's doorway. As the Danes gird their loins and take up arms, the creature enters.\n\nIt's huge, about 15 feet tall and vaguely humanoid in appearance, but clearly not all human. Its misshapen, deformed, and appears to have, instead of ears, some highly sensitive pads that serve as hearing organs. The screaming of the Danes seems to hurt the creatures ears and, enraged, he begins to tear the revelers apart, literally.\n\nEventually, the creature makes his way to Hrothgar, who, to his credit, didn't run away in a drunken panic, but held his ground. The King demands that the monster fight him, but the creature is unafraid. It simply takes a long almost quizzical look at Hrothgar and abruptly withdraws.\n\nBack at his cave, the monster is chastised by his mother for killing men. We don't see his mother, though we catch glimpses of her reflection in the caves pool. We cant tell exactly what she is, but we see enough to know that she isn't even remotely human.\n\nThe dead are removed from Heorot and burned, and the Hall is sealed as a place of evil. Hrothgar confers with his majordomo Unferth (John Malkovich). We come to find that the creature is named Grendel (Crispin Glover), and that it has apparently plagued these Danes in the past. The King tells Unferth to put out the word that the man who slays Grendel will earn half of the kingdoms riches in return. The King pointedly states that they need a hero.\n\nWe cut to a ship at sea, the mainsail bearing the likeness of a large wolf. The ship is navigating a brutal storm, and at the prow we see our hero, Beowulf (Ray Winstone), and his lieutenant and good friend, Wiglaf (Brendan Gleeson). They are unfazed by the extremely rough seas, and discuss with much bravado how they are on their way to take up Hrothgar's offer and slay Grendel, and how the glory of their deeds will live eternally.\n\nThey land on Danish shores and are taken to Hrothgar, who greets Beowulf warmly, apparently having known his father. Beowulf asks that Heorot be reopened, and Hrothgar acquiesces, providing Beowulf and his crew with food, drink and lodging as they rest in preparation for their battle.\n\nIn the revelry, Beowulf catches the eye of Queen Wealthow (and vice versa), although the two exchange nothing more than polite pleasantries. Unferth seems angered by Beowulf's presence, and calls him out. Seems that Unferth has heard a story about Beowulf being challenged to a swimming race and losing. How, Unferth asks, can Beowulf be expected to slay Grendel if he can't even outswim a human opponent in a simple race.\n\nAfter trading some insults with Unferth, Beowulf admits the tale is true, but explains why he lost the race. As Beowulf narrates, in flashback we see him swimming in the ocean against his opponent, only to be set upon by a giant sea monster. As his competitor swims to safety, Beowulf fights and kills the monster, and another, and another each in increasingly fantastic fashion. It is implied that this tale is somewhat exaggerated, though not altogether untrue. The flashback shows us something that Beowulf pointedly does not tell the Danes that after fighting the monsters underwater, Beowulf came across a siren/mermaid/water nymph. Shes breathtakingly beautiful, in an otherworldly sort of way, and Beowulf cant take his eyes off her.\n\nWe snap back to the present (no mention of what finally happened with the mermaid), and Beowulf and Unferth are still hostile toward each other. Hrothgar breaks it up, retiring to his chambers while the Queen sings a song for the Geats (Beowulf and crew, a.k.a. folks from Sweden), though the song is clearly meant for Beowulf alone. When the Queen finally retires, and Hrothgar demands that she get in bed and produce an heir, Wealthow states that she could never lie with the King, knowing that you laid down with her. The King is duly shamed, though were not told exactly why.\n\nThe Danes all pack it in, leaving Beowulf and crew in the Hall to prepare for Grendel. Beowulf notes that he will fight Grendel hand-to-hand, since no weapon seems to harm the monster anyway. Further with the machismo, Beowulf strips naked, planning to fight Grendel unclothed. The Geats start chanting Beowulf's name, and the noise reaches Grendel's cave and he screams in pain.\n\nBack to the Hall, the torches go out, blue flames burst out of the hearth, and something pounds at the reinforced doors. Grendel comes crashing through as before, killing Geats left and right until Beowulf comes into the battle, in all his nakedness. Beowulf is very strong and agile, and knows how to fight Grendel (suggesting that the sea monster story wasn't entirely a bunch of hooey), and they spar back and forth until Beowulf notices that Grendel reacts painfully to loud noises. He promptly jumps onto Grendel's back and hammers at the beast's sensitive earpads, which causes the monster extreme pain. As Grendel tries to retreat, his arm is caught in some chains, and Beowulf grabs hold, preventing Grendel from escaping just as the monster goes out the big main door. Grendel's arm is pinned between the door and the doorjamb, and Beowulf, after victoriously announcing his name to the monster, rips off Grendel's arm. Grendel flees to his cave.\n\nBeowulf holds up the arm in victory, claiming he's killed Grendel, and most of the Geats cheer his name in celebration. Wiglaf does not, being much more concerned and upset with the lives lost in the battle.\n\nBack in the cave, Grendel is dying. We hear his mother asking who did this to him, and Grendel says Beowulf before he dies. Grendel's mother sings a lullaby as she carries her boys body to an altar of sorts. As she places the body down, her voice starts to crack and she sobs before starting to scream with rage.\n\nBack in Heorot, Hrothgar is holding another celebration in honor of Beowulf. Unferth apologizes for doubting him, and Wealthow is even more smitten with their hero. The King gives Beowulf a golden horn, the standard of the Danish kingdom, as part of his reward. The horn is in the shape of a dragon, with a red jewel at the neck, and Hrothgar makes an off-hand remark about how hitting the neck is the only way to kill a dragon. Wiglaf is still upset, and goes down to the shore to prepare their ship for departure the next morning.\n\nLater, the Geats are all passed out in the Hall after their celebration, and we get a first-persons view of Grendel's mother as she flies into the Hall and tries to figure out which man is Beowulf. She correctly singles out the man who is the biggest and strongest, and appears to him in a dream as Wealthow, begging Beowulf to give her a son. Beowulf realizes he is dreaming and wakes up just as Wealthow's face starts to turn into something demonic. He looks around the Hall to see that all of his men (except Wiglaf, who was down at the shore) have been slaughtered, their bodies strung from the rafters.\n\nLater on, when people start to suspect that Grendel isn't really dead, Hrothgar explains that the Geats were killed by Grendel's mother, about whom the King seems to know a great deal. When pressed about who is Grendels father, the King is evasive. It is implicitly clear that Hrothgar himself was Grendel's father (explaining why Grendel didnt kill him earlier). Unferth gives Beowulf his family's sword to assist him in killing Grendel's mother.\n\nBeowulf and Wiglaf set out for the cave to kill Grendel's mother and avenge their men. Beowulf insists on going in alone, golden horn and Unferth's sword in tow. The cave is dark, but the horn magically glows to light the way. Beowulf finds an alcove filled with gold, as well as a lot of human bodies, and the altar holding Grendel's body. Suddenly, Grendel's mother's voice comes out of nowhere asking who Beowulf is, and we see her slowly rise out of the water, apparently having shape-shifted into human form. Beowulf is rightly transfixed, in a manner very similar to when he saw the mermaid in his sea monster story. Beowulf's seems to be easily susceptible to the charms of the mystical lady-creatures.\n\nShe admires how handsome and strong he is. Beowulf tries to run her through with Unferth's sword, but it just passes through her like shes a ghost. She comes up to him and tempts him with the promise of a kingdom and eternal glory, only if he lay with her and give her another son to replace the one he took. She grabs hold of Unferth's blade and it melts like butter. It is apparent that she could slaughter Beowulf at any time. Beowulf doesnt fight her as she sidles closer to him and grabs Hrothgar's dragon horn. There's clearly some kind of connection there, as she says that her promise is valid as long as she has that horn. And Beowulf seems on the verge of yielding to her offer.\n\nJump cut to Beowulf marching back into Heorot, tossing Grendel's head at the Kings feet. Beowulf claims that he not only made sure Grendel is dead, but killed his mother, too. He claims he lost the horn while fighting her, and left Unferth's sword in her body to make sure that she stayed dead. Hrothgar gives Beowulf a quizzical look, and suddenly exclaims that since he, Hrothgar, has no heirs, everything he has, including the kingship and Wealthow, will go to Beowulf when he dies. Hrothgar throws another party, then asks Beowulf for a private word.\n\nThe King asks Beowulf to recount exactly what happened with Grendel's mother. Beowulf repeats the same blustery tale as before, but with a bit of wariness in his voice. The insinuation is that Beowulf isn't being truthful about what happened. When Beowulf refers to Grendel's mother as a hag, Hrothgar gives him a knowing gotcha! look and says Shes no hag, Beowulf. We both know that. But shes not my curse anymore; she's yours. Beowulf, realizing that the King knows exactly what happened, is visibly shaken, but says nothing. They rejoin the party, but Hrothgar excuses himself later and promptly jumps off the castle wall to his death. As Beowulf and Wealthow look down in horror, Unferth announces Beowulf as Denmark's new King.\n\nWe cut to Beowulf's face, older and grayer, wearing the Danish crown, surveying his soldiers on a field of battle. His soldiers are slaughtering the opposing army, and Beowulf seems almost saddened by the news. It seems that Grendel's mother made good on her promise, as Beowulf has enjoyed unsurpassed success and glory over the past 50 years, and Beowulf feels as his achievements are all empty and dishonorable, gained from an unholy union with a monster, rather than on Beowulf's own skill and merit. Beowulf even dares one of the enemy soldiers to try and kill him, knowing yet disappointed that it won't happen (it doesn't).\n\nWealthow is Beowulf's Queen, but he has taken up with a younger girl, Ursula (Alison Lohman), who truly seems to care for Beowulf. Their relationship is kept secret with the Queen, thought she knows about it anyway and doesn't say anything. In fact, Beowulf and Wealthow seem to be in a cold and loveless marriage, and she doesnt seem the least bit relieved or happy to learn that he came back from battle unharmed. When Ursula asks what happened in their marriage, Wealthow says \"Too many secrets.\" One would think that she is just as disgusted with Beowulf for having sex with Grendel's mother as she was with Hrothgar.\n\nOne night, Unferth comes to the King with a slave in tow. The slave holds out his hands to reveal Hrothgar's golden horn, which was found on the shore not too far from Grendel's cave. Beowulf is freaked out, as he realizes that this means that the deal with Grendel's mother is no longer in effect, and that trouble is sure to follow. Sure enough, one of the kingdoms outlying villages is attacked by a dragon one night, and almost all are killed. Unferth is spared so that he can pass on a message to the King that his son is waiting for him.\n\nBeowulf knows that this dragon must be the spawn of his liaison with Grendel's mother, and prepares to set out to fight him. He shares a tender moment with Wealthow where they admit that despite everything that's happened, they still love each other. Then he suits up with Wiglaf and they head out to the cave.\n\nAgain, Beowulf insists on going in alone. He hears a male voice trying to decide who it should kill first, the Queen or Ursula. Grendel's mother appears, who tells Beowulf it is too late to make amends, take things back or renegotiate the deal. As she says this, a huge dragon appears in the caves darkened alcove and spews a blast of fire toward Beowulf. He dodges and escapes the cave just as the dragon flies out and heads toward Heorot. Beowulf grabs onto the dragon and tries to fight it mid-flight. Wiglaf follows on his horse. At some point, Beowulf gets a chain of some kind lashed around the dragon's neck. When Beowulf is on the back of the dragon, it nose dives into the ocean and plunges deep to the seabed. Beowulf is violently thrown off its back but luckily chances upon an old anchor with a heavy chain, grabs hold of it and jams it in the mighty jaws of the dragon just as it was about to surface above out of the ocean.\n\nBeowulf isn't very successful in slowing up the dragon, and it starts to lay fiery siege to the castle's perimeter. As it just so happens, both Wealthow and Ursula are talking on the castles rampart as the dragon approaches, and it makes a beeline for them. The dragon burns both of the ramparts exits, leaving the women trapped and with no place to hide.\n\nBeowulf find himself dangling on the chain, swinging right in front of the dragons neck, where Beowulf spots a large glowing red area, just like the red jewel in Hrothgar's horn. Beowulf stabs the red area, to find that it opens up into the dragons throat and also happens to give Beowulf a clear shot at the dragons heart. However, Beowulf cant reach the heart. Try as he might, he's always a few inches too far away. Knowing its only a matter of time before the dragon burns the women, Beowulf takes his sword and chops off most or his arm holing the chain. He loses his sword, but the partial separation of his arm from his torso gives him the extra few inches needed to grab the heart and rip it out.\n\nAs Beowulf squeezes the heart until it bursts, the dragon starts to fall from the sky, down the cliffs of the castle, taking Beowulf with him it its death throes. Wiglaf arrives to save the women. At the shoreline at the bottom of the cliff, both Beowulf and the dragon are sprawled on the beach. The tide washes over them both, and Beowulf, barely conscious, sees the dead dragon melt away to reveal a human form, looking remarkably like a young Beowulf covered completely in Grendel's mother's golden film. The body is carried away by the tide just as Wiglaf arrives in search of the king.\n\nBeowulf knows hes about to die, and reveals that he made arrangements for Wiglaf to become the new king. He beseeches Wiglaf to let folks know that Beowulf never killed Grendel's mother (it seems Wiglaf might have always known the truth, but loyal lieutenant that he is, followed Beowulf's story anyway). Beowulf also asks that Wiglaf make up no other stories or inflate the truth in recounting what led up to the king's death. Finally at peace, Beowulf dies.\n\nHe is given a Viking-like funeral, placed on a boat with sword in hand, and surrounded by offerings to the gods. The boat is set on fire and set out to sea. Wealthow and Ursula, grieving together, head back to the castle, as does everyone else, but King Wiglaf stays behind to watch, himself grieving at the loss of his friend.\n\nAs he watches the ship engulfed by flames, he sees Grendel's mother appear still human and nude, but with demon wings and a serpent tail, descend onto the boat and give Beowulf a parting kiss. She descends into the water, and the boat then crumbles and sinks completely out of sight. Wiglaf seems to be unsurprised by her appearance.\n\nWhat he is surprised to see is Grendel's mother rising out of the water, much closer to the shore, looking straight at Wiglaf. And he looks down to see Hrothgar's horn wash upon the shore. He picks it up and takes a few steps into the surf, eyes fixed on Grendel's mother. She is looking at Wiglaf with the same sultry beckoning look that she gave Beowulf 50 years ago; Wiglaf seems just as transfixed as Beowulf was.\n\nAs the two gaze at each other, we are left to wonder whether Wiglaf resisted her, or if he gave in just as Hrothgar and Beowulf did, and thus started the cycle of the curse all over again.\n\nThe End"

    "Beowulf & Grendel": "[[Hrothgar]], king of Danelands, and a group of mounted and helmeted warriors chase a large and burly man, whom they consider a monstrous [[troll]], and his young son across a large open field until father and son find themselves on the edge of deep cliff overlooking a beach and a large sea. The father directs his young son, [[Grendel]], to climb down and hide from the attackers' view. The Danes shoot the father dead with their arrows and his dead body plunges down onto the beach far below. The Danish king walks towards the cliff edge and sees the young Grendel hanging but chooses to spare him.\n\nLater, Grendel is on the beach below and finds his father's body. After failing to move the large and heavy corpse, the boy takes a sword and cuts the head off to take it home.\n\nMany years later, the severed (and mummified) head is inside a cave where the boy Grendel has grown up to be as large and burly as his father. Grendel bloodies his own forehead with stones to express his vengeful anger towards the Danes and the beginning of his own murderous campaign of revenge.\n\nWhen Hrothgar finds twenty of his warriors killed inside his great hall, the Danish king falls into a depression. [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]], with the permission of [[Hygelac]], king of [[G\u00f6taland|Geatland]], sails to Daneland with thirteen Geats on a mission to slay Grendel for Hrothgar.\n\nThe arrival of Beowulf and his warriors is welcomed by Hrothgar, but the king's village has fallen into a deep despair and many of the pagan villagers convert to Christianity at the urging of an [[Irish monk]]. While Grendel does go into Hrothgar's village during the night, he flees rather than fight.\n\nBeowulf learns more about Grendel from Selma the witch and seer, who tells Beowulf that Grendel will not fight him because Beowulf has committed no wrong against him. A villager, recently baptized and thus now unafraid of death, leads Beowulf and his men to the cliff above Grendel's cave, but without a rope they are afraid to die descending to the cave itself, and turn back without even seeing the cave. When that villager is found broken and dead, Beowulf and his men return with a rope and gain entry to Grendel's secret cave. Grendel being absent, one of Beowulf's vengeful men mutilates the mummified head and shrine of Grendel's slain father.\n\nThat night, Grendel attacks Beowulf and his men while they sleep in Hrothgar's great hall, killing the Geat who desecrated his father's head and then, revenge satisfied, leaps out from the second story, but is caught in a trap by Beowulf, leaving Grendel hanging by his right arm. Grendel, refusing capture, escapes by hacking off his own arm. Grendel, bleeding severely, manages to reach the same beach where he had once found his father's slain corpse and wades into the water, where he dies, his body claimed by a mysterious webbed hand. Hrothgar admits to Beowulf that he had killed Grendel's father for stealing a fish but had spared the child-troll Grendel out of pity.\n\nThere is great celebration in the hall of Hrothgar, and the king's mood has been livened up by the defeat of Grendel, whose severed arm is kept by the Danes as a trophy.\n\nIn revealing more about Grendel's nature, Selma recounts how Grendel had once visited her hut and clumsily raped her and has protected her since that day, troubling Beowulf all the more. Yet that does not stop him from moving forward to kiss Selma, who deftly slaps him for tying her up earlier in the film, which he did in an attempt to get her to lead him to Grendel. Nevertheless, she then pulls his head forward and kisses him, quickly initiating and taking the lead in their lovemaking as she straddles him down on her bed.\n\nThe Danes are later attacked by [[Grendel's mother]], the Sea Hag. Beowulf finds her lair, where she placed Grendel's dead body along with a pile of treasure, and slays Grendel's mother with a sword from this pile. Beowulf realizes the battle has been watched by a strange young boy with red hair, who is Grendel and Selma's child.\n\nBeowulf, with Grendel's son watching from the shelter of the rocks, buries Grendel and builds him a marker, honouring him. Shortly thereafter, Beowulf and his band of Geats leave Daneland by ship but not before warning Selma that she must continue to hide her son, lest the Danes hunt him down as they did his father."

    "Best of the Best": "After Alex Grady (Eric Roberts), an automobile plant welder, teaches his five-year-old son, Walter (Edan Gross), to ride a bike, he opens a letter requesting he try out for the U.S. Olympic Tae Kwon Do team for the 1988 Summer Olympics in South Korea. He shows it to his mother (Louise Fletcher), who worries that due to an old shoulder injury he could become paralyzed if he competes.\n\nMeanwhile, Tommy Lee (Phillip Rhee) receives his invitation while he conducts a children's Tae Kwon Do class.\n\nAt the tryouts, Travis Brickley (Chris Penn), a stocky athlete in a cowboy hat, refuses to share his adhesive tape with Alex. Tommy tosses Alex a roll of tape as Frank Couzo (James Earl Jones), the U.S. head coach watches. As the competition gets under way, Travis approaches Virgil Keller (John Dye), another competitor, and warns him to watch his face. Another athlete, Sonny Grasso (David Agresta), theorizes that Travis' bad attitude comes from his mother never having breast fed him. They watch Travis argue with the referee during a match and lose the bout. As he walks away, coach Frank Couzo tells Don Peterson (Tom Everett), his assistant, that Travis is \"a fighter.\"\n\nAfter multiple matches, Couzo gives Mr. Jennings (John P. Ryan), the Olympic committee chairman, his list for the team. Although Jennings voices concern about Alex's shoulder, he announces that Alex, Sonny, Virgil, Tommy and Travis have made the team. Couzo takes the athletes into another room and reads them the rules, including never be late and act as a team. He explains they have three months to get ready for their first invitational bout against South Korea. They are shown to their living quarters and assigned roommates. Tommy is paired with Alex and discovers he is a widower. Across the hall, Don shows Sonny his computer discs containing statistics on every major Tae Kwon Do athlete in the world. In turn, Sonny shares his compact disc collection of rare opera performances.\n\nIn another room, Travis dolls up for a night out, frustrated by Virgil's meditating. With only one night before training begins, they go to a bar where Travis flirts with another man's woman, and a bar brawl erupts. Frank Couzo arrives, takes a seat at the bar and enjoys the action. When the patrons are all knocked unconscious, Couzo orders everyone back to the bus. The next day, over his protests, the team is assigned Catherine Wade (Sally Kirkland), a sports psychologist trained in the mystic arts of the east. She explains that Koreans have been trained since birth in meditation and focus and that without her help the U. S. can never defeat them.\n\nThe men are put through a brutal training regimen which includes yoga and meditation classes with Catherine. They learn that if there is a tie, a match will be decided by a show of strength, and are told to break five cement blocks with a karate chop. When no one volunteers to go first, Couzo picks Catherine to demonstrate. To everyone's surprise, she easily shatters every block. Travis maintains his surly attitude, making racist remarks to Tommy Lee and belittling Catherine's teaching.\n\nOne day, Travis challenges Tommy to a fight, and when Tommy refuses, he asks if he is \"yellow.\" Tommy responds \"obviously,\" and the room erupts in laughter. Later, the men watch video tapes of the Korean opponents they will be facing. Tommy learns he will be facing Korea's best, Dae Han Park. That night, Tommy dreams about being five years old and watching his older brother David compete against Dae Han in a tournament. Park kicks David in the head and kills him.\n\nThe next day, Tommy and Travis are sparring when Travis tries an illegal move. Tommy uses jujitsu to throw Travis to the mat. Couzo takes Tommy aside to show concern that he did not finish Travis, fearing that if Tommy holds back during the tournament, Dae Han will tear him apart. Three days before leaving for the Korea, Alex's son, Walter, is struck by a car. He tells Couzo he needs to go home, but the coach tells him if he leaves, he is off the team. Alex makes it home to find Walter is in a coma. The next day, Walter resumes consciousness, and Alex goes back to training camp, but Couzo refuses to let him back on the team.\n\nIn practice, Tommy kicks Virgil unconscious. Tommy flashes back to David's death and runs out of the building. He tells Alex he cannot fight Dae Han because he is afraid he will kill the man, but Alex explains that he is only destroying himself by holding in his anger. Tommy shrugs him off and rides away on his motorcycle.\n\nCatherine breaks into Couzo's office to read Tommy's file, then accuses the coach of only caring about winning. Couzo explains that he was David's coach, and the boy died because he did not prepare him for the fight. His only goal in life is to make sure that never happens again. Later, Travis, Virgil, and Sonny tell Couzo they need both Alex and Tommy to win. Couzo merely tells them to be on the flight in the morning, then asks Alex to come back.\n\nMeanwhile, Tommy stops for gas and sees a boy drop his ice cream cone. The boy's older brother gives him his cone, making Tommy smile. The next day, Tommy arrives at the airport and Couzo welcomes him back.\n\nWhen the team arrives in Seoul, South Korea, Couzo tells the team that if they give one hundred percent, win or lose, they will be the \"best of the best.\" Entering the arena, Alex sees his mother and Walter in the stands and thanks Couzo for getting them to the tournament. The contest begins with Sonny taking a brutal beating and losing his bout. Virgil also loses, giving the Koreans an eleven point lead. Travis takes the floor and receives a crushing blow to the head. Despite being blinded by his own blood, he battles on and ties the match.\n\nTo break the tie, the athletes each approach a pile of cement blocks. Travis smashes six, but his opponent breaks nine. Tommy takes Alex aside and tells him it is up to them to bring in the victory. Alex leaps ahead in his match, but his opponent lands a lucky blow and taunts him. Alex leaps on him and both teams rush the mats, but are constrained by their coaches and security personnel.\n\nIn the third round, the Korean dislocates Alex's shoulder with a flying kick. Couzo and Don beg Alex to forfeit, but knowing they will lose the contest, Alex orders Tommy to pop Alex's shoulder back into place. Catherine helps Alex go into a trance to control the pain, and he returns to the ring. With one hand tied to his side, Alex drop kicks the Korean out of the ring, winning the match.\n\nWith the score 29 for South Korea and 22 for the U.S.A., Tommy faces Dae Han Park. Dae Han quickly scores three times, but Tommy recovers and beats him to the floor. Dae Han illegally kicks Tommy in the groin as the first round ends. Needing six points or a knockout to win, Tommy enters the ring. Dae Han throws another illegal blow, but the referee does not see it. Tommy recovers and scores again and again until he breaks his opponent's leg. Tied, with only 30 seconds left in the match, Dae Han struggles to his feet. Tommy, preparing to finish the fight, flashes back to Dae Han killing his brother, and freezes, vibrating with rage. Fearing that Dae Han will not survive the attack, Alex, Couzo and the assistant coaches dissuade Tommy. The buzzer sounds, and Dae Han falls to the mat, but wins the contest. Couzo takes Tommy in his arms and tells him he really won the match.\n\nLater, as the Koreans receive their gold medals, a bloody Dae Han hobbles over to Tommy. He tells him that \"to save a life with defeat is to earn victory and honor,\" then places his medal around Tommy's neck. Apologizing for David's death, Dae Han offers himself as Tommy's brother. Alex's opponent walks over and presents him with his medal, also. The rest of the Korean team does likewise, and the crowd explodes into applause."

    "Best of the Best 2": "In this sequel to the first 'Best of the Best' film, U.S. Olympic karate champions Alex Grady (Eric Roberts), Tommy Lee (Philip Rhee), and Travis Brickley (Chris Penn) open a martial arts studio in Las Vegas, Nevada in the past four years since their debut in South Korea.\n\nA well-known fighter, Brakus (Ralf Moelle), arrives by helicopter at a nightclub on the Vegas strip, where he battles fighters in a secret arena known as the \"coliseum.\" As wealthy patrons look on, challengers battle their way through three \"no rules\" matches to face Brakus in a fight to the death, in which the victor is declared the new owner of the coliseum.\n\nThe night's fight begins with Travis Brickley emerging to face his first gladiator. Travis wins the round, and as he celebrates in a private lounge, he is congratulated by announcer Weldon Dardano (Wayne Newton). When Brakus enters, Travis threatens the undefeated champ.\n\nElsewhere, Alex Grady takes his son, Walter Grady (Edan Gross), on a camping trip, along with Tommy Lee. Eleven-year-old Walter practices his karate moves by the campfire, in hope of attaining a black belt in an upcoming tryout. However, at the tryout, Walter fails to break a brick with his hand, and is denied the certification.\n\nAlex, Tommy, and Travis take Walter and the rest of the studio's young team to a Vegas strip restaurant to celebrate, and Alex's girlfriend, television sports reporter Sue MacCauley (Meg Foster), also attends. Alex gives a speech telling Walter how proud he is of the way he handled the disappointment, and notes that things have not been easy for the boy since his mother's death several years earlier.\n\nLater, as Alex gets ready to leave their apartment for the evening, Walter confesses that he canceled his babysitter, Martha, because he is old enough to look after himself. Alex replies that Travis will be stopping by to drop something off before going to his bowling league, and Walter should go with him. When Travis arrives, he tells Walter he is not going bowling after all, but the boy convinces Travis to take him along. Travis confides that he is fighting at the coliseum, and Alex and Tommy would be upset if they knew, so Walter blackmails Travis into sneaking him inside the coliseum. The boy watches from the rafters as Brakus beats Travis in the \"no rules\" battle. As the boy looks on, the crowd votes whether Travis should live or die. Walter screams as Brakus snaps Travis's neck, killing him. Horrified, Walter flees and runs home to tell his father and Tommy what happened.\n\nWhen Alex and Tommy visit the coliseum to search for their friend, Weldon Dardano claims that after Travis took a beating, he got up and left with a woman. Despite Walter's claim that Weldon is lying, Alex and Tommy continue searching for Travis. Later, Travis Brickley's body is discovered floating in the river, and Alex and Tommy vow revenge. They bust in on Weldon and Brakus, demanding to know the identity of their friend's killer. When Alex asks Brakus if he killed Travis, Brakus says he did so \"easily,\" and beats up Alex. Tommy fights Brakus next, and throws him into a mirror, inciting the man's fury. Weldon stops the fight, and security arrives to escort the two martial artists out of the club. Brakus vows privately to kidnap Tommy, and kill Alex and Walter.\n\nWhen Tae Kwon Doe champion Dae Han attends Travis Brickley's funeral, he offers to help avenge his killing. Later, Alex visits Sue MacCauley at her television station and asks her to announce that Brakus killed Travis, but she insists that she cannot broadcast such an unfounded proclamation. Alex insults her for not taking Walter's word, and leaves in anger.\n\nLater, as Walter rides his bicycle, Brakus's henchmen follow him home and fire shots into the house. Alex and Tommy fight their attackers, and afterward, leave town to seek shelter at the desert home of Tommy's Native American grandmother. When they arrive, Grandma suggests that her son, James, help them. However, Tommy Lee holds a long-standing grudge against his uncle, and the two engage in a fistfight on the front lawn. Later, Tommy tells Alex that Uncle James ran off with Grandma's money and won several fighting tournaments in Europe, before a near-fatal automobile accident ended his career.\n\nAlex and Tommy set up a gym in a barn to resume their training. Meanwhile, Grandma chastises James for his drunken antics, and demands that he help Tommy, or move out.\n\nThe next day, James informs Tommy he knows how Brakus fights. Tommy dismisses his uncle until James reveals scars on his stomach, and confesses he got them from Brakus, not from an automobile accident. Tommy and Alex accept James's offer and begin their rigorous training. James takes them to a sweat lodge, where they experience visions.\n\nLater, Brakus's gunmen arrive by helicopter, and hold everyone at gunpoint. When James shoots at the attackers, they kill him. As Tommy is flown away, the thugs douse the house with gasoline, preparing to burn Alex and Walter alive. However, the father and son escape before the house explodes. Watching from the helicopter above, Tommy believes his friends and family have been killed. Alex, Walter, and Grandma emerge, unharmed, from a trapdoor, and Alex apologizes to her for her house's devastation.\n\nAlex and Walter drive back to Las Vegas, as Brakus confronts Tommy, demanding they face off in the coliseum. Weldon introduces Tommy Lee to the crowd, and it cheers when Tommy easily defeats his first opponent. Returning for a second battle, he beats his challenger just as quickly. In his third fight, Tommy faces a gladiator he recognizes as the man who murdered Uncle James. Tommy takes a few hits before beating the man nearly to death. Brakus announces to the audience that Tommy has earned the right to challenge him in a fight to the death.\n\nMeanwhile, Alex and Walter arrive at Sue MacCauley's home, and Alex asks her to look after his son. Worried that his father will not return, Walter gives him an Indian feather he received from Tommy's grandmother for strength. When Sue apologizes for disappointing Alex, he kisses her and promises to soon return. Back at the coliseum, Tommy meditates as part of his preparation to fight Brakus. Dae Han secretly arrives at the nightclub after Alex asked for his help.\n\nAs Tommy and Brakus enter the ring and begin their battle, Alex and Dae Han fight security guards and get inside the coliseum. The battle in the ring intensifies, and the fighters are presented with metal pipes as weapons. When Alex breaks a glass wall to gain entry, Tommy's strength is renewed, and he knocks Brakus to the ground, warning him to stay down and accept his defeat. However, when Tommy turns his back on the gladiator, Brakus makes a final lunge. Tommy snaps his foe's neck, and looks stunned as he is declared the new owner of the coliseum. Alex joins his friend onstage, as Weldon Dardano gives the new champion the microphone. To Weldon's dismay, Tommy declares that the coliseum is closed."

    "Beverly Hills Cop": "Reckless but talented Detroit policeman Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) conducts an unauthorized sting operation, using a truck full of cigarettes (seized by the police as evidence in another case) to attempt to bust two hustlers (Frank Pesce and Gene Borkan). The 'deal' is interrupted by two patrolmen, resulting in one criminal fleeing on foot and the other escaping in the truck, with Axel trapped in the back. After an extensive chase, causing widespread damage, the truck crashes and the other man runs off, leaving Axel empty-handed. At the police station, he is severely reprimanded by his ill-tempered boss, Inspector Todd (Gilbert R. Hill), who informs Axel that if he conducts any further unapproved operations, he will be fired and brought up on charges.\n\nAxel goes home to find his ex-con best friend Mikey Tandino (James Russo) in his apartment, fresh from a job he got in Beverly Hills working for their mutual childhood friend, Jenny Summers. Mikey shows off some German bearer bonds he \"borrowed\" from his employers, which momentarily concerns Axel, but he is more interested in catching up with his old friend. After a night of drinking, Axel and Mikey return home and are accosted outside Axel's apartment by a burly man Mikey recognizes as Zack (Jonathan Banks). Zack knocks Axel unconscious before he sees anything. He then confronts Mikey about the bearer bonds, then shoots him twice in the head. After the police respond, Axel asks Inspector Todd to be let in on the case, but Todd flatly refuses. Deciding to secretly root around from a different angle, Axel asks for and is granted two weeks' vacation time.\n\nAxel then drives his \"crappy blue Chevy Nova\" all the way to Beverly Hills, California and, masquerading as a reporter for magazine, manages to check into a suite at the high-end Beverly Palm Hotel. He then meets up with his old friend Jenny (Lisa Eilbacher), who tells Axel that she (and Mikey) work for international-British-born art dealer Victor Maitland (Steven Berkoff). Axel finagles his way into Maitland's office, where Zack is revealed (to the viewers) to be the art dealer's right-hand man. Axel presses Maitland for answers about Mikey, but Maitland has his bodyguards throw Axel out - literally through a glass window on the main floor.\n\nOutside, Axel is confronted by the Beverly Hills police over a report of disturbing the peace. Finding his gun, they arrest him for possessing a concealed weapon, as he cannot afford to identify himself as a police officer. At the police station, he is questioned by Sergeant John Taggart (John Ashton) and Detective Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold). Taggart takes issue with Axel's irreverence and punches him in the stomach. Lieutenant Andrew Bogomil (Ronny Cox) steps in to reprimand Taggart and presses Axel further, adding that he has spoken to Inspector Todd back in Detroit, who hints that Axel will be fired if he finds out that Axel is investigating Mikey's death.\n\nJenny bails Axel out, and takes him back to the hotel, tailed all the while by Taggart and Rosewood, who have been assigned to watch him. As the detectives watch and wait across the street from the hotel in an unmarked car, Axel places a late supper order with room service to be delivered to them. He then coaxes a waiter to give him some bananas from a party tray, which he stuffs into the unmarked car's tailpipe while Rosewood and Taggart are distracted by the room service waiter. When Jenny and Axel leave the hotel, Taggart and Rosewood try to pursue, but their vehicle stalls, thanks to the bananas in the tailpipe.\n\nAxel and Jenny sneak into one of Maitland's warehouses, where they observe two of his men removing bearer bonds from a crate. Axel also discovers some coffee grounds around some of the crates. Axel then has Jenny follow the two men to a loading dock, where he sneaks in alone, noticing that the crate that formerly contained bearer bonds is placed among other crates waiting to be processed. When he crosses paths with a security guard, Axel passes himself off as a Customs inspector, demanding to see the records for all the crates in the warehouse.\n\nWhen Axel returns to the hotel, he spots Taggart and Rosewood still sitting in the unmarked car, waiting for him. Axel sneaks into the car, startling both men, who are irritable because they lost two days pay over his antics. Axel offers a truce of sorts, by letting them escort him to \"someplace classy.\" \"Someplace classy\" turns out to be a stripper bar. While there, Axel notices two men entering the club wearing trench coats. Immediately suspicious because it is June (too hot for coats) he deduces that the men intend to rob the place. Axel's suspicions prove true, and the men produce shotguns from under their coats. Axel and Taggart successfully disarm the would-be robbers, leading to a new sense of respect between them. Later, Axel lies to Bogomil that Taggart and Rosewood had tailed him to the strip club and that they deserve all the credit for the collar, but Taggart and Rosewood admit to Bogomil that they had accepted Axel's invitation to the establishment and that Axel had initiated the take-down. Though thankful that Axel had prevented the robbery, Bogomil is fed up with Rosewood and Taggart's seeming incompetence and assigns two other detectives, Foster (Art Kimbro) and McCabe (Joel Bailey) to tail Axel. Axel gently reprimands Taggart and Rosewood before he leaves, pointing out the lie he told about their actions was working.\n\nThe next day, Foster and McCabe catch up to Axel, who is loitering outside Maitland's gated mansion. When Maitland's car emerges from the compound, Axel jumps into his Nova and follows, with the detectives on his tail. Axel artfully loses Foster and McCabe and follows Maitland to a high class country club. He cons the maitre d' into letting him into the banquet hall, where he directly accuses Maitland of killing Mikey. Zack grabs Axel, who counter-throws him into the buffet, which brings the police to the venue. Axel is arrested again.\n\nAt the police station, Bogomil demands answers, which Axel finally gives at what he knows; Maitland is smuggling bearer bonds into the country and he had Mikey killed because he stole some of the bonds. Axel also accuses Maitland of trafficking drugs, thanks to the coffee grounds that Axel found in the warehouse; Bogomil acknowledges that drug traffickers sometimes pack cocaine in piles of coffee grounds to throw off drug-sniffing dogs. Bogomil finally sympathizes with Axel, and is intrigued by the theories he presents, but admits that he cannot arrest Maitland on pure speculation. To make matters worse, the no-nonsense Police Chief Hubbard (Stephen Elliott) has ordered Axel to leave Beverly Hills, having heard of his numerous indiscretions throughout the city. Bogomil, under orders from Hubbard, tells Rosewood to escort Axel to the city limits.\n\nAxel mentions to Rosewood that Maitland has another shipment due, which he decided not to tell Bogomil once he realized Bogomil couldn't or wouldn't help. Rosewood takes him to see Jenny at the art gallery, where Axel asks for her warehouse key, but she insists on coming along. Rosewood waits in the unmarked car, not being able to go in until Axel and Jenny establish the presence of evidence, otherwise it would be an illegal search. Sneaking into the warehouse, Axel opens a crate that turns out to contain large bags of cocaine hidden inside coffee grounds. Suddenly, Zack and his men appear and take Axel and Jenny at gunpoint. Outside, Rosewood watches helplessly as Maitland and more of his men enter the warehouse. Axel and Maitland exchange words, and Zack admits to Axel that he killed Mikey. Maitland and Zack then leave with Jenny as their hostage, leaving Axel to the mercy of their men. Rosewood finally decides to enter the warehouse and helps Axel to escape. On their way to Maitland's mansion, Rosewood contacts Taggart, telling him about the drugs in the warehouse and to not tell Bogomil about anything. Taggart tells Foster and McCabe to check out the warehouse, then rushes to meet up with Axel and Rosewood.\n\nAxel, Rosewood and a reluctant Taggart sneak in to the mansion's grounds, but are soon pinned down by gunfire from Maitland's men. Back at the station, Bogomil is puzzled by the absence of the four detectives, then hears about a call of shots fired. When he discovers that the address is Maitland's, Bogomil calls for all cars to descend on the mansion.\n\nAt the mansion, the police temporarily gain the upper hand, shooting down several gunmen. Axel tells Rosewood and Taggart to cover him as he enters the mansion. Inside, Zack has his weapon drawn and is hunting Axel. The cat-and-mouse game ends with Axel shooting Zack dead. Savoring his victory for a moment, Axel takes a large caliber bullet in his arm, courtesy of Maitland. Bogomil and a fleet of police officers arrive at the compound and arrest Maitland's surveillance and security teams. Inside the mansion, Axel confronts Maitland, who is holding his gun to Jenny's head. Neither man moves, until Bogomil appears behind Axel with his gun pointed at Maitland. Jenny takes advantage of this distraction to escape from Maitland, and Axel and Bogomil empty their guns into Maitland, killing him.\n\nWhen the smoke clears, Hubbard shows up, demanding answers. Bogomil makes up a story, insisting that he himself had led the investigation into Maitland's activities, thanks to Jenny and Axel's tips, and that Axel was merely an observer at the scene. Skeptical, Hubbard asks Taggart to confirm the story, which he does, having learned his lesson from the strip club incident. Finally, Hubbard decides to accept Bogomil's version of the events. Axel begs Bogomil to talk to Todd in Detroit, saying that if he lost his job in Detroit, he would move to Beverly Hills permanently and work as a private detective. Bogomil promises to clear everything up.\n\nThat evening, Axel prepares to check out of the Beverly Palm when Rosewood and Taggart arrive. They tell him that Bogomil insisted that they personally escort him to the city limits. When Axel's tab is produced, Taggart informs the desk clerk that the Beverly Hills Police Department will pick it up. Axel is moved by the gesture and \"gives\" each detective a hotel bathrobe (also paid for by the police department). Once outside, Axel offers to share a drink with his new friends; Taggart, who originally touted doing things \"by the book,\" decides that one drink \"won't kill us\" and he and Rosewood follow Axel, who says that they will be going to \"the perfect place; you guys'll love it. Trust me.\""

    "Beverly Hills Cop II": "Set approximately two years after the original film, Beverly Hills Police Captain (formerly Lieutenant) Andrew Bogomil (Ronny Cox), Detective Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold), and Sergeant John Taggart (John Ashton) are trying to figure out who is behind the \"Alphabet Crimes,\" a series of mostly high end store robberies distinguished by their monogrammed envelopes with an alphabetical sequence the assailants leave behind. Complicating matters is the new \"political\" state of the Beverly Hills police, headed by an incompetent and verbally abusive new police chief Harold Lutz (Allen Garfield), who is doing everything he can to stay on Mayor Ted Egan's (Robert Ridgely) good side. Unimpressed when Rosewood calls the FBI to help solve the case, Lutz holds Bogomil responsible as commanding officer and suspends him, despite Bogomil's efforts to convince him that Rosewood was only following a hunch, a traditional aspect of police work. Lutz also punishes Taggart and Rosewood by placing them on traffic duty.\n\nOn the way home, Bogomil is shot by Karla Fry (Brigitte Nielsen), the chief hench-woman of Maxwell Dent (J\u00fcrgen Prochnow). Finding out about the shooting over a news report, Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) immediately flies out to Beverly Hills (covering his absence from his actual job in Detroit by telling his commanding officer Inspector Todd he was going \"deep deep deep DEEP undercover\" on the credit card fraud case he had been assigned to) to help find out who shot Bogomil to repay the favor he owes Bogomil for saving his job two years ago. Before leaving town, Axel asks his co-worker Jeffrey Friedman (Paul Reiser) to drive his red Ferrari convertable around town to make it appear that Axel is still in the city.\n\nBefore leaving, Axel meets with his credit card fraud contact Vinnie (Robert Pastorelli) to stall the deal only to discover that Vinnie's front man is the same front man (Robert Pesce) that Axel did business while undercover before two years earlier during the cigarette heist deal. Axel accuses the man of being a cop and leaves for California.\n\nAfter arriving in L.A. by plane, Foley shacks up in a Beverly Hills mansion which is under construction while the owners are on vacation and sets it as his base of operations. Foley then goes to the police station and makes contact with Taggart and Rosewood who secretly agree to assist Foley because of Lutz's apparent attempts to find an excuse to get them fired. Posing as an undercover FBI agent to get past Lutz (by convincing Friedman in Detroit to pose as Todd to intercept Lutz's phone call to Todd's office and convince Lutz that Foley is part of a multi-jurisdictional task force). Foley soon starts making the connection between the robberies and Dent. Foley then asks Bogomil's teenage daughter, Jan (Alice Adair), to use her connections as an insurance agent to find out about Dent's financial dealings.\n\nIt turns out that Dent is robbing his own businesses deliberately (which have insurance) to finance firearms deals and is discreetly using his henchman Charles Cain (Dean Stockwell) as the front man for his operations. Bogomil was shot because he was on the right track with his investigation into the case.\n\nHaving foiled a robbery attempt at a bank depository, Foley is able to trick Dent's accountant Sydney Bernstein (Gilbert Gottfried) into using his computer and discovers that Dent and Karla are planning to leave the country, and he also learns from Jan that all of Dent's businesses have gone under except his race track, which he is convinced is the next target.\n\nOn the way to the race track, Foley solves the latest riddle sent to the police, and is convinced that this riddle was made easily solvable for the cops so Dent could implicate Cain as the Alphabet Bandit (though Foley is aware that Cain is being used as a patsy to throw the authorities off of Dent's trail as he not intelligent enough to be the Alphabet Bandit, having met him personally at Dent's gun club and getting an impression that he is a pawn instead of a criminal mastermind).\n\nThe three arrive too late to stop the robbery and find Cain's body (he was shot by Karla) among those killed. While Lutz announces publicly that the Alphabet Crimes have been solved, Foley notices some red mud at the stables, which leads him, Taggart and Rosewood to Dent's oil field where Dent is making his final arms deal. The three of them then engage in a shootout with everyone involved in the deal. Dent confronts Foley in the warehouse, but Foley gets distracted by one of Dent's men on the roof and Dent walks into the shadows. Dent then crashes through the wall in his car and Foley shoots Dent through the windshield, sending his car down a hill and erupting in flames, but not before running Foley over. Karla appears and is about to kill Foley, but is shot dead by Taggart.\n\nJust as the last thugs are about to flee, the police arrive upon the scene, along with Lutz and Mayor Egan. Lutz tries to fire Rosewood and Taggart for their insubordination and also attempts to arrest Foley. However, both Taggart and Rosewood stand up to Lutz this time and prove that Dent was the real Alphabet Bandit and that the real purpose of the Alphabet Crimes was about financing the arms deal (so Dent could make a larger profit overseas). They are also able to convince Mayor Egan of Lutz's incompetence (since Lutz would had gotten in the way had he known about their activities due to him intentionally ignoring the truth from other cops), and the Mayor personally fires Lutz because he is tired of his abusive attitude towards his own men and for jeopardizing the investigation.\n\nAt the end, Bogomil is chosen by Mayor Egan to replace Lutz as the next Chief of Police, and Foley returns back to Detroit, but not before he gets chewed out by Inspector Todd over the phone, right after Egan called him to congratulate him on allowing Foley to assist them on this case. On top of that, Jeffrey Friedman is revealed to have accidentally wrecked Foley's car while covering for him.\n\nIn the final scene, Rosewood and Taggart say their goodbye to Foley for good when the owners of the Beverly Hills mansion return from their vacation to find Foley and the two detectives there, forcing Foley to flee to the airport and leaving Rosewood and Taggart to explain to the owners what they are doing in their house."

    "Beverly Hills Cop III": "One night in Detroit, Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) plans to arrest a gang of car thieves who run a local chop shop. Unbeknownst to his boss, Inspector G. Douglas Todd (Gil Hill), Axel has canceled the SWAT, intending to raid the shop using only his team. Meanwhile, a group of men arrive at the chop shop to pick up a cube van that the car thieves had hijacked. The leader of the group confirms that the vehicle still contains its cargo, which consists of crates labelled as property of the U.S. government, then has his men execute the car thieves.\n\nAs the murderers are about to leave, Axel, unaware of what has happened inside, proceeds with his plan to enter the shop and quickly finds his team outgunned. Todd, arriving moments later, is fatally shot by the group's leader. As the perpetrators escapes in the cube van, an angry Foley gives chase in one of the partially disassembled cars from the shop, but is prevented from continuing the chase by Secret Service Agent Steve Fulbright (Stephen McHattie). Fulbright informs Axel that the killer must remain on the loose because the federal government is pursuing a larger scheme in which he is involved.\n\nAfter Todd's funeral, Axel learns that several clues left behind by the killers point to Wonder World, a theme park in Beverly Hills, California owned by \"Uncle\" Dave Thorton (Alan Young). Axel arrives in Beverly Hills and reunites with his friend Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold), who has been promoted to \"Deputy Director of Operations for Joint Systems Interdepartmental Operational Command\" (DDO-JSIOC), and meets Billy's new partner, Jon Flint (H\u00e9ctor Elizondo). It is revealed that John Taggart is now retired and is living in Phoenix, Arizona. Axel asks Flint to call his friend Ellis DeWald (Timothy Carhart), the head of Wonder World's park security, to let him know that he's coming to the park for his investigation.\n\nAxel meets and befriends Janice Perkins (Theresa Randle) whilst touring the park's behind-the-scenes facilities. Later, he is spotted by security, shot at and attacked hand-to-hand. Foley retreats to the surface where he cuts in line to enter the Spider Ferris wheel ride. The guards accidentally jam the ride, placing two little kids' lives in danger. Axel rescues them and is subsequently taken to park manager Orrin Sanderson (John Saxon). When DeWald is called in to contest the claim that Axel was attacked by the security men without prior challenge, Axel immediately recognizes DeWald as Todd's killer, but Rosewood and Flint refuse to believe that claim because DeWald is keeping an impeccable public reputation.\n\nHowever, Axel is later visited by Uncle Dave and Janice, who inform him that the Wonder World park's designer and Dave's close friend, Roger Fry, has mysteriously disappeared while inspecting the grounds two weeks ago, leaving only a letter with a cryptic message. He tries to heckle DeWald into revealing his criminal involvements, despite continued admonishments by Agent Fulbright, but DeWald proves too smooth to be caught in a mistake. When Axel later digs deeper into a closed-off section of the park, he finds out that DeWald and Sanderson run a counterfeiting ring that uses Wonder World as a front, and DeWald was at the chop shop in Detroit to get his hands on blank printing paper used for American currency. Axel later meets with Uncle Dave to ask him about further details to find a piece of viable evidence, and thereby discovers that Fry's warning letter is actually written on a sheet of the stolen mint paper. Before he can make use of that evidence, however, Uncle Dave is shot by DeWald, and Axel is framed for his shooting.\n\nAfter getting away from DeWald and bringing Uncle Dave to the next hospital, Axel sets out to prove his innocence by storming the park, calling Rosewood and Flint to assist him. The resulting shootout kills DeWald's henchmen, and after a hand-to-hand fight Axel shoots and kills DeWald. Agent Fulbright appears to explain that he was wrong, but Axel realizes his actual involvement with the counterfeiter and shoots him during a brief struggle. Uncle Dave makes a full recovery, and he thanks Axel for his assistance by creating a new character for Wonder World in his honor, Axel Fox."

    "Beverly Hills Ninja": "A clan of ninjas finds an abandoned treasure chest that had been washed onto shore, inside of which was a white infant boy. An ancient legend spoke of a foreigner who would come among the ninja and become a master like no other. The white orphan boy, Haru (Chris Farley), is raised among the ninja, with the expectation that he may be the one of whom the legend speaks. As Haru grows into adulthood, doubts are quickly cast over him for being the great white ninja. Although he does possess some ninja traits, Haru is clumsy and does not really fit in, and fails to graduate a ninja with the rest of his class. Left alone to protect the temple while the clan are on a mission, Haru disguises himself as a ninja when a blonde American woman who comes to seek the services of one. The woman, Sally Jones (Nicollette Sheridan), is suspicious of her boyfriend, Martin Tanley (Nathaniel Parker), and sends Haru to a Tokyo harbor to investigate.\n\nHaru finds out that Tanley and his staff, Nobu (Keith Cooke Hirabayashi) are involved in a counterfeiting business and also witnesses a murder. The clan are disappointed with Haru's actions when Tokyo police presume that Haru is responsible for the murder. However, Haru admits that Sally was in trouble, despite her name is a pseudonym. Haru departs from Tokyo to Beverly Hills to search for Sally. Gobei (Robin Shou), Haru's adoptive brother and the best ninja in his class at the beginning of the film, is sent by the clan to watch over and protect Haru.\n\nHaru has trouble adjusting to Western culture, but checks in at a Beverly Hills five-star hotel, where he befriends an employee, Joey Washington (Chris Rock), and teaches him some ninja lessons. Haru sets out on his search for Sally, convinced that she is in trouble. Haru eventually finds Sally, but she distances herself from him. Haru tracks Tanley and Nobu to a night club in Little Tokyo, where they are trying to get back a set of counterfeiting plates from their rival gang. Unfortunately, Haru finds himself as the suspect of a second murder. He return to the hotel the next day and meditates to communicate with his Sensei (Soon-Tek Oh) for guidance. Haru resumes his quest, and tracks down Tanley's mansion. Upon entering Tanley's mansion, Haru speaks with Sally, whose real name is Allison Page. He eventually begins to trust her again, and Allison tells Haru that she accused Tanley for killing her sister.\n\nThat night, Haru and Allison escape a gun-fight at a Japanese restaurant, where Tanley and his henchmen sees Allison there. Haru and Allison have their retreat at the hotel for the night. The next day, Haru disguises himself as ink specialist Chet Walters (William Sasso) and Tanley takes him to his warehouse, where Tanley soon finds out that Haru is \"the fat ninja that everyone is talking about\". While Tanley is in the process of getting the other half of the plates that night, Allison rescues Haru from the back of Tanley's van. However, Tanley kidnaps Allison during the process, and Haru must find his way back to Tanley's warehouse to rescue Allison, but since he was blindfolded during his first trip, Haru must recreate his ride by memory and enlists his help of Joey and without knowing that Gobei is also hiding in the trunk. After Joey accidentally drives the convertible through a horse race and a car wash, he and Haru start over. Gobei gets out of the trunk after Haru is blindfolded, knocks Joey out, and drives the convertible to Tanley's warehouse. Haru uses the momentum of a large palm tree to jump into Tanley's warehouse, while Gobei also makes it in by using stealthier methods.\n\nHaru and Gobei fight Tanley's henchmen until Haru is reminded that he should be rescuing Allison. Using a forklift, Haru smashes two holes in the wall of the room where Tanley takes Allison hostage, almost setting off the bomb. Haru attempts to defuse the bomb, but accidentally resets it for five minutes. Haru leaves Allison for four minutes to help Gobei, who is surrounded by Tanley's henchmen. Haru jumps off the railing and eventually lands on an ax-wielding henchman who attempts to kill Gobei and suddenly becomes an adept ninja when Gobei gets hurt by Nobu and his henchmen. Haru and Gobei defeat one henchman with their little help from Joey, who jumps into Tanley's warehouse and eventually lands on one of them. Haru and Gobei has two minutes to defeat Tanley, who has a gun. Haru cuts the rope of a winch to aim for Tanley, but the hook accidentally knocks out Gobei instead.\n\nBlocking Tanley's bullets by swinging his two swords, Haru eventually incapacitates Tanley. He return to the upper level to rescue Allison. Using a huge harpoon gun mounted on a cart, Haru shoots a harpoon through the room and inadvertently lands in the back of a truck where Tanley attempt to escape from his warehouse. After capturing the bomb, the cart lands in Tanley's truck and explodes seconds later. Haru successfully rescues Allison, and Tanley and his surviving henchmen are arrested.\n\nIn the film's conclusion, Haru talks to his Sensei about returning to Beverly Hills, where they do not have ninjas there. Haru and Allison later ride on the bus, which accidentally drags a rope tied into Gobei's wheelchair. Haru shouts an apology to Gobei, who is thrown into the ocean."

    "Beyond Skyline": "Taking place at the same time as Skyline, Mark Corley, a Los Angeles police detective, helps his estranged son, Trent, out of jail just as an alien invasion begins. The entire population of the city is sucked into various spaceships by a blue light. Mark leads a group of surviving humans through underground subway tunnels to escape, though most of the humans are killed or abducted, one by one. The survivors - Mark, Trent, transit operator Audrey, and a homeless man known only as \"Sarge\", who is immune to the blue light due to his blindness - escape to the marina following the city's nuclear destruction, only to be abducted into the alien flagship by a towering alien tanker.\n\nOn board the spaceship, Mark tries to find his son and storms his way into various chambers, where he meets up with survivor Elaine and her transformed husband Jarrod (from the first film). Elaine explains that Jarrod retained control of his mind despite being transformed into a bio-mechanical alien soldier. Though Elaine is three months pregnant, her pregnancy has accelerated and she gives birth to a daughter.\n\nElaine dies during the delivery, and Mark and Jarrod team up to destroy the alien ship by setting alien explosives inside the ship's control systems. When Jarrod is killed fighting the alien leader, Mark rescues Audrey but is too late to save his son.\n\nTrent has his brain taken and placed in another alien bio-mechanical machine creature. Sarge is badly wounded when he defends the baby from an alien. The dying Jarrod destroys the ship, which crashes in rural Laos.\n\nMark, Audrey, Sarge and the baby escape from the spaceship which starts to repair itself. Sarge dies from his wounds shortly after the group meets Sua and his sister Kanya, who belong to a drug cartel and fight against both aliens and local rogue ex-policemen bandits.\n\nAs they trek through the jungle, the group discovers that the human baby grows at an accelerated rate, from an infant into a three-year-old in just one day. Sua and Kanya lead Mark, Audrey, and the baby to a hidden human resistance hideout and drug processing facility located in local ruins. In addition, the leader of the rogue policemen Huana intercepts them but is disarmed and captured by Sua.\n\nHarper, a medical officer and former drug chemist, examines the baby girl and learns about her unique DNA. Harper believes her blood may be the key to defeating the aliens due to her evolving DNA. Using the child's blood and recovered alien technology, Harper develops a serum he believes will free the bio-mechanical soldiers from alien control and restore their human personality. Though Sua insists on killing all the bio-mechanical soldiers, Mark convinces Sua to allow him to save Trent.\n\nWhile on a patrol, Kanya encounters a four-legged tanker alien and sacrifices herself by luring it into an old minefield left over from the Vietnam war. Though she destroys it, she unwittingly gives away their location to the alien ships searching for the human newborn child. They converge on the human base.\n\nDuring the resulting battle between the aliens and the humans several members of the human resistance are killed, including Harper. Mark enters a grounded alien ship where he uses Harper's serum to turn the mind-controlling blue light into a red light that frees the mind-controlled bio-mechanical soldiers. Before he can deploy it, the alien leader and his horde of alien warriors attacks the human resistance and rips out the cannon containing the light. Sua frees a jailed Huana on the condition he fights for the resistance. Mark, Audrey, Sua and Huana then make a last stand to fight back the aliens. Though the four fight off hoards of aliens, Huana loses two arms and a leg during the fight.\n\nTrent, his mind restored after encountering his father, fights back inside a giant alien tanker. While the alien leader is busy fighting Trent, the child fixes the cannon which Trent uses to kill the alien leader and release the red light freeing the bio-mechanical soldiers. With Earth saved, Audrey names the girl Rose after Mark's deceased wife.\n\nTen years later, Rose, now a fully-grown adult, has taken control of an alien ship, and alien Trent is her second-in-command and adoptive brother. Rose leads freed bio-mechanical soldiers and humans in an assault on the other alien ships around the Moon, including the mothership.\n\n(copied from Wikipedia)"

    "Beyond the Poseidon Adventure": "The film continues the story from the original movie's conclusion. The Poseidon is still afloat, and the six survivors of Reverend Scott's team have been rescued. After sailing through rough seas, a tugboat captain, Mike Turner (Michael Caine), discovers the capsized wreck of the ship. Accompanied by second mate Wilbur (Karl Malden) and passenger Celeste Whitman (Sally Field), he heads out to claim salvage rights on it, as the tugboat 'S.S. Jenny' lost her cargo in the same storm that capsized it.\n\nThey are soon followed by Dr. Stefan Svevo (Telly Savalas) and his crew; Kurt (Paul Picerni), Doyle (Patrick Culliton), and Castrop (Dean Raphael Ferrandini) who claim to be Greek Orthodox medics who received the ship's SOS. The seven of them board the doomed vessel and soon become trapped after the corridor entrance to the cut-out hole collapses. The group with Turner also encounters more survivors; the ship's nurse, Gina Rowe (Shirley Jones), a wealthy passenger named Suzanne Constantine (Veronica Hamel), and war veteran Frank Mezzetti (Peter Boyle) who is searching for his missing teenage daughter Theresa (Angela Cartwright), which they soon find along with the elevator operator Larry Simpson (Mark Harmon) and as well as a brash \"billionaire\" named \"Tex\" (Slim Pickens). Later they find two more surviving passengers; the blind retiree Harold Meredith (Jack Warden) and his wife Hannah (Shirley Knight), who were waiting for rescue.\n\nWater continues to submerge more decks and more explosions occur. Turner and his group find the purser's office, where Svevo decides that he and his men will continue their search for other survivors. Turner agrees and Svevo and his men leave in another direction. Another explosion causes the safe in the purser's office to fall through the floor and open, revealing gold coins (each one worth 100 times its weight in gold) as well as cash and diamonds. Turner and Wilbur excitedly gather it and start looking for another way out of the ship.\n\nUnknown to Turner and the survivors, Suzanne was actually working with Svevo and sneaked a list containing information about a cargo of crates from the purser's office. She gives it to Svevo, but decides that she doesn't want to go through with his plan anymore. Svevo apologizes and orders Doyle to kill Suzanne. He shoots her, but she strikes him with an axe before she dies.\n\nAfter climbing up a few decks, Turner and his group find Svevo and his men gathering a cargo of plutonium. Svevo reveals that his real intention of boarding the Poseidon was to retrieve his lost shipment of plutonium to sell on the black market, adding that he can't let Turner and his group go now. However, before they can kill Turner and his group, another explosion occurs, allowing them to escape through another cargo room full of cars, where Frank and another one of Svevo's men is killed during the shootout. Water floods the deck as Turner's group proceed to up to the next deck through a flooding elevator shaft, but Hannah falls into the rising water and drowns, while Turner loses his salvaged diamonds. Svevo and his one remaining henchman head back up to the ship's stern and make it out, where the rest of Svevo's team aboard his salvage boat cut another hole in the Poseidon's hull and attempt raise the plutonium crates from the cargo hold using a crane up to the hull of the ship, which is still above water but is slowly sinking.\n\nIn another section of the ship, Turner and the survivors exit the ship through an underwater side door, but due to shortage of scuba tanks, Wilbur (unknown to Turner and his group) sacrifices himself by swimming underwater and disappearing. Turner and Celeste swim to the tugboat Jenny and move it closer to the Poseidon as the remaining survivors swim towards it. Svevo's men see them and open fire and kill Tex, who willingly holds onto a bottle of champagne as he goes down. Turner's group makes it to his boat and they sail away. Water continues to flood the Poseidon and cause the on-board boilers to explode, which causes the cargo of plutonium to also do so. The Poseidon completely explodes, killing Svevo and his men.\n\nOn board Turner's boat, Turner accepts that his tugboat S.S. Jenny will be taken from him when they get to port, but Celeste reveals a diamond that she salvaged from the Poseidon. Celeste asks Turner, \"Are you going to kiss me now?\" and Turner replies, \"I was going to kiss you anyway.\" They kiss and the tugboat Jenny sails away into the sunset with the survivors Gina, Theresa, Larry, and Harold."

    "Bhagavanth Kesari": "Nelakonda Bhagavanth Kesari is an ex-prisoner who becomes the guardian of Vijayalakshmi \"Viji\" after his friend and Viji's father, CI Srikanth's death in an accident. Bhagavanth wants her to join the Indian Army as per her father's wish and seeks the help of psychologist Dr. Kathyayani.

    "Bharat": "During the 1947 Partition of India, Gautam Kumar (Jackie Shroff) and his family board a train to India with thousands of refugees to save themselves from the terrible riots. In the chaos, Gautam's young son, Bharat (then 8 years old) (Salman Khan), accidentally loses his baby sister, Gudiya (Tabu). Gautam stays behind to search for her, despite knowing the risk, and tells his son to take his mother and two younger siblings to Bharat's aunt's imported goods store. Before letting go, Gautam has Bharat promise him that Bharat will keep the family together in his place. At the aunt's place, Jamuna (Ayesha Raza Mishra) gives them shelter, but her hubby Keemat (Kumud Mishra) is not very supportive of her brother's family living with them.\n\nAs a child, Bharat takes all sorts of odd jobs to support his family. In 1964, as a pre-teen, he joins The Great Russian Circus with his best friend, Vilayati (Sunil Grover), and spends several years there, becoming one of the biggest attractions of the show, and wooing Radha (Disha Patani) in the process. He leaves the circus when his brother Chote (Shashank Arora) hurts himself in an accident while trying to emulate him.\n\nMeanwhile Mehek (Kashmira Irani), Bharat's sister was now of a marriageable age.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Bharat joins the Indian migration prompted by the discovery of oil in the Gulf region, as he hopes to earn enough to send back home. Here, he falls in love with his chief engineer Kumud Raina (Katrina Kaif) and survives a mining accident. Kumud confesses her love for him, but he tells Kumud he can't marry her, as he is afraid such a commitment will come in the way of fulfilling his father's promise and leaves Saudi Arabia after his visa expires. Back home in India, Kumud arrives during his sister Mehek's wedding to announce their love, and says she is okay with being in a relationship without marriage. Bharat's mother agrees on Bharat's wish that they can be in a live-in relationship.\n\nA few years pass and Bharat's aunt dies in 1983. His now-elderly uncle, in need of money, decides to sell the imported goods store, a move Bharat disagrees with. He leaves India again with Vilayati to take jobs as sailors to earn enough money to buy the store from his uncle. After 8 months aboard the ship, during which Vilayati gets married to Suzan (Nora Fatehi) at Malta, and they later thwart a pirate attack, Bharat returns to India and successfully buys the store. He runs it throughout the 1990s as more changes in India take place, and life goes on.\n\nKumud becomes the creative director of the then-newly formed channel, Zee TV, and runs a program in which relatives separated during the Partition are reunited. Bharat is featured in hopes of finding his long-lost sister, Gudiya, and his father. A woman from London (Tabu) who was adopted as a child by a British family during the Partition comes on the program. Bharat converses with her and realizes that she is indeed Gudiya. An emotional reunion ensues and his sister travels to India to see them. Bharat's mother passes away soon after. Bharat hopes to also find his father through the show but is unsuccessful.\n\nIn the present day, an elderly Bharat finally decides to sell his aunt's imported goods store, which, up to this point, he stubbornly refused to do despite the store's losing money. Before letting go on the train, Bharat's father had promised that he would come reunite with the rest of the family at the store, thus explaining why Bharat bought and held on to the store for so long. Bharat wistfully realizes that his father is probably too old now to still be alive. His father's spirit appears to him and assures Bharat that he indeed kept his promise of keeping the family together. He tells Bharat that it is time to let him go and move on, freeing Bharat of the promise and hope he has held onto all these years. Bharat breaks into tears and leaves the store, finally letting go of his father. In the final scene, he is shown getting married to Kumud, finally deciding to move on with his life."

    "Bholaa": "SP Diana Joseph (Tabu) captures members of the Sikka Gang and confiscates a haul of cocaine worth Rs 1,000 Crores. An undercover officer Abbas Ali (Tarun Gahlot ) known as Raunak, has joined Ashwathama (Deepak Dobriyal) (known as Ashu) who is co-leader of the Sikka Gang. Raunak gives information about Ashu to Diana.\n\nAshu seeks help from corrupt NCB officer Devraj Subramaniam (Gajraj Rao) who instructs another corrupt officer Deep Singh (Lokesh Mittal) to add Rohypnol to drinks made for police officers at the farewell party of IG Jayant Malik (Kiran Kumar). Devraj has agreed to help Ashu recover the cocaine in exchange for a share of Rs 50 Crores. Devraj tells Ashu that there is a traitor in his gang and tells him that Diana is the officer after the Sikka gang. Ashu swears vengeance. Diana does not partake but everyone else falls unconscious. Diana knows that the Sikka gang will want to recover the drugs. Diana has stored the drugs at Laalganj police station. She doesn't know that she has Ashu's brother Nithari in her custody as nobody has ever seen him. Laalganj is a British era jail made of solid stone and has a bunker in the basement.\n\nA prisoner named Bholaa (Ajay Devgn) has been released from prison, but was arrested by an officer on his way to the town for his arrogance. The officer had brought Bholaa to the party, with him handcuffed in the back of his jeep. After the entire force passed out, Bholaa was the only one Diana could turn to for help. Joseph tries to convince him to drive a truck taking the sedated officers to the hospital then on to Laalganj police station. Although he is reluctant at first (he was on his way to meet his daughter after spending 10 years in jail), he agrees when Diana says that he is condemning many other daughters by abandoning their fathers.\n\nMeanwhile, Ashu hires a bounty hunter on Joseph and the rest of her police force. As Joseph, Bholaa and sidekick Kadchi (Amir Khan) drive they are attacked by various gangs. The mole Deep Singh, who has hidden with the sedated officers, provides them with the location updates. Bholaa reveals his fighting powers and kills all the goons. Ashu also sends his gang to attack the police station and to free his brother Nithari (Vineet Kumar), who was caught with the cocaine. A new inspector, Angad Yadav (Sanjay Mishra), who was recently transferred to Laalganj, gets assigned by Joseph to defend the police station. Bholaa cannot understand why he is involved in this fight, but Diana continues to remind him his civic and national duty. She promises to unite him with his daughter. Bholaa wants a room for his daughter and an admission in a good school.\n\nWhen Ashu arrives with his gang, they try to breach the police station which is barricaded by Yadav and some students who happened to be at the station at that time. Joseph is nearly tricked into ordering the release of the prisoners (she offers a deal to release the prisoners in exchange for Ashu not killing anyone in the station), but she realizes that it was a trap set by Nithari who was in the lock up. Nithari planned to kill everybody after being released.\n\nAshu manages to get inside but Yadav and the students manage to arrest him. The student Chetan (Chetan Sharma) gets strangled to death by Ashu's gang with a lasso through a window and Yadav, fuming with rage, kills Ashu. Joseph contacts medics to provide an emergency ambulance at a temple of Lord Shiva. As they wait, Bholaa narrates his past to Kadchi: he was a notorious gangster in Uttar Pradesh and fell in love with a doctor named Swara (Amala Paul), who reciprocated his love after he saved her from being sexually assaulted.\n\nBefore their marriage, Bholaa gave up his gangster life, but Swara was killed by a ruthless gang leader known as Chomu (Abhishek Bachchan). Before dying, Swara gave birth to their daughter, Jyoti (Hirva Trivedi) but Bholaa got separated from her after receiving a long-term prison sentence. Joseph shares her story about how she lost her unborn child when she was pregnant. An ambulance finally arrives and takes the sedated officers to hospital, then Ashu's big henchman Bhoora (Arpit Ranka) also turns up. Before Bholaa is able to fight, Deep Singh stabs him, and he is brutally injured. While Joseph and Kadchi are taken away, Abbas is killed when he is discovered as the mole. Bholaa later regains consciousness and kills the whole gang all by himself, including Deep Singh, using the Trident of Lord Shiva. After this he chases after Bhoora, killing him and rescuing Joseph.\n\nAfter driving all night, Bholaa, Kadchi and Diana arrive in Laalganj police station using a secret passage and help the students along with Yadav to escape safely. Joseph burns the cocaine and after Ashu's reinforced gang finally breaches station, Bholaa destroys them all using a M134 Minigun.\n\nShortly after, Nithari dies of shock after learning about Bholaa, and Devraj Subramaniam shoots himself after knowing that Bholaa was behind everything. Bholaa is reunited with his daughter Jyoti and they drive off happily in the truck with Kadchi and a puppy. In a mid-credits scene, Chomu Singh learns about Bholaa's release and decides to destroy him."

Oskari picks one of the picture frames, that is his dad as a hunter when he was teenager.\n\nSomewhere in Finland, the Kimmo's Safari's helicopter carrying the terrorist named Hazar. After they land the helicopter, the Kimmo's Safari's helicopter pilot realized that the men he carrying are the terrorists. Hazar told the helicopter pilot to run for his lives. However when the helicopter pilot is in about one mile distance, Hazar fires bazooka to him as a missile test. Hazar sends his fellow terrorist a text message that the missile test was successful.\n\nIn the mountains, Oskari takes a test of strength of pulling of a bow string (without an arrow), however, he failed to reach its full strength. The leader of the deer hunting says that he will not ready to be a deer hunter but his father asserts that his son is ready to be a hunter. The leader addresses to his men about his bravery of being a hunter and inside the forest. Oskari drives his small tractor through the woods for hunting.\n\nMeanwhile, aboard in the Air Force One, U.S. President William Alan \"Bill\" Moore (Samuel L. Jackson) is heading for Pre D8 Summit is Helsinki, 45 miles left. Suddenly, the control room receives an alert of a possible missile shot down in their plane. However, both plane and jet escorts were unable to countermeasures because someone's jamming their control. The men quickly brought the President to an escape pod and it deploys out safely. The rest of the service agents are parachuting down from the plane but Morris (Ray Stevenson) shoots a secret agent after curiously asked that there is something wrong to them - their parachute not deploying. Few minutes after Morris parachuting down, the missiles fly past to him and hit the Air Force One.\n\nOskari is driving his small tractor in the woods when he sees the bright light flashes in the sky. In horror, Oskari quickly runs away from the bright light which is actually the downed Air Force One is on fire. Its debris almost struck Oskari.\n\nMorris was landed into the woods, turns out to be traitor, he alerts the terrorist that the plane was down. Oskari then sees a pod and suspiciously approaches to it. Upon approaching, Bill writes the combination (which is \"1492\" ) - for opening the door - in the moisturized window. After Oskari enters the combination, he quickly runs away from it, believing that the pod was came from other planet. Bill goes out and yells to show himself. Oskari shows himself and suspiciously aims his bow to Bill. When Bill tells him that he is the President of the United States, Oskari proves him by showing his passport. Oskari now trusts him.\n\nMeanwhile, in the farmhouse somewhere in Norway, a farmer sees the beacon landed outside his house. Shortly, the helicopters arrive but when they searched it, it is not escape pod. The escape pod and the beacon must been separated.\n\nMorris, Hazar and his men found the escape pod. As Hazar opens it, they find empty. Bill wants to go to the nearest town using his small tractor but Oskari not allows Bill to drive himself in. Instead, Oskari drives and tells him to sit in the wagon while they heading to the place that is marked by X on his map. Morris sees the small shoe footprint, stating that someone helped the President out. Morris also tells Hazar that the bullet was buried 2mm from his heart (as we see his scar in the chest in the beginning of the film) and if something hits it, it will kill him.\n\nBill and Oskari arrives in the place and he calls it, \"a perfect place to hunt\". They will camp here all night until morning and they chat each other. The next morning, it's Oskari's birthday and time for him to hunt. Bill suddenly wakes up when he hears Oskari imitating deer sounds. Oskari sees a shoe that is belong to Bill (the shoe was fell after the AF1 was shot down). Oskari then sees a freezer and when he opens it, inside is the dead deer and the note embedded in the arrow. The note says happy birthday from his dad. Upon Bill climbing through rocks, he sees his three dead men, turns out the cable ties preventing the parachute from deploying. Bill now realizes that Morris betrayed him. After he retrieved the gun from a dead man, Bill sees Morris and his men and he hides behind the rock.\n\nOskari is disappointed when his father killed the deer for him as birthday. Oskari told Bill that he is not ready to be a hunter. Bill then puts a badge onto Oskari for rescuing and protecting him, and it's a reminder for him. Bill realizes that his plane is not an accident, it is shot down and Morris and his men are there for hunting him. In case he is being hunted, he told Oskari to go in separate ways but Oskari worries about his safety. Shortly, Morris approaches upon them. Bill decides Oskari to go away for lives. Bill tries to shoot Morris but he forgot to cock the gun. Morris manage to fight Bill.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Pentagon Headquarters, they find the President and the terrorists who known by one of the President Secret Service Agent, Herbert (Jim Broadbent). All throughout, they're being tracked for their safety.\n\nThe men forces Bill to get in the freezer. However, Oskari oversees them and the President being put in the freezer. The freezer was carried by the helicopter. Oskari manages to save the president. Oskari jumps off the cliff and stows away to the freezer. A pilot sees stowaway boy in the freezer, trying to save the President. The helicopter descends its altitude to get the boy away from it. Oskari loses the freezer but manage to chase and he cut the rope, allowing it to escape. Morris, in the helicopter, shoots them and Oskari quickly gets in to the freezer. The lid of the freezer protecting them from raining bullets. Oskari decides to roll down the freezer into the cliff just moments after Morris gets on the ground. They ended up in the middle of the lake.\n\nBoth Bill and Oskari think that they lost them. Shortly, they found the wreck site of Air Force One near them. In the Pentagon, they found the AF1 crash site. Herbert gives the coordinates of the crash site to Hazar and gives a plan to him to kill the President.\n\nBill and Oskari sees the helicopter approaching upon them and they manage to enter the wrecked plane. The plane inside is almost quite intact (the lights are still on and some computers in the control room are still on also). Afterwards, they hear pounding and creaking sound coming from the roof. Suddenly the explosive blown to the roof, allowing Hazar to infiltrate the plane. Hazar then activates a bomb to six minutes left. The fight progress between Bill and Hazar. Hazar manage to strangle Bill to death but Oskari pounds Hazar in the head. Hazar then tries to shoot Oskari using the same gun (that Bill uses and forgot to cock), but also he forgot to cock it. Bill kicks him, throwing a gun onto Bill, this time allowing him to shoot Hazar. Almost 90 seconds left in the bomb, Bill and Oskari manage to escape from the plane through ejecting in the pilot's seat. As they deployed the parachute in their seats, Morris - in the helicopter - is in front of them. Oskari then fires an arrow and hits his chest. The arrow pulls the bullet - buried inside his chest - into his heart, Morris fall to his death and accidentally fires a gun onto the pilot. Shortly, the bomb goes off.\n\nMeanwhile at the same time in deer hunters' camp, the US Navy forces the hunters to held hostage until the President reportedly alive.

    "Big Hero 6": "In the city of San Fransokyo (a portmanteau of San Francisco and Tokyo), Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter) is a teenage prodigy, but seems to be unable to use his intellect for anything more than trying to enter illegal, back-alley bot-fights.\n\nHis older brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) wishes to change Hiro's mind, and tricks his brother into coming to the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology, where Tadashi is a student. While there, Hiro is introduced to a number of Tadashi's 'nerd school' friends: Go Go (Jamie Chung), Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.), Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez), and Fred (T.J. Miller), and the different inventions they have constructed.\n\nTadashi then shows Hiro his own project: an inflatable 'nurse' robot, named Baymax (Scott Adsit). Thanks to a chip that Tadashi programmed with numerous medical analysis information, Baymax is quite knowledgeable, impressing Hiro. Once he has performed his task, Baymax returns to sleep mode by being told, \"I am satisfied with my care.\"\n\nThe three also meet Robert Callaghan (James Cromwell), the head professor of the Institute, and after he compliments Hiro on the miniature battle-robot he's made, Hiro wants to enter the Institute.\n\nTadashi then encourages his brother to come up with something that will impress Callaghan at the next robotics exhibit coming up. After Tadashi encourages his brother to 'use that big brain of yours,' Hiro then uses the robotic technology in his battle-bot, and crafts them into thousands of micro-bots, controlled by a neural transmitter. Whatever the wearer thinks, the microbots will do.\n\nNeedless to say, Hiro's presentation wins over a number of people at the exhibition, even impressing a high-profile technology guru, named Alistair Krei (Alan Tudyk). Alistair offers to purchase Hiro's microbot invention on the spot, but Callaghan claims that Krei is not a trustworthy man with technology. Hiro then declines Krei's request, but is excited when Callaghan presents him with a letter of acceptance to the Institute.\n\nHiro, Tadashi, and their friends head off to celebrate, but the mood is cut short when a fire erupts within the exhibition hall. With word that Callaghan is still inside, Tadashi rushes into the building to save him. However, as Hiro watches, an explosion rocks the building, blasting him back.\n\nAfter Tadashi's funeral, Hiro becomes distant from his friends, still working through his grief. His aunt (and guardian) Cass (Maya Rudolph), tries to encourage Hiro to go to the Institute and take advantage of his acceptance letter, but he seems unwilling to do so.\n\nAfter accidentally hurting himself in his room, Hiro is surprised when Baymax appears. Apparently, Tadashi had brought him back to their shared bedroom before he died. Baymax attempts to help Hiro, who is reluctant to accept it. However, the mood is broken when Hiro finds one of his microbots wriggling in a pocket of his jacket. Putting it in a specimen container, Hiro tries to ignore it, but Baymax notes inquires if he can try to determine where the 'small robot' wishes to go.\n\nHiro casually affirms this...not realizing that the robot will follow his commands. Chasing him down, Hiro and Baymax find themselves at an old warehouse. Sneaking inside, Hiro is surprised to find a machine churning out similar microbots, with numerous containers filled with them. However, his surprise turns to shock, when a masked man appears, attempting to kill Hiro and Baymax with the miniature robots.\n\nHiro first goes to the police station to report what he's found, but the officer taking down his story seems reluctant to believe him. It also doesn't help that Baymax's battery starts to run low. Hiro manages to get him home to be recharged. It is then that Baymax inquires where Tadashi is. Hiro attempts to explain to the robot that his brother is 'gone.' When Hiro explains that the fire was an accident, he then begins to wonder, given what he saw today...what if it wasn't, an accident?\n\nDeciding to figure out who has stolen his invention, Hiro decides to upgrade Baymax. After creating a carbon-fiber suit for the robot, Hiro also programs a new chip that includes numerous martial arts moves, inserting it into an additional slot in Baymax's 'heart' drive, right next to Tasashi's chip of Baymax's programming.\n\nThe two then return to the warehouse, only to find it empty. However, Hiro notes his microbot has started to move again, and the two follow its movements to the docks off San Fransokyo. However, something pulls the microbot out of the container, and it disappears off into the misty bay. However, moments later, the masked figure appears, using the microbots as a transport means, and carrying a large object with the symbol of a red bird on it.\n\nHiro is just about to send Baymax to get the masked man, when they are accosted by Hiro's friends. Baymax's invite for them to help cheer up Hiro got through, but just then, the masked man attacks them. The group pile into Wasabi's car, as the masked man gives chase. In the aftermath, the car ends up driving into the bay, but the group is saved by Baymax, who has shed his armor, and helps the group float to the surface.\n\nAfter getting on land, Fred leads the group to his home...which happens to be a large mansion owned by his parents (who are away).\n\nWhile recovering, Hiro shows the group the red bird symbol he saw on the piece of machinery to his friends, but none have seen it. The group soon comes to a consensus, that the man may have been behind Tadashi's death, and Fred believes he knows who it is: Alistair Krei. Fred explains that it was Krei who wanted Hiro's microbot technology, and most likely, has gained it at the expense of Tadashi's life.\n\nBaymax also surprises Hiro, when he explains that during the fight, he scanned the masked man, and has information on his health and vitals. Hiro wants to identify where their adversary is, but he would need to scan everyone in San Fransokyo to find out.\n\nThe group then decides to band together to stop Krei, with Hiro helping to design them each special suits based on their specific abilities.\n\nOnce Hiro has done this, he and Baymax fly up above the city, and scan the city from an aerial fan. Baymax's sensors pick up their adversary's health vitals, coming from an island in the bay.\n\nThe group flies there, to find a deserted base. One room shows the twisted metal remains of some machine, with the red bird symbol on it. The group then goes into a control room, where video shows that the room was used for testing a teleportation project, called \"Operation: Silent Sparrow.\"\n\nSuddenly, their masked adversary appears, and the group attempts to take him down, but are completely unsure what to do. Hiro manages to unmask their foe, but instead of finding Krei...he finds Professor Callaghan.\n\nCallaghan explains that in the fire, he managed to use Hiro's microbot technology to shield himself from the explosion. This infuriates Hiro, who demands that Baymax destroy Callaghan. Baymax claims that his programming doesn't allow this, leading to Hiro pulling out the chip Tadashi put in him. The removal of the chip causes Baymax to follow Hiro's orders, and he charges at Callaghan. However, Hiro's friends attempt to stop Baymax, with the robot fighting back at them, before Honey manages to restore Tadashi's chip to his programming.\n\nCallaghan has escaped during the fight, and Hiro demands that Baymax find him, only for the robot to explain that his scanners are damaged. Bent on revenge, Hiro blasts away with Baymax back to the garage. He attempts to update Baymax's programming, but Baymax refuses to open the port where his chip information is.\n\nIn desperation, Hiro finally breaks down over the death of his brother, with Baymax countering that, 'Tadashi is here.' As Hiro watches, Baymax projects video of Tadashi's numerous attempts to get him running, with the 84th test being a success, and Tadashi claiming that Baymax is \"going to help a whole lot of people.\"\n\nHiro's friends eventually return to the garage where he is, and reveal that they have found further footage of the military test. The footage shows Professor Callaghan also at the test area, and reveal his motives behind his actions. During the test, a human test subject was propelled into the portal. However, the portal became unstable, and Krei ordered it shut down. It turns out that the test subject, was Callaghan's daughter, Abigail (Katie Lowes).\n\nThe next day, Krei is revealing the opening of a new facility in the heart of San Fransokyo, when Callaghan appears, using the microbots to piece together the last active portal, over Krei's building. Callaghan claims he's going to ruin Krei's life like he ruined his, as the portal comes to life, and starts to tear apart the building, sucking its pieces into the other dimension.\n\nIt is then that Hiro and his friends appear, pleading with Callaghan to stop what he's doing, but the former Professor refuses to listen to reason. The group attempts to stop him, but Callaghan uses the microbots to counter their attacks.\n\nDuring the fight, Hiro notices that the stray microbots are being sucked up into the portal, and he and the rest of the team work to hack away at their structures, until Callaghan is soon down to a bare minimum.\n\nBaymax manages to remove the control mask from him, but once he's done so, notes a faint life signal from within the portal. Even though it is unstable, Hiro and Baymax head into it.\n\nWithin the otherworldly atmosphere, they find the test pod, with Abigail inside. Baymax and Hiro then attempt to maneuver her out of the dimension, but a stray piece of debris from Krei's building slams into Baymax, ripping away much of his suit, and rendering his rocket boosters inoperable.\n\nBaymax claims that he can get Hiro and Abigail to safety by using his rocket punch. Hiro doesn't want to lose Baymax, but the robot assures the boy, that he'll \"always be with him.\" Tearfully, Hiro utters \"I'm satisfied with my care,\" and Baymax launches off his rocket fist, getting Hiro and Callaghan's daughter through the portal, just before it tears itself apart.\n\nIn the aftermath, Abigail is taken to a hospital, and Callaghan is arrested for his crimes. In the meantime, local news reports on a band of superheroes that saved the city. However, Hiro and his friends celebrate by having some downtime at his Aunt's place.\n\nShortly afterwards, Hiro starts his classes at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology. Taking residence in the same lab that Tadashi has, Hiro has brought along the rocket fist Baymax wore...only to find wedged in its closed fist, the green microchip card that Tadashi had put into Baymax.\n\nHiro manages to rebuild Baymax, and places the chip inside him, embracing his fellow comrade. In the end, we see Hiro, Baymax, and their friends, running through the streets of San Fransokyo, ready to help their city, in any way they can."

    "Big Man Japan": "Who knew, that being a modern Japanese superhero was this hard? It's a dirty job but somebody's got to do it. In a way being extraordinarily gifted in one sense, leaves the hero extraordinarily burdened by the \"thousand cuts\" of postmodern Japan.\n\nBig Man (Sato) must be on-call 24/7 to the decrepit ministry of monster prevention, a sub division of the defence ministry, who arrange for him to physically transform into gigantic proportions when needed. This has taken it's toll on his mental balance. He is not paid anywhere near what he feels would be just compensation for this government job. Sadly forsaken by the Japanese public, deeply estranged from his own wife and daughter, he is reduced to earning extra pay by offering advertising \"spots\" on his body during his bouts with the monsters. However his ennui and frustrations with his station in life leave him constantly arguing with his talent agent, as the \"ratings\" of his monster bouts dip on T.V. Sato, also has aspirations of being financially successful enough to provide personal care for his aging and senile grandfather, who was also quite the monster slayer in his time, and from whom Sato's father and himself have inherited the ability to physically transform. The story is told from the perspective of a biographical documentary-in-the-making about his life, for Japanese TV.\n\nIn his career, Sato succesfully dispatches the tossing monster, one-legged leaping monster, and the evil-eye monster, but accidentally kills a rather harmless monster baby provoking a mass outcry against his cruelty. Each monster encounter is carried in a separate episode live on TV as part of a reality show. Also he proves incapable of getting rid of the stink monster who actually mates with another monster on his live telecast bout, upsetting public morals of decency. To make matters worse, his senile father, bulks up one day and busts out of the senior care hospice where he lives, in order to have a fun, solo \"night on the town (Tokyo)\", reliving his glory days, but disrupting the busy city's efficient civilian life. This entails more bad press for Sato, portraying \"his kind\" in mock hues, and making it even more difficult to sell his TV show and body advertising.\n\nDuring one of the encounters, a \"foreign\" gangster type monster actually overcomes Sato, breaking his nose, while stomping on him, and scaring Sato enough to run away from the battle. His reputation is now vulnerable. This professional challenge in addition to his other personal problems proves most burdensome until he meets \"Justice\" Family, who turn up like guardian angels to kick the heck out of the foreign red monster."

Billy Asher) comes knocking on the Reverend's door just as Gus and Charlie discover the snuff movies the Rev has been producing. The deputy informs Charlie, who he assumes lives in the house, that the Reverend's body has just been found in a car down the road. In his surprise at finding out that the person he accidentally killed wasn't the reverend after all, Charlie acts suspiciously enough to invoke the Deputy's detective skills. Desperate to get rid of him, Gus knocks him out with an ornament, and they tie him up. The door opens and the Reverend's wife Mrs. Smalls (Mimi Rogers) enters, confessing to having murdered her husband whom she calls a pervert. She's looking for her partner who is due to arrive and run away with her and the $2 million they have in a bag, revealing the identity of the man that just drowned in the septic tank.\n\nJust when Mrs. Smalls is about to shoot Deputy Garman, Josie comes to the rescue and plants an axe in Mrs Rev.'s head. Three dead, a police deputy for a hostage and a bag of money, the trio figure that it's time to get away. The deputy, heavily intoxicated thanks to Josie's plan to make him appear guilty, tries escaping through the bathroom window and cracks his skull open on the toilet, raising the death toll to four.\n\nSo the three fugitives, with two bodies in suitcases in the trunk, drive to get rid of the bodies when they run into another car in town, in the rain, and meet some old little guy. They bribe him to forget about it.\n\nThey finally arrive at a remote spot to dump the bodies. Ah. make that one body, and a bloody suitcase that's open. Driving back to find the other body - did Josie's axe in the head actually do the deed? - they run straight into (and over) her, and kill her for sure. Just then, they hear police sirens. Charlie's wife, Penny (Natascha McElhone), who's the sheriff in town, stops them. One very quick adlibbed excuse later, and they are all down at the police station.\n\nLittle guy turns out to be the FBI agent Hymes (Jon Polito) sent to investigate the case of the local serial killer \"the Oregon Undertaker\", and he recognizes the gang. They somehow they get away with it all with only one body left to get rid of. They try the local tar pit, but as Charlie points out it'll take about a week for the body to actually sink. Agent Hymes shows up, having acted on his suspicions, and identifies Josie as the \"Wyoming Widow\" serial poisoner, and a running battle ensues. Hymes, who turns out to be a dirty agent, kills Gus as he's trying to make a run for it with the bag full of money. Josie and Charlie then kill Hymes with his own disease. Turning on Charlie just when he thinks it's all over, Josie kills him, but the joke is on her as she discovers that the bag of money, seen minutes before with $2 million in it, has a load of toys in it now... The camera cuts to Emily (Olivia Peterson), Charlie's daughter, having fun with a bag of bank notes.\n\nIn the final scene, Josie is shown hitching a lift with some guy with an Oregon license plate, who happens to have the body of a young woman in the back of his truck, just like the Oregon Undertaker."

    "Big Red": "Cute Disney fare.\n\nBrief Overview\n\nWealthy sportsman James Haggin (Walter Pidgeon) lives on a Quebec estate called Wintapi. \u00c9mile Fornet (\u00c9mile Genest), handler of Haggin's hunting dogs, and \u00c9mile's wife Therese (Janette Bertrand), Haggin's cook and housekeeper, live in a separate house on the estate. To start a line of top show dogs, Haggin purchases the winner of the Montreal Kennel Club show, an Irish setter named Red. French-Canadian boy Ren\u00e9 Dumont (Gilles Payant) arrives at Wintapi on foot looking for work. He lived with his uncle in a cabin in the wild country and had no formal schooling. The uncle has died. Haggin hires Ren\u00e9 to help care for the dogs, especially Red, whom he expects to win the Westminster show in New York the next month. Ren\u00e9 is quartered inside the kennel.\n\nRen\u00e9 and Red develop a special bond. The dog is too distracted by the boy to perform correctly for his owner, so Haggin moves Red to the main house until the show, and Ren\u00e9 is not to see the dog. Mollie, the mate selected for Red, arrives and is placed in Red's kennel. On the eve of the departure for New York, Ren\u00e9 sneaks to the main house to say goodbye to Red. Determined to follow the boy, Red crashes through a window and is gravely injured. Haggin orders the dog euthanized, but Ren\u00e9 sneaks Red away to his dead uncle's cabin and nurses him back to health. He returns the dog to Haggin. Red is scarred but still valuable for stud. Haggin wants to hire the boy back, but Ren\u00e9 finds work at the neighboring dairy farm.\n\nHaggin ships Red and the pregnant Mollie by train to Montreal to be sold. On the way, they escape from the baggage car into the wild. When Ren\u00e9 learns of this, he takes the train to where they were last seen and tracks them down on foot, reuniting with them just as Mollie gives birth to four pups. When Haggin learns that Ren\u00e9 has not shown up for work at the dairy farm for two weeks, he sets out on horseback to find the boy's cabin and learn what has happened. Man, boy and dogs are reunited in the woods, but not before Haggin encounters a cougar, loses his horse and gets trapped by a boulder. Red and Ren\u00e9 rescue him from cougar and boulder. Haggin proposes that Ren\u00e9 live with him at Wintapi and go to school. Ren\u00e9 accepts the offer, and they all walk back to Wintapi.\n\nDetailed Synopsis\n\nAt an outdoor dog show of the Montreal Kennel Club, a magnificent Irish setter wins Best in Show. Wealthy hunting-dog owner James Haggin (Walter Pidgeon) instructs his handler, \u00c9mile Fornet (\u00c9mile Genest), to buy the dog; \u00c9mile may go as high as $5,000 with his offer.\n\nThe dog travels by train to Haggin's Quebec estate, Wintapi. Ren\u00e9 Dumont (Gilles Payant), a French-Canadian boy, arrives on foot at Wintapi carrying his travel bag with one hand and playing his harmonica with the other. He sees the Irish setter in its kennel run; boy and dog form an instant bond. The dog gets his left paw caught in the kennel fence, and Ren\u00e9 frees it. He enters through a gate identifying the occupant as Champion Redcoat Reilly of Wintapi, and the dog licks the boy's face in gratitude.\n\nTwo gunshots are heard, and the dog bolts out through the open kennel gate and across a field where Haggin is hunting pheasant with \u00c9mile and two of his hunting dogs. Haggin wonders how Red got out and sends \u00c9mile after him. The boy also runs after the dog, slowing to speak in French to Haggin as he passes. Red scares up the pheasant and chases and corners it. Ren\u00e9 finds the dog first and uses his belt as a leash. He's taking Red back with one hand and holding his pants up with the other when Haggin stops him and asks, \"Just where do you think you're going with that dog?\" \u00c9mile catches up and translates the boy's French. Ren\u00e9 assures Haggin he was not stealing the dog. He was looking for the boss to ask for work. He speaks English, but when events move rapidly he cannot find the right words. Haggin allows that \"events are moving much too rapidly.\" Learning that Monsieur is the boss, the boy introduces himself: \"Monsieur, I am Ren\u00e9 Jean Paul Dumont. I am a strong worker; I do not get tired. I have lived with my uncle who trapped the fox, but now my uncle is dead, so I must work. I am learning to speak English from a book, and I like animals very much.\" He explains how the dog got loose after getting his left paw caught in the kennel wire. \u00c9mile checks the paw for damage, but there is none. Haggin gives the boy a job, and Ren\u00e9 thanks him: \"Merci, Monsieur le Boss!\" Haggin takes Red away, and \u00c9mile tells Ren\u00e9 to put on his belt so that his trousers do not descend.\n\nThat night, studying from his book, Ren\u00e9 practices his English in his new sleeping quarters inside the kennel as Red and the other dogs watch. \u00c9mile comes in and checks on the boy. He describes Ren\u00e9's duties and impresses upon him the importance of Red's care in particular. Ren\u00e9 is amazed that one dog cost $5,000. \u00c9mile explains that there will be a dog show in New York City the following month, and if Red wins this show, he'll be the best dog in North America, perhaps in the whole world: \"And that is what Monsieur Haggin wants more than any one thing.\" As Ren\u00e9 prepares for bed, he says to Red: \"Five thousand dollars. It is an honor to sleep in the same room with such a dog.\"\n\nNext morning, \u00c9mile is showing Ren\u00e9 the proper technique for brushing a dog when Haggin calls for him to bring Red outside. Ren\u00e9 makes a faux pas when he takes Red out through the swinging dog door between the inside kennel and the outside run. Haggin begins Red's training and says he'll be tough on him, as that Westminster show isn't so far off. \u00c9mile says he'll be all the tough judges rolled into one. When Ren\u00e9 objects to Haggin's harsh tone, suggesting he speak to the dog with gentleness, he gets a little lecture from Monsieur: \"A dog is an animal; he's governed by conditioned reflexes. Dogs ... don't have human reactions, and the only way to handle them is with a firm voice and a tight lead.\" After Haggin departs, \u00c9mile advises Ren\u00e9 not to speak out to Monsieur unless he wants to join the ranks of the unemployed. He sends boy and dog off for a run through the fields but warns Ren\u00e9 not to let the dog off the lead. He adds, \"The next time Monsieur calls, the front door if you please?\"\n\nBoy and dog run together through field and stream. As they rest, Ren\u00e9 gets the idea to help Red walk as Monsieur wishes for the show ring, but the dog is quickly distracted by a pheasant. Ren\u00e9 tells him he has much to learn if he wants to be a hunting dog for Monsieur: \"One does not become a hunting dog overnight.\" A rabbit runs into a woodpile, and Red bolts after it. Ren\u00e9 loses the lead but catches up and tells Red, \"The rabbit, no; the pheasant, yes.\"\n\nIn the kitchen of the separate house where \u00c9mile and his wife Therese (Janette Bertrand) reside, Ren\u00e9 fashions a lure out of feathers while Therese prepares soup. He thanks her for the feathers and praises her soup, which he tastes, but he is too eager to go hunting with the big red dog to take time for a bowl of soup. She will save the soup till he comes back.\n\nRen\u00e9 runs with Red on a long lead. Then he brings out the lure and places it in a bush. He shows the dog how to smell the air, advance slowly and point. Red does not understand (but jumps over Ren\u00e9 twice). Ren\u00e9 says he'll never be a hunting dog and tells him to go walk around in dog shows the rest of his life. But when Red nestles on the boy's leg, Ren\u00e9 accepts his apology and says they'll try again tomorrow.\n\nThat evening after supper, Ren\u00e9 plays his harmonica as Therese washes the dishes and \u00c9mile smokes his pipe. Red lies under the table by Ren\u00e9's feet. Therese and \u00c9mile join the music, singing \"Mon Amour Perdu\" (My Lost Love) in French. Therese says it's a sad song, but it makes her happy sometimes to be sad. Then Ren\u00e9 and \u00c9mile start a harmonica-and-spoons duet with foot stomping, and \u00c9mile and Therese dance. The revelry is interrupted when Haggin comes in--he noticed Red was not in his kennel. Ren\u00e9 explains that he asked to bring Red there because the dog was lonely. He and \u00c9mile leave to take Red back to his kennel, and Therese serves coffee to Haggin. She thinks the music was good for Big Red, but he is skeptical: \"Improved his coat, huh?\" She speaks of happiness on the inside showing on the outside; she thinks it's good the boy and the dog have each other. \"One should never be alone,\" she says, \"even when one has great wealth.\" Her musings have shifted from the dog to its owner: \"One must forget that which is past; one must go forward.\" Haggin responds good-naturedly, \"I should have gotten rid of you five years ago, before you learned to cook.\"\n\nRen\u00e9 loses his boot while running in the field with Red on the long lead. Sitting on a rock by the stream to put his boot back on, he sets the lure down on another rock beside him. The breeze blows it into the water. It drifts downstream past Red's nose as he drinks from the stream, and he follows it. It gets into fast water and he breaks into a run. Ren\u00e9 once again loses the lead and must run after Red. The stream comes to a man-made pool and waterfall with a flume leading to an empty mill. Ren\u00e9 enters the mill and sees Red below him through a crack in the floorboards. Descending to the level below, he finds Haggin picking what appears to be coarse, sticky sawdust out of Red's coat.\n\nRen\u00e9 offers to quit \"le job\" and says he won't ask the full week of pay. But Haggin advises him: \"Never quit 'le job,' son. Just tell 'em you're unhappy and ask for twice the money.\" Ren\u00e9 helps pick the debris off the dog. Haggin explains that Red is not like their other dogs; he's what is called a bench dog: \"His kind aren't used for any practical purposes anymore. ... Once his kind were great hunters, but they're so good to look at that the hunting points were bred out. ... They've lost their most important point--the sense of responsibility.\" Red can still be ready for the dog show next month, and if he wins he'll be worth $10,000. Haggin shows Ren\u00e9 a photo of a female Irish setter: \"She's for him, to start the Wintapi Kennels, when he wins Best in Show at Westminster.\"\n\nWalking home, Haggin learns from Ren\u00e9 that his uncle's cabin is 20-25 miles north. Haggin has hunted in that area and knows it to be pretty rough country. Ren\u00e9 never went to school, but his uncle taught him from books. Haggin stresses the importance of school. Ren\u00e9 agrees but says, \"For me now, it is necessary to work and make my way in the world.\" Haggin says he won't get very far without an education: \"If you want to be a success ... make a lot of money ... that's what you want, isn't it?\" \"Oui, Monsieur,\" replies Ren\u00e9, \"but most of all I want to be useful; that I think is the first thing.\" Haggin has to agree.\n\nSpence Blake of the Montreal Kennel Club arrives at Wintapi to give his expert opinion on Red. (He was the Best in Show judge at the start of the movie.) Haggin explains that Red seems uncontrollable; he doesn't seem to want to perform anymore. Blake is puzzled: \"That's funny--an old trouper like Red.\" It becomes apparent to both men that the dog is too distracted by the boy who takes care of him--except when he's on the lead with Ren\u00e9. Haggin decides to keep Red in the main house with him until the dog show, and Ren\u00e9 is not to see Red for any reason. Haggin invites Blake to stay for lunch, and the two depart. Ren\u00e9 asks \u00c9mile, \"Pourquoi?\" \u00c9mile explains: \"Because that big foolish dog likes you too much. ... If he does not obey Monsieur he cannot win the show, and if he does not win the show Monsieur will sell him.\"\n\nRed lies at his master's feet as Haggin sits reading by the fire. Therese comes upstairs to take away Monsieur's dinner dishes, and Red follows her to the landing, where she gives him a morsel from the tray as she descends. Then Red hears the boy's harmonica and goes to the window seat to look out. Ren\u00e9 lies in bed and plays \"Mon Amour Perdu.\" He looks out his window and sees Red across the way, looking down at him sadly from the main house.\n\nChampion Ginger's Mollie O'Day arrives at Wintapi and settles into Red's kennel. \u00c9mile tells her: \"Mademoiselle, you are now at your own home--chez vous. If you wish for service, you have only to ring.\" He tells Ren\u00e9, \"With this one for Big Red, the Wintapi Kennel will be the best in the world!\" Ren\u00e9 is glum: if Big Red loses the showing, Monsieur Haggin will sell him, and then where will the kennel be? \u00c9mile: \"Monsieur Haggin is not a man who loses.\" Ren\u00e9: \"They are not judging Monsieur Haggin.\" But \u00c9mile is confident Big Red will win. The departure for New York is scheduled for the following day, and Ren\u00e9 asks if he can see Big Red tonight to say goodbye: \"For ten minutes perhaps?\" \u00c9mile refuses: \"For no minutes. Red is now content, and he will remain so.\"\n\nAfter dark, Red is again at the upstairs window as Ren\u00e9 stealthily approaches the main house. Ren\u00e9 peeks in the downstairs windows, and the dog comes down to look for him. They meet on opposite sides of the French doors, and Ren\u00e9 gets his chance to say goodbye, even though he cannot come inside. Then he runs from the house, but Red is determined to follow him. Haggin and Therese can't stop the dog, and he leaps through a window, breaking the glass and injuring himself. Ren\u00e9 runs back to him, and Red collapses. Ren\u00e9 embraces the dog as Haggin, Therese and \u00c9mile look on.\n\n\u00c9mile checks the dog on an examining table in the kennel. He shakes his head--the prognosis is grim. Haggin instructs \u00c9mile, \"Put him to sleep.\" Ren\u00e9 pleads with Haggin not to kill the dog: \"Please, let me take care of him, Monsieur.\" But Haggin is adamant: \"You don't want him to suffer, do you? ... Neither do I.\" Haggin leaves and \u00c9mile goes into the adjoining room to prepare the injection. When he returns, boy and dog are both gone. With his jacket draped over the dog, Ren\u00e9 carries him into the wilderness.\n\nTherese gives Haggin a difficult time: \"Was it so bad--a boy who wanted to say goodbye to a dog? Oh, but I have forgotten--he disobeyed Monsieur, and this is terrible.\" Haggin doesn't want to talk about it: \"Therese, it's over and done with, understand?\"\n\nRen\u00e9 nurses Red back to health at the cabin of his dead uncle. One day, Haggin is sitting in his yard preparing ammunition for hunting when an Irish setter comes up and sits by him. He wonders who let Mollie out until he realizes it's not Mollie but Red. Ren\u00e9 appears and tells where Red has been: \"Now I return him to you.\" Ren\u00e9 has his travel bag, but he doesn't share Haggin's enthusiasm at his return. Haggin says, \"Tell \u00c9mile you're back, and I'll tell Therese you're hungry,\" but Ren\u00e9 says he is not hungry. Haggin praises him for the fine job he did restoring the health of a dog that was practically dead: \"Let \u00c9mile see this; he'll never believe it.\" Red's as good as new, says Haggin: \"He'll take that New York show next year.\" But Ren\u00e9 says, \"No, Monsieur\"--Red has a scar that ruins him for showing. Haggin says he's still valuable for stud and reminds Ren\u00e9, \"Never quit le job.\" But Ren\u00e9 thinks it would be better if he found other work. Haggin says, \"I feel I owe you something,\" but Ren\u00e9 replies, \"You owe me nothing, Monsieur.\" Haggin reluctantly concedes the point: \"Okay.\" Ren\u00e9 cements it with his own \"okay\" and starts to leave, but Red follows him and tugs at his hand. He tells the dog in a firm voice to go back. Red does so reluctantly and sits beside his owner. Ren\u00e9 walks and then runs away.\n\nRed and Mollie are housed together; Red is disconsolate. Haggin arranges over the phone to have both dogs sold. He is shipping them that morning to a man named Jim. He tells Jim that Mollie will be having Red's pups in a couple of weeks--Jim can keep one if he likes and sell the rest. Then he adds, \"No, no, I don't think so,\" apparently on the question of Jim's holding back a pup for him. Therese has been dusting noisily, and Haggin hangs up and says, \"No comments, Therese.\" She replies: \"What is to comment? ... After all, a dog is only an animal. ... And if the dogs remind one of a certain person, that is unfortunate.\" Haggin reiterates, \"The dog is a closed subject,\" and leaves. Therese picks up a framed black-and-white photo of a young man in uniform and says to herself, \"There are many closed subjects in this house; I know that.\"\n\nRed and Mollie travel by train through the Canadian wilderness. They are together in one crate in the baggage car. The baggageman (Georges Bouvier) puts down a pan of water for them, but they can't reach it through the bars. He removes the lock on the door of the crate, and just then the train makes a sudden stop. He steps off the train to investigate. When he is gone, Red pushes open the door of the crate and goes to the open door of the baggage car, where Mollie joins him. There is a moose on the tracks. The baggageman has a remarkable talent that he has used before, and he is pressed into service again: he does a male moose call that lures the female off the tracks. When the train starts moving, Red and Mollie jump to freedom in the wild. The baggageman runs and jumps aboard the back of the moving train. The moose watches the train recede into the distance; Red and Mollie do the same.\n\nRen\u00e9 searches on foot for an errant cow. She's a big, gentle Brown Swiss dairy cow, and he finds her just over a broken-down spot in the split-rail fence around Wintapi. He points out to her that she's trespassing on the private property of Monsieur le Boss: \"This is not permitted.\" She lets out a loud moo, and he laughs. Haggin happens by just then in a one-horse carriage and asks, \"Your cow, Ren\u00e9?\" Ren\u00e9 replies that she belongs to the farm of Monsieur Mariot, where he is working now. He starts to take her away but comes back and asks: \"How is he, Monsieur? Is he well, Big Red?\" Haggin informs him that Red and Mollie ran away over a week ago. They were being shipped to Montreal for sale and got out of the baggage car. It was up in the Laurentians. He notified the forest rangers, but there's not much chance of finding them: \"Two kennel-bred dogs wouldn't last a week in that wild country. ... I'm as sorry as you are.\" Ren\u00e9 replies, \"I can understand, Monsieur; it is too bad to lose all that money.\" Haggin departs without another word.\n\nRen\u00e9 takes the same train to the spot where it stopped for the moose. He rides in the baggage car, and the same baggageman thinks his search will be impossible. But Ren\u00e9's uncle taught him how to track fox and wolf: \"A dog is no difference.\" When they reach the place, the baggageman wishes him \"bon chance,\" and he sets off on foot with rifle and backpack.\n\nRed and Mollie climb the rocks beside a magnificent waterfall with multiple cascading levels. Red hears Ren\u00e9 playing \"Mon Amour Perdu\" on his harmonica in the distance. At the top, Mollie finds a cave in which to have her pups, and Red helps her prepare a depression in the floor of the cave. Then he runs down to Ren\u00e9's campsite. After a joyful reunion, Ren\u00e9 gives Red smoked meat from the farm of Monsieur Mariot. As hungry as Red is, he takes the meat to Mollie and leads Ren\u00e9 to the cave where she is giving birth. They arrive just in time for Ren\u00e9 to present Red with his firstborn. In the morning Ren\u00e9 names one of the four pups 'Tit Rouge (Little Red) and tells Mollie that when they are big enough to travel, they will all go home. But that will be a while, and he and Big Red will hunt and bring them good things to eat.\n\nHaggin is bringing in his morning newspaper when he finds the same cow again on his property, eating one of his bushes: \"Good morning, madame. How are you? I wish you'd eat your breakfast elsewhere.\" It appears she broke through the fence again. Dairy farmer Mariot (Doris Lussier) arrives on horseback and observes, \"This is not a very strong gate, Mr. Haggin.\" He worries the bush might poison his cow, \"to say nothing of spoiling her milk.\" It's possible he'll have to take steps: \"In our province both the rich and the poor are equal before the law.\" Haggin says he thought the young boy Ren\u00e9 was tending the cow for him, but Mariot says the boy is no longer in his employ because he has not chosen to come to work for two weeks now: \"Perhaps he has gone to that cabin of his uncle to sit all day and play the harmonica. ... And if this cow gets away again, I'll have a good idea where to place the full responsibility, sir.\"\n\nEarly next morning, Therese is packing provisions into saddlebags when \u00c9mile comes down and asks what she's doing. It's for Monsieur Haggin, she explains. He is going into the woods to hunt--for one medium-size boy. He's going to the boy's cabin to see what has happened. \u00c9mile is surprised--only yesterday Monsieur said he was closing Wintapi to travel to Europe. \u00c9mile starts to go get his things, but Therese tells him he is going nowhere: \"This is a journey of the emotions; there is no room for two.\"\n\nHaggin travels through the woods on horseback. Ren\u00e9 travels through the woods on foot with Red and Mollie--and the four puppies in his backpack. When Red spots a deer and chases it off, Ren\u00e9 remarks that Red loves to hunt but never catches anything. Haggin's path crosses that of a cougar, and his horse is spooked. He tumbles off the horse and down a steep slope into a ravine. The horse runs off. Haggin's foot is trapped under a boulder. The boulder won't budge; his rifle is just out of reach; he's at the mercy of the cougar. With his belt he tries to lasso the rifle, but he grabs a rock when the cougar drops from sight and he hears something approaching. Red appears; the cougar reappears. Red holds the cougar at bay until Ren\u00e9 and Mollie catch up. The cougar lunges from a high rock, but Ren\u00e9 shoots it in midair and it falls dead. Ren\u00e9 uses a limb for leverage against the boulder to free Monsieur. Haggin says he was wrong about Red: \"I said he was irresponsible, but he was ready to get himself killed for me.\"\n\nThen Ren\u00e9 has something he wishes to say: \"I have made many mistakes, Monsieur, and those mistakes were by my own foolishness. I have caused Monsieur much trouble. ... Would Monsieur want me in his employ again, perhaps?\" But Haggin has a better idea, one he figured out on his ride up there: \"You'll live with me at Wintapi, and then you'll go to school.\" Ren\u00e9 is reluctant to accept such a generous offer, but Haggin explains it's an arrangement where both parties benefit--he cares for the boy: \"I came up here because I was worried about you.\" Ren\u00e9 says: \"There is nothing I would like better in the whole world than to stay with you at Wintapi and go to school. Okay?\" Haggin says, \"Okay!\" He needs help walking with his injured foot: \"You tell me if I lean too heavily.\" They walk back to Wintapi with Haggin limping all the way and leaning on Ren\u00e9. By the time they get back, the four puppies have grown enough that they run ahead of the others."

    "Big Trouble": "In a high-school game of Killer (in which a student must shoot another with a squirt gun) Matt Arnold has to \"shoot\" classmate Jenny Herk, and decides to sneak up on her at home. By coincidence hitmen are also there to kill Arthur Herk, who has secretly embezzled money from his company. When the fake assassination attempt crosses paths with the real one, police officers Monica and Walter are called out to the resulting disturbance. Eliot Arnold, Matt's father, who was contacted by Matt's friend, Andrew, immediately feels a mutual attraction to Anne Herk (Jenny's mother), as Matt and Jenny begin to feel attracted to each other as well. The Herks' Mexican housemaid Nina, meanwhile, falls in love with a young man named Puggy, who lives in a tree on their property, after she runs from the shootings and he saves her from the hitmen.\n\nRealizing that he is the intended victim, Arthur visits arms dealers, for a weapon, but ends up with suitcase nuclear bomb. Escaped convicts Snake and Eddie, who were previously kicked out of a bar called the Jolly Jackal for disorderly conduct, hold up the bar and kidnap Arthur and Puggy (who is an employee there) for the suitcase, not knowing its contents.\n\nMeanwhile, Matt tries to \"kill\" Jenny in a mall parking lot, but a security guard thinks that Matt's gun is real. After the guard opens fire on them, Matt and Jenny run to the Herk house, followed by Monica and Walter, who stumble across the confusion. Eliot is called over as well.\n\nThe convicts force Arthur to return to his home, where they capture everyone and tie them up. Taking Puggy and kidnapping Jenny, they leave (with the suitcase) for the Airport. Nina, who was hiding in her room, frees everyone except for Monica and Arthur (who were handcuffed to a heavy brass etagere). Shortly after, the house is visited by two FBI agents who are tracking the bomb. They free Monica and have her lead them to the airport (leaving Arthur, as he was poisoned by a hallucinogenic toad, causing him to think that his dog is possessed by Martha Stewart).\n\nThe criminals reach the plane still holding Jenny hostage. Puggy manages to escape, but the bomb is enabled when going through security; as a condition of them being let through. They made security believe it was a garbage disposal. The FBI agents tell everyone that unless the bomb is retrieved soon, the plane must be shot down. They find Puggy who leads the group to the criminals' plane, which Eliot sneaks onto.\n\nMeanwhile, the two hitmen get out of the traffic jam (caused by Snake and Eddie) and reach the airport. They bump into Officer Romero, and Special Agents Greer and Seitz, knocking the hitmen's Remington Sniper Rifle out of their golf bag in the process. The FBI agents, having more serious problems, leave this to Romero since it's her \"jurisdiction.\" Romero grabs the rifle, and removes its bolt, rendering it useless. She then tosses the rifle down, saying: \"gentlemen\" and leaves. Henry Desalvo remarks to Leonard that Miami sucks...but the cops are kinda nice.\n\nEliot, having sneaked onto the plane, attacks the criminals by knocking Eddie out with a fire extinguisher and blasting the extinguisher at Snake. After being told the suitcase must be gotten off the plane, Eliot hurls it out of the now open plane door, only for Snake to leap after it. In a memorable feat of dumb luck, Snake manages to cling onto some steps still coupled to the plane. Despite Eliot's persistence in trying to convince Snake to release the suitcase, Snake shoots at him, and is then told by the pilot that the suitcase is a bomb, prompting Eliot to pull an emergency lever, decoupling said stairs. Snake (in a nod to the stubborn as a mule tale) plunges into the ocean with a defiant smile, still clinging to the bomb, which explodes safely in the water. Eliot is congratulated by the FBI, promised he will receive presidential cowboy boots and a hat, and told the events that took place will never be acknowledged.\n\nThe last scene reveals what happens to the main characters: After chasing down a plane, subduing two criminals, and saving Miami from a nuclear disaster, Eliot finally won Matt's respect. Anne and Eliot get married, a week after Anne gets divorced from Arthur. Walter, after a forced strip search by idiotic ariport guards, becomes a male stripper. The two hitmen manage to get on a plane out of Miami after a series of very weird events. They claim their Miami job was the lowest point in their careers. However, they're surrounded by the fans of Florida Gators on their plane home; which was a constant joke in the film and unfortunately are delayed on the tarmac due to an obstruction on the runway which happened to be the goats that got released during the traffic jam caused previously by Snake and Eddie. Eddie goes back to jail in a prison outside of Jacksonville, but becomes friends with another dimwitted inmate who shares the same affinity for...crude jokes as Eddie does. Arthur is last seen still handcuffed and tormented by his dog."

    "Big Trouble in Little China": "Truck driver Jack Burton (Kurt Russell) and his friend Wang Chi (Dennis Dun) go to the San Francisco International Airport to pick up Wang's fiancee Miao Yin (Suzee Pai). While at the airport, a Chinese street gang (called the Lords of Death) kidnap Miao Yin and take her into Chinatown intent on selling her as a sex slave.\n\nJack and Wang follow and in the back alleys of Chinatown they get caught in a gang battle when the Wing Kong interrupt a funeral procession the Chang Sing are having for their recently assassinated leader. During the street battle, powerful magicians in league with the Wing Kong, called \"The Three Storms\" (Thunder, Rain, and Lightning) use their supernatural powers to slaughter the Chang Sing. Trying to escape Jack runs over the Wing Kong's leader, the sorcerer Lo Pan (James Hong). However, Lo Pan is not harmed by this and Wang has to help Jack after he is temporarily blinded by Lo Pan's glowing eyes.\n\nJack's truck is then stolen by the Lords of Death. Wang takes Jack to his restaurant 'The Dragon of the Black Pool', where they meet up with lawyer Gracie Law (Kim Cattrall), Wang's friend Eddie Lee (Donald Li) and Egg Shen (Victor Wong), a magician and local authority on Lo Pan who moonlights as a tour bus driver in Chinatown. They come up with a plan to infiltrate the brothel where they think Miao Yin is being held. Once inside Jack (in disguise), starts to question one of the girls, but is interrupted when the Storms crash in and make off with Miao Yin.\n\nBack in Gracie's apartment, they find that Miao Yin was taken to a place called The Wing Kong Exchange, a front for Lo Pan's domain. With Wang's assistance, Jack infiltrates the place and the two get caught in a lift that fills with water. After making their way out, Wang claims they're in \"The hell of the upside-down sinners,\" and they are taken to a cell by Rain, who grabs Wang by the neck, and sends rubber balls to Jack's stomach with force.\n\nAfterwards, they are taken in wheelchairs to see Lo Pan (now in the form of a crippled old man), where he claims that Miao Yin is \"Safer with me than any creature on this Earth\", after telling them of his intent. Lo Pan catches Gracie, Eddie, and Gracie's journalist friend Margo entering the building on his security monitor, and sends Thunder to deal with them. Wang and Jack are taken back to their cell, still in the wheelchairs, when Wang tells Jack about the 2,000 year old legend of Lo Pan; that he was cursed to roam the Earth in a ghost-like form until he can marry a special kind of girl. They break free from the wheelchairs, but hearing Thunder return, they get back into the wheelchairs and put their blindfolds back on. Thunder hangs Eddie up by the collar of his jacket, and Jack jumps Thunder, who manages to push Jack off of him and into his wheelchair, sending him back down the ramp, and nearly into a deep well. Wang and Eddie make a diversion so Jack can rescue the imprisoned girls and get out safely.\n\nUpon reaching the front entrance, Gracie is caught by a monster, and taken to Lo Pan. Both Gracie and Miao Yin tame \"The Burning Blade\" and Lo Pan decides to marry both and sacrifice Gracie, and live out his 'Earthly Pleasures' with Miao Yin. Wang and Jack go to see Egg Shen, and, with the help of the Chang Sings, go into an underground cavern, and eventually into Lo Pan's offices.\n\nEgg gives the group a potion that Jack says makes him feel 'kind of invincible', and when the group get to the ceremony, a huge fight ensues (which Jack inadvertently manages to miss, due to being knocked out with rubble when he fires his gun above his head), with Wang killing Rain in an elegant sword fight. Jack and Gracie head back to the offices to try and catch Lo Pan, the spell having been broken. Wang joins them, and takes on Thunder, while Jack takes on Lo Pan, throwing his knife at him, which embeds into his skull. Thunder sees this and, enraged and dishonored at his failure to protect his Master, starts to inflate to an enormous size without stopping, exploding and killing himself. Jack, Wang, Gracie and Miao Yin are cornered by Lightning in a corridor, which he makes collapse. Egg manages to rescue them by sending down a rope from a hole above them, which Lightning tries climb in order to follow, with Egg throwing down a statue which crushes him.\n\nThey find Jack's truck and make their escape back to The Dragon of the Black Pearl restaurant. With Lo Pan defeated, Egg decides to go on vacation saying China is in the heart, and Jack hits the open road, with an unknown-to-him stowaway.... one of the remaining monsters."

    "Bigil": "Michael Rayappan is a gangster from Royapuram, Chennai who works for the welfare of people in his slum. He has a comical relationship with Angel Aasirvatham, a physiotherapist. Michael has a running feud with a rival gangster named Daniel. One night, Daniel attacks Michael and his close friend Kathir, who is the coach of the Tamil Nadu women's football team. Kathir suffers from injuries during the attack, due to which he in paralysed for a year. To allow the women's football team to take part in the upcoming National Championship in Delhi, Kathir requests the TNFA to replace him with his former teammate named Bigil, who is actually Michael.\n\n7 years ago, Michael was an aspiring footballer, who along with Kathir and his team contributed to victories for the Tamil Nadu football team. His father was Rayappan, a crime boss who had a feud with a rival gangster Alex, Daniel's father. Rayappan encouraged Michael's passion for football as he did not want him to end up as a gangster like him. When Michael was unable to make it to the IFT due to Rayappan's criminal record, Rayappan personally took up the matter with the AIFF president J. K. Sharma and forcefully ensured Sharma to include Michael and Kathir in the Indian team's probable list. Despite Rayappan's efforts, Michael's career was cut short as he witnessed Rayappan getting stabbed to death by Alex and Daniel at the train station, just when he was about to leave for Delhi to attend the selection trial for the Indian football team. Michael kills Alex in front of Daniel, and instead stayed back in Chennai to become the new leader of Rayappan's gang.\n\nIn the present day, Michael confronts Daniel and attempts to kill him for the earlier attack, but the police intervene to arrest Daniel and send him to prison. Michael later accepts Kathir's request to coach the women's football team and leaves for Delhi with Angel and the team. However, due to his criminal background, the girls refuse to cooperate with him, even blaming him for the team's opening loss to Manipur in the National Championship and requesting the Federation to have him removed. Dejected, Michael gives his resignation to Sharma, but soon discovers that Sharma is targeting him in revenge for the humiliation that he had faced at the hands of Rayappan to allow him into the Indian football team and was the one who sent armed assailants to attack Michael before the Manipur football match.\n\nHowever, Michael convinces the girls to support him and starts training them hard with the sole focus of winning the championship. He even manages to bring back two former key players to boost the team's strength: Gayathri, a Brahmin girl who quit playing football after she was married to a conservative family; and Anitha, who is in depression and has refused to even leave her room ever since a boy threw acid on her when she spurned his advances. Angel motivates a pregnant Gayathri to continue playing football. Despite Sharma trying to rig the team's next match against Haryana so that they will be eliminated and sent home, Michael's team manage to beat Haryana and win all their remaining matches, eventually qualifying for the finals at Chennai, where they can play against Manipur again.\n\nOn the eve of the finals, Vembu is kidnapped and forcefully injected with cocaine by Daniel, who is bailed out from prison and hired by Sharma to sabotage the team's chances of winning the championship. Though she recovers, she is unable to play in the final as she would fail the dope test. The team's captain, Thendral, is also kidnapped by Daniel, who attempts to forcefully inject cocaine into her as well; Michael also gets kidnapped by Daniel and gets injected with cocaine. Michael manages to beat Daniel's men and chases Daniel to his house and proceeds to kill him, but when he sees Daniel's young son, he changes his mind and spares Daniel, as he realises he does not want the young boy's future to end up like him by killing Daniel.\n\nThe next day, The Tamil Nadu team plays the final against Manipur. The match turns out to be a thriller with Tamil Nadu winning the Championship through a penalty shootout. Michael and the team dedicate their success to Kathir, who is watching the match from the dugout in a wheelchair. Michael gets Sharma exposed for drug possession, leading to Sharma's arrest and subsequent execution in Malaysia, where he is on a holiday. A few months later, Michael takes up football coaching for children, with one of his students being Daniel's son, who have now made peace with Michael. Michael takes Daniel's son under his wing and ask him who is your favourite football player Messi or Ronaldo where he happily replies Bigil."

    "Biker Boyz": "The story starts off with a race, a race including Smoke, the King of Cali. Alongside him are the other members of his bike gang, the Black Knights, including Kid, a prospect. Kid, whose father is Smoke's mechanic/best friend, is anxious and impatient to start his life as a member of the Black Knights. He wants his father to look at him the same way he looks at Smoke. Kid's dreams are shattered, however, when Smoke's race gets out of hand and his father is hit + killed. Flash forward to a year later, where a now cocky Kid has joined forces with Stuntman. The two have been traveling California, hustling other racers out of their money. After another routine hustle, Kid runs into Smoke, and challenges him to a race. Smoke refuses, stating that Kid needs to join a gang and win some races before he'll be up to his standards. Prompted by Smoke's refusal, Kid forms his own gang -- the Biker Boyz -- with only three members, himself, Stuntman, and Primo, another free lance racer. The three set off, immediately building a following and gaining prospects. Along for the wild ride is Tina, a feisty young woman, who is drawn to Kid by is incessant devotion to her. During an annual party, Kid and Smoke are both enlightened by Kid's mother that Will, the man who raised Kid, is not his real father -- Smoke is. Smoke is shocked, but Kid couldn't be more angry. After fighting with his mother, he leaves home and moves in with Tina, determined to beat out Smoke and the Black Knights. Unable to wait for success, Kid begins hustling again, despite it being against code. After Smoke saves him from being killed by another gang in Fresno, Kid challenges him to a race, the stakes being the end of racing for both of them. The gangs travel to Fresno, where Kid races Dogg. The race ends badly and it looks as if Kid won't be able to race against Smoke the next day, seeing as his bike is totaled. Dogg, however, comes through and lends Kid his bike, with hopes that Kid will beat smoke and put an end to his reign as King of Cali. The next day, the two gangs meet up and set their terms before Kid + Smoke head off to the path they'll be racing on. The race starts normal for Kid, but Smoke has already gone in the zone, everything but the road ahead of him blurring out of vision. Suddenly, Smoke's tunnel of thought is filled with memories, of everything since the night Will was killed. During this, Kid comes into the zone, his mind focusing on nothing other than the road. As the two edge closer to the finish line, Smoke lets up, allowing Kid to beat him. As the movie ends, Kid and Smoke come to an understanding, and Kid allows Smoke to keep his helmet and his right to race."

    "Billy Jack": "Set in the late 1960s, Billy Jack is a half-white, half-Indian ex-Green Beret Vietnam vet-turned-pacifist, and Hapkido expert (a combination of Tae Kwon Do and Aikido) who having gotten in touch with his Native American roots returns from the war to take up residence on a reservation outside a conservative Arizona town, where he quickly becomes the protector of the wild mustangs and the progressive Freedom School run by Jean Roberts, along with the Native Americans on the reservation.\n\nAlong with Roberts and the pupils, Billy Jack has frequent altercations with local bigoted Sheriff Stuart Posner and his son, Bernard, as well as Deputy Sheriff Mike, whose pregnant 15-year-old Barbara had been found in Haight-Ashbury running away from her abusive father, and was brought home. When she arrives, she suffers yet another beating after telling her father what's going on, runs away again, and is found asleep in a field by Billy Jack, who helps hide her at the Freedom School.\n\nAt first Bernard Posner seems like a sympathetic character when he refuses to shoot any of the wild mustangs on the reservation to sell as dog food like his father wants him to, but after helping to cause much trouble for the Freedom School in the hopes of making his father proud of him by harassing female pupils and verbally and physically abusing other Freedom School pupils, especially the Native Americans; raping Roberts, and ultimately shooting and killing Martin, a gentle Native American who befriended Barbara and taught her that there are ways to gain love other than through easy sex, it's clear that Bernard deserves little or no sympathy, although he does admit to wanting to make his father proud despite hating him.\n\nDeputy Sheriff Mike, as well as the Posners and many if not most of the townspeople, hate both non-whites and peace-loving whites. The hatred and resentment grows as it becomes known that the Freedom School is not only open to at-risk kids of all racial/ethnic backgrounds, but is also an unconventional school with few rules.\n\nIn the wake of Martin's murder, as well as the rape of Jean, despite Jean's warnings about the possible resulting dissolution of the Freedom School and harm to its pupils. Billy Jack hunts down Bernard Posner, finds him having sex with a 13-year-old in a shabby hotel room on the edge of town, and orders the girl to leave the premises. Bernard then tries to kill Billy Jack by shooting at him, and Billy Jack, in turn, kills Bernard with a karate chop across the throat.\n\nBilly Jack and Barbara hide from the law in an old church on the edge of town. A shootout between Billy Jack and the law ensues, in which Billy Jack shoots and kills Deputy Mike. Billy Jack, who suffers a gunshot wound to the stomach, stays in the church with Barbara, who is slightly wounded by gunfire. After hiding out in the church all night, Billy Jack finally surrenders to the law and gives himself up, under several conditions:\n\nA) That the Freedom School be allowed to run for the next ten years with no interference, with Jean Roberts beginning a ten-year contract as principal\n\nB) That Jean Roberts gets custody of Barbara and becomes Barbara's legal guardian\n\nC) That an annual press conference be held by the governor's office to report on the school's progress\n\nThe conditions are OK'd by Washington, and, after tearful hugs and goodbyes between him and Jean, Billy Jack allows himself to be handcuffed and taken out to be tried for the killings of Bernard Posner and Barbara's father, Mike. Meanwhile, the kids at the Freedom School gather outside to see Billy Jack off, giving the Black Power raised-fist and shedding tears."

    "Bionicle 2: Legends of Metru Nui": "1000 years (in-universe) before the events of 'Bionicle: Mask of Light', the half-mechanical, half-organic humanoid 'Matoran', and numerous other species, inhabit the six cities of Metru Nui, under the protection of sentinel Toa Lhikan (Michael Dobson), intertribal elder Turaga Dume (Gerard Plunkett), and the deity Mata Nui, the personnification of their world. The inciting action occurs when Lhikan is captured by 'Dark Hunters' Nidhiki (Paul Dobson) and Krekka (Michael Dobson), and empowers the six Matoran Vakama (Alessandro Juliani), Matau (Brian Drummond), Nuju (Trevor Devall), Nokama (Tabitha St. Germain), Onewa (Brian Drummond), and Whenua (Paul Dobson) to take his place as Toa.\n\nThe new Toa set out on a series of adventures (shown only briefly, in a montage), culminating in the recovery of the Great Kanoka Discs, which serve as sources of power. When they present these to the city, the villain Makuta (Lee Tockar), disguised as Dume, humiliates them instead. Onewa, Nuju, and Whenua are captured, but meet with Lhikan in prison, now a Turaga himself, who trains them in their new powers. Vakama, Matau, and Nokama escape, and elude the Dark Hunters in search of their comrades. With the help of the immense, intelligent ungulates known as the 'Kikanalo', these three Toa rejoin their brethren and Lhikan, who reveals the supposed Dume is an impostor, who plans to imprison the entire Matoran population.\n\nThe seven protagonists then expose Makuta, too late to stop him. Makuta, once exposed, strikes Mata Nui unconscious and imprisons the Matoran. Vakama and Lhikan then confront Makuta while the other Toa take the Matoran aboard ship, and set a course to escape. Lhikan is killed in the fight, but Vakama tricks Makuta into stunning himself, and all six Toa immobilize him under a crystal dome. Over a series of voyages (not shown), they settle the Matoran on an island named after Mata Nui, where they become six Turaga to govern the tribes."

    "Bionicle 3: Web of Shadows": "At the beginning of the film, the heroes of 'Bionicle: Legends of Metru Nui', known as the Toa Metru, return to the city of Metru Nui to retrieve their captive fellow-countrymen, the Matoran populace; but are themselves captured by the monstrous, crustacean-like arachnids of the Visorak Horde, and injected with the mutagenic 'Hordika Venom', which changes them into the deformed 'Toa Hordika', and deprives them of most of their powers. They are soon rescued by the hunchbacked, dragonfly-winged Rahaga, whose leader Norik (French Tickner) reveals, the transformation may be undone by the hermit Keetongu (Scott McNeil). Toa Vakama (Alessandro Juliani), however, becomes suborned by the Visorak's commanders, Sidorak (Paul Dobson) and Roodaka (Kathleen Barr), and takes Norik's brethren prisoner.\n\nAfter this, the remaining Toa Hordika follow Norik to Keetongu, who promises to reverse their transformation, after they defeat Roodaka and Sidorak. Four Toa, and Norik, then distract the Visorak while Toa Matau (Brian Drummond) restores Vakama's sanity. Roodaka defeats Keetongu, but allows him to survive, and leaves Sidorak to be killed by him, so as to command the Visorak alone. When she confronts the Toa, Vakama orders the Visorak to disperse, and he and the other Toa use their remaining powers against Roodaka; who in turn uses the resulting discharge of energy to free her imprisoned master Makuta (unvoiced in this film), and escapes with him. With the Visorak gone, Keetongu restores the Toa to their true form.\n\nSoon afterwards, the Toa, the Rahaga, and Keetongu transport the Matoran to the island of Mata Nui, where the Toa become the elders of their six tribes, with the new title and guise of Turaga. The entire story is then narrated by Vakama, in his Turaga form, to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s Toa Takanuva, and the Matoran Jaller and Hahli."

    "Bionicle: Mask of Light": "A brief prologue explains, the half-mechanical, half-organic humanoids known as the Matoran were settled on the island of Mata Nui, by the deity of that name; but subsequently were threatened by his jealous brother, Makuta (Lee Tockar), and only later liberated by six heroes known as the Toa (in reality, a Polynesian title meaning, Battle Commander), while Mata Nui himself remains dormant under the island.\n\nThe story proper begins with two Matoran: the steadfast soldier Jaller (Andrew Francis) and wayward historian/journalist Takua (Jason Michas), who discover the titular 'Mask of Light' while exploring outside their village of Ta-Koro. They are then summoned back to the village by its guardian, Toa Tahu (Scott McNeil), to play for their tribe in an intertribal game of Kohlii (resembling both lacrosse and field-hockey), in which they come a close second to rising player Hahli (Chiara Zanni). After the match, Jaller and Takua reveal the Mask to tribal elders, the Turaga Vakama (Christopher Gaze), Onewa (Dale Wilson), and Nokama (Lesley Ewen), who assign them to seek out its rightful owner, the mysterious Toa of Light. Shortly after their departure, Ta-Koro is ransacked by the Rakshi: a trio of bounty-hunters sent by Makuta. Tahu is contaminated in the process by the Rakshi's poisons, and gradually becomes insane.\n\nUnaware of this, Jaller and Takua enter the jungles of Le-wahi, where they are guided by Toa Lewa (Dale Wilson); and climb the mountains of Ko-wahi, where they are guided by Toa Kopaka (Michael Dobson). At Kopaka's village of Ko-Koro, they are attacked by the Rakshi, whom Kopaka encases in ice. They proceed to the underground road to the cave-city of Onu-Koro, but become separated in the tunnels by Makuta, who frightens Takua into leaving Jaller alone. At Onu-Koro, Takua is attacked by a second trio of Rakshi; these are briefly held at bay by Toa Onua (Scott McNeil) and Toa Pohatu (Trevor Devall). Tahu, Kopaka, Lewa, and Toa Gali (Kathleen Barr) join the fight, but Tahu is poisoned a second time, and turns against his comrades. The Rakshi then ransack Onu-Koro; but Takua escapes, and rejoins Jaller.\n\nIn Le-wahi, Gali, Lewa, and Kopaka cleanse Tahu of the Rakshi's poisons, and all six Toa follow Takua and Jaller to the Great Temple at the center of the island. There, the Toa destroy the Rakshi; but the last Rakshi kills Jaller. Urged by Jaller's last words, Takua assumes the Mask of Light and becomes Toa Takanuva. Mounted on a motorcycle-like aircraft called the Lussanui, Takanuva and Hahli confront Makuta in his lair under the Temple, where Makuta challenges Takanuva to another kohlii match while Hahli assembles the Toa, Matoran, and Turaga. At the climax of the film, Takanuva and Makuta fall into a well of \"Energized Protodermis\" (the substratum of the story's world) and become the colossus 'Takutanuva', who opens the gate into Mata Nui's chamber, beyond Makuta's lair, and revives Jaller. Turaga Vakama then revives Takanuva, and commences a ritual to awaken Mata Nui. This concludes the film."

    "Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)": "The film starts with Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) telling her story from the beginning through an animated intro. As a child, her deadbeat alcoholic dad tried to get rid of her multiple times until he finally dumped her at a Catholic girls school. Harley was always a troublemaker, but she got educated and earned a PhD, becoming a psychologist. That's where she met The Joker and fell in love, leading her to go from Harleen Quinzel to Harley Quinn. However, they have recently broken up since he helped her escape from prison (shown at the end of the previous film 'Suicide Squad'), and despite Harley saying she was fine, she does not take it well and ends up staying alone in a crummy apartment with a hyena she adopted and named Bruce (after Bruce Wayne).\n\nHarley goes to the Black Mask club where she gets plastered (drunk) and annoys a nearby thug who insults her. She ends up smashing his leg, and is told by the club's owner, Roman Sionis/Black Mask (Ewan McGregor), that that was his driver. He does nothing because Harley hasn't told anybody that she and Joker are broken up, since them being a couple gave her immunity from the wrath of Gotham's other thugs. Harley is out with other women whom she overhears saying that she's nothing without Joker and that she'll go running back to him soon enough. Harley decides to challenge this by driving a truck into Ace Chemicals where she and Joker used to stay, obliterating the plant into an explosion of fireworks.\n\nMoments before this, Detective Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez) is investigating what appears to be a mob hit at a restaurant. A flashback shows Helena Bertinelli/Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) killing the men inside with a crossbow, which has earned her the alias, \"The Crossbow Killer.\" Montoya then hears the chemical plant explosion and goes to find Harley's J necklace, which is a clear sign to both cops and criminals that she and Joker are no more, meaning Harley has just declared open season on herself.\n\nAmong the criminals that want Harley dead are Roman and his best friend/right hand man Victor Zsasz (Chris Messina), a psychopath who carves a tally on his body for every one of his victims. They are shown torturing the Keo family and cutting their faces off.\n\nHarley is getting her \"perfect egg sandwich\", but Montoya and a few other pissed off crooks find and go after her. Montoya tackles Harley and causes her to drop her sandwich into the street, which devastated Harley. When it seems like she's cornered, she throws a bag of garbage at Montoya, which blindsides one crook and causes him to shoot an incoming truck-driving crook, allowing Harley to get away. Unfortunately, she runs into a large thug that she and Joker face-tattooed, but before he can get her, he is killed by Helena on her motorcycle. Harley is then surrounded by Roman's thugs.\n\nMontoya returns to the police station where she is mocked by other officers. She meets with Captain Patrick Erickson (Steven Williams), who was her former partner that took credit for her hard work and got promoted, and District Attorney Ellen Yee (Ali Wong), who is also Montoya's ex. She is building a case against Roman but doesn't have much support from either of them. Montoya is then brought to Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco), a young girl brought in for pick pocketing. Montoya then gets a call from Dinah Lance/Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), saying that Cass has a diamond with her. Soon, Harley comes in and tries to go after Cass, but she realizes she is getting ahead of herself in the story.\n\nA week earlier at the club, Roman was telling Mr. Keo (Francois Chau) about the Bertinelli Diamond, which contains codes to their massive fortune and is now in Roman's possession. The diamond was also the reason Helena's whole family was slaughtered. Keo refused to work with Roman, which is what later leads to the demise of him and his family. Dinah works at the club as a singer, noted for her beautiful voice. She later talks to a drunken Harley, who admits to her that she and Joker broke up. Harley then drinks with another man who later tries to abduct her. Dinah sees this and beats up the man and his buddies. Roman observes this from his window and is impressed, and he has Zsasz bring Dinah up so he can hire her as his new driver. This leads Montoya to try and get info from Dinah on Roman, but she refuses to help.\n\nDinah knows Cass because they live in the same building, and Dinah has a soft spot for Cass since she knows she lives with abusive foster parents. Later on, Cass picks Zsasz's pocket and steals the diamond, just before she is arrested for other stuff she stole.\n\nJust after Harley gets away from Montoya, Roman's guys capture her. She knows he had a long list of grievances against her (such as \"voting for Bernie, pronouncing it 'expresso', and calling him Romey\"). Roman smacks Harley around, at which point she has a fantasy about herself as Marilyn Monroe in a \"Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend\" sequence. Before Roman can have Harley killed, he learns from Zsasz that the diamond is gone. Harley offers a chance to recover the diamond, which Roman agrees to. After she leaves, he orders a bounty on Cass.\n\nCut to Harley attacking the police station with colored smoke and confetti bombs. She breaks Cass out but also lets loose other crooks who want to kill her. Harley fights them all on her own, with a little help from Cass, utilizing a baseball bat and lighter, among other things. More goons who want Cass and the diamond shows up, and after inhaling some coke, Harley kills them. She escapes the station with Cass in tow and takes her somewhere safe.\n\nRoman learns that Harley and Cass got away from his goons. He loses his shit and spots a woman, Erika (Bojana Novakovic), in his club laughing, and Zsasz convinces Roman that she is laughing at him. He orders Erika to dance on the table and to take off her dress, going as far as to order her friend to cut it off of her. This shows Dinah just how monstrous Roman is.\n\nHarley learns that Cass swallowed the diamond and goes to a supermarket to buy laxatives, warning her that anyone else will have no problem cutting it out of her. They rob their supplies and go back to Harley's apartment, which is above a Taiwanese restaurant run by Doc (Dana Lee), a kindly man who keeps Harley safe. After Harley and Cass go upstairs, Helena approaches Doc to ask for Harley. Harley then cuts to Helena's backstory: after her family was murdered by mob boss Stefano Galante (Roberto Catrini), one of Galante's goons saw that she survived but took her away to Sicily to stay with his brother and father. They trained Helena to become the killer that she is now. She killed Galante, and the mob guys from earlier were the firing squad that killed her family. Zsasz is the last name on her list.\n\nBack at the police station, Montoya finds out that Yee went behind her back and told Erickson that she stole evidence from a crime scene. Erickson suspends Montoya.\n\nHarley's apartment comes under attack by one of Roman's goons. The place gets blown up, and Bruce goes missing. Harley learns that Doc sold her out to Roman's goons because they paid him well. Harley then contacts Roman and offers to trade Cass in exchange for immunity. He agreed and has Dinah drive Zsasz to meet them, but Zsasz spots a text exchange between Dinah and Montoya to let her know where they are headed. He informs Roman, who becomes upset and puts on his Black Mask.\n\nHarley arranges to be met at an amusement park in a spot called the Booby Trap where she used to hide with Joker. Cass learns about the betrayal as Harley straps her to a toilet so she can pass the diamond. Montoya shows up first and fights Harley, nearly taking her in until Harley uncuffs herself and kicks Montoya out of the building. Dinah and Zsasz show up, but Zsasz hits Harley with a tranquilizer and prepares to kill her. Helena shows up and shoots Zsasz in the neck with an arrow, killing him. The ladies then confront each other until they see Roman show up outside with a whole army of thugs. Knowing that he has a bone to pick with all of them, Harley suggests they team up to fight them all. They reluctantly agree and grab a bunch of old weapons (mallet for Harley, bat for Dinah, brass knuckles for Montoya, etc) and head off to fight. They smash and bash their way through a bunch of goons before Roman manages to kidnap Cass. The ladies are cornered by armed goons until Dinah lets out a supersonic scream to take them down and allow Harley to go after Roman on roller blades.\n\nHarley chases Roman and gets knocked over by other goons. Helena rides by and gives Harley a pull, managing to kill those other goons before causing Roman's car to crash. He takes Cass to the pier and tries to taunt Harley, saying she needs him. She hits back that the criminals in Gotham should fear her, not him or Joker. Before Roman can hurt Cass, she reveals she planted a grenade on him and pulled the pin out. Harley throws Roman off the pier where he explodes into bloody chunks before hitting the water. The others join Harley and Cass, relieved that Roman is now gone.\n\nThe next morning, the ladies gather for tacos and margaritas. Cass goes to pass the diamond, but she and Harley just steal Dinah's car and ride off.\n\nLater on, Erickson once again takes credit for Montoya's work in bringing down Roman and his empire. She quits the GCPD and joins Dinah and Helena to form the Birds of Prey using the money in the Bertinelli accounts.\n\nHarley and Cass pawn the diamond and ride away with Bruce (who turned up alive), with Harley taking Cass on as her apprentice. Harley says she may be a softie, but she dares anyone else to call her that.\n\nAfter the credits:\n\nHarley's voice can be heard getting ready to tell the audience a big secret about Batman... only for the audio to cut off."

    "Biriyani": "The film opens with a car chase involving cops and two friends, Sugan and Parasuram. As their car jumps from the edge of a flyover, the film starts unfolding in flashback. It is shown that Sugan is a womanizer and this attitude gets him into trouble with his reporter girlfriend Priyanka and the childhood friend Parasu who is unable to get a girlfriend due to Sugan's playboy nature. One day, the duo visits a function for opening a branch of one of their offices, where they meet Varadharajan, the chief guest. In the meantime, a CBI officer Riyaz Ahmed has been deputed to track Varadharajan's illegal activities. Due to some error, Priyanka's paper containing questions for Varadharajan gets misplaced and realizing it's partly his fault, Sugan covers for her by interviewing Varadharajan. He tells everyone about him in detail, which impresses Varadharajan who has no idea Parasu is helping him with all the information via internet and an earpiece. Varadharajan is impressed with Sugan and wants to make him his son-in-law, which gets him into an argument with his elder son-in-law Vijaykrishna.\n\nVaradharajan later hosts a cocktail party and invites Sugan who craves biryani after getting drunk and while returning with Parasu, searches for a biryani shop. Finding one, the two stop to eat and Sugan spots an attractive young woman Maya. The two start driving after her and find her car broken down. They decide to give her a ride to her hotel, where she attracts the two men inside, dances with them and gets them drunk. Soon, Varadharajan arrives and it's revealed she's his mistress. Sugan sees him but being heavily drunk, is unable to explain the same to Parasu. The next morning, he wakes up in his car parked outside the Biryani shop and searches for Parasu. He returns to the hotel to find Parasu unconscious with a gun next to him. The duo then find some blood on the bed and as they're trying to flee, cops looking for Varadharajan since his unexpected disappearance nab them. Riyaz meets Vijaykrishna and AC Sampath, Varadharajan's family police officer, and decides to tag along as the latter leaves for the hotel. The cops, on the other hand, try to interrogate the duo, revealing the hotel was booked in Sugan's name and he was caught on camera bringing Varadharajan to the room. Realizing they're being framed, Sugan fights back. A fight ensues, resulting in their escape in the car inside the trunk of which they discover Varadharajan's corpse.\n\nArriving at the crime scene, Sampath and the cops discover the evidence and conclude the friends are the perpetrators. Sugan and Parasu try to think of ways to dispose of the corpse, but run into trouble when the police vehicles chase after them. A huge car chase ensues, during which the two are publicly declared suspects and Varadharajan is considered kidnapped. Near the end of the car chase, the flyover reaches a dead end and their car jumps, leaving behind the cops and escaping. Back to the present time, the duo enlists the help of a friend, and forward Maya's photograph, clicked during her dance, to all their friends. The next day, one friend finds Maya at the Egmore Railway Station, where a female assassin disguised as a cop is ordered to take her out. As she pursues Maya, a flash mob creates public distraction and Sugan takes Maya inside the train, making her reveal she spiked their drinks on the orders of a cop. However, the assassin manages to kill Maya by pushing her in front of a train, and Sugan chases after her. Following a brief hand-to-hand fight, the assassin manages to escape but leaves her phone behind in a rush. Sugan retrieves it and gets it decoded with the help of a friend. They learn she is not a cop but an assassin whose next target is Sugan's sister Varalakshmi. Sugan tries to alert his friend and brother-in-law who are returning from a temple with Varalakshmi. The trio's vehicle is attacked by goons, the men are beaten up badly and Varalakshmi is taken away as Sugan arrives and helplessly chases after the van. However, the goons are ordered to return and get hold of Sugan instead, and this results in another big fight as an enraged Sugan beats up the goons while the assassin flees with the van containing Varalakshmi. Sugan realizes it but in vain. His brother-in-law is admitted to the hospital and somehow manages to survive. Sugan receives a call from Vijaykrishna asking him to hand over Varadharajan in exchange for Varalakshmi's return.\n\nSugan decides to make Parasu impersonate Varadharajan for that to happen. They arrive at the chosen spot, where Sugan and Vijaykrishna start fighting while the assassin fights Sampath. Sugan's friends, lead by Priyanka, discover Varalakshmi and free her along with Riyaz. The plan plays out well when during the fight, Parasu emerges as Varadharajan and fakes his death before telling Viaykrishna he (Parasu) and Sugan are innocent. It is revealed that Vijaykrisha doesn't know anything about Varalakshmi's whereabouts and came because he believes Sugan asked for money in exchange for Varadharajan. Sugan also fights the assassin who is then shot by an officer named ACP Vikram. Sugan and Parasu's names are cleared, but are charged with attacking cops and property. A few days later at Varadharajan's funeral, Sugan learns the truth about Varadharajan's death. Avinash was in love with Varadharajan's daughter for money only, but Sugan and Parasu stopped their love on the way to the new branch opening. Avinash uses his brother to get his love back by bringing Sugan and Parasu using Maya and that Maya used drugs to make Sugan and Parasu very drunk. Then, the assassin comes by killing Maya so that she does not tell the truth to Sugan. Sugan figures out that it was no one other than Vikram, Avinash's brother who was behind everything. Soon Riyaz and Vijaykrishna also find out the truth. Riyaz tells Sugan to kill Vikram, Sugan fights with Vikram, and they both fall from the office into the swimming pool below. What happens to either of them is unknown."

    "Bitch Slap": "Three very different young women; a down-and-out stripper named Trixie (Julia Voth), a violent, drug-running killer and ex-convict named Camero (America Olivo), and a corporate powerbroker nicknamed Hel (Erin Cummings), arrive at a remote desert hideaway to extort massive booty, worth over $200 million in diamonds, from a ruthless underworld kingpin. None of the three women are who they appear to be, and they all have an ulterior motive in looking for the stolen loot. All of them are lesbians, although it is strongly implied that Trixie is bisexual.\n\n18 hours earlier, it is revealed that they have kidnapped a gangster called Gage (Michael Hurst) whom they hold in the trunk of their car and they try to force him to reveal where the treasure is buried. He refuses, believing they will kill him anyway, but Hel promises he will not be harmed. But after he grabs Trixie and tries to use her as a hostage to escape, Camero shoots Gage dead, against the wishes of Hel. Camero tells Hel that she made no such promise to Gage personally. His cell phone rings and they believe Gage is connected to the notorious Pinky. An almost legendary figure Pinky is a sword wielding killer.\n\nThings become more complicated when a police officer arrives. Hel, Camero and Trixie hide the body in the car trunk and are able to convince Deputy Fuchs (Ron Melendez) to leave. Unknown to them, five nights ago, he was in the audience when Trixie performed as a stripper to seduce Gage.\n\nWhile digging for the treasure on the grounds, Camero asks the girls about the best sex they ever had, believing it tells her something important about their character. Trixie tells about having a bisexual three-way at a local carnival, or having sex with a guy in an Amish buggy. Hel refuses to talk, but hints that it may have been with some woman (which implies to be Camero). Camero admits her best sex ever was with a female circus contortionist three months ago, and she did not even know her name. During a water fight, Trixie falls onto something in the sand, they dig but instead of treasure they find a dead body.\n\nThey are interrupted by Hot Wire (William Gregory Lee), a man from Camero's past whom (in more flashbacks to a year ago) where Camero murdered several of his henchmen to steal drugs rather then pay for them. He and his S&M Asian mistress Kinki (Minae Noji) forces them at gunpoint to dig for the treasure. Deputy Fuchs returns and there is a gunfight which Hel ends with a high powered machine gun found earlier in the nearby trailer and guns down both Kinki and Hot Wire.\n\nCamero becomes angry and jealous when she finds Hel and Trixie in a sexual embrace and reveals that she and Hel used to be romanticaly involved when they shared a cell at the state prison several months ago (shown in another flashback) when she was locked up for a series of crimes and evading Hot Wire. It was Hel who persuaded Camero to team up with her and Trixie to find $200 million in diamonds. When Camero becomes too out-of-control, Trixie and Hel are forced to subdue her and tie her up next to the captive Deputy Fuchs while deciding what to do with both of them.\n\nHel is revealed at this point to be an undercover secret agent reporting to a man called Phoenix (Kevin Sorbo), the dead body found in the area. She is on a mission to retrieve a dangerous nano-swarm weapon. Hel finds a concealed bunker full of goods stolen from Pinky including the weapon, the diamonds, and a beautiful sword. Camero thinks she is being double crossed and fights Hel for the diamonds. Camero overcomes Hel, sets fire to Trixie and various barrels of flammable liquids in drums, and leaves her chained up while driving off with the diamonds. Hel frees herself, and using the super machine gun, is able to fire a rocket and blows up the car Camero was escaping in.\n\nHel explains her mission to Trixie and admits that although she is a goverment spy, her love for Trixie is true. Camero returns and has becomes increasingly unstable due to her speed-pill poping. After shooting Trixie in her waste, Camero again fights Hel and manages to stab her and then strangle her, leaving her for dead and moves to kill Trixie. As Trixie will not fight back, Camero attempts to rape her, but stops when she sees a tattoo just below Trixie's navel and realizes Trixie was the mysterious contortionist from her past. (By this time, the joke has become hysterical as all three women have had sexual relations at one point or other with each other; Camero and Hel five months ago, then Hel and Trixie in the present, and Trixie and Camero three months ago).\n\nBefore she can kill Trixie, Camero is shot in the back and killed by Deputy Fuchs who has survived the explosion. Suddenly, Trixie rises and kills him using a hidden throwing star and reveals to the seriously wounded Hel that SHE is Pinky, and was behind the whole setup, which was to retreve her special broadsword used to kill people, as well as to just to mess with people and have her fun. Trixie/Pinky then leaves behind Hel, and escapes in a passing limo with the diamonds and her beautiful sword into the afternoon sunset."

    "Bitten": "Martes (Tuesday): Graveyard shift paramedic Jack (Jason Mewes) attempts to subdue a crazed man by talking him down, but his partner Roger (Richard Fitzpatrick), who has no love for junkies or other low-lives, advises Jack to just zap him with a sedative and have done with it. Jack rationalizes his lapse in protocol on the fact that he's still pining for his ex-girlfriend Sherry, who just ditched him for her yoga instructor. Roger advises Jack to forget Sherry and get some \"new ass.\"\n\nMi\u00e9rcoles (Wednesday): On his way home from work, Jack notices a girl lying in the dumpster behind his apartment house. She is covered with blood and seemingly amnesic because she doesn't remember how she got there. She refuses to go to a hospital, so Jack takes her inside and cleans her up. He notices bite marks on her neck, but she can't remember how she got them or what kind of animal might have made them. She only remembers that her name is Danika (Erica Cox). Jack checks to see whether there have been any reports of a missing person who fit her description but comes up dry. Roger is sure that this \"mystery skank\" is probably cleaning out Jack's apartment as they speak.\n\nViernes (Friday): Danika starts shaking uncontrollably but doesn't know what's wrong. Jack asks Roger to take a look, and Roger concludes that Danika is a junkie. He suggests that Jack take her in for detox, but Jack doesn't believe that Dani's problem is drug-related. Jack's ex, Sherry (Jordan Madley), shows up wanting to collect her clothes and other stuff, but Jack refuses to let her in on the grounds that he's leaving for work. After he's gone, Sherry lets herself in, using her old key, and comes face to face with Danika.\n\nSabado (Saturday): Jack returns from work to find Sherry dead. Dani claims that she can't remember what happened. They begin to make love on the floor, but Jack gets angry when Dani attempts to bite him. \"What's wrong with me?\" Dani moans. Jack notices that she has sprouted fangs and realizes that, during the five days Dani has been living with him, he has never seen her in the sunlight. He pulls her over to a window and opens the curtain a teeny bit. Dani screams, and her arm begins to blister. Pretty sure that he has a vampire on his hands, Jack tidies up the mess and puts Sherry's dried up body in a large crate.\n\nThe next day, when Dani begins to shake again, signaling her need for blood, Jack hunts down a stray cat. It only serves to make Dani sick, so Jack sneaks into the paramedic station and takes a pint of blood from the fridge. When that makes Dani barf, too, Jack realizes that she must have fresh human blood, so he offers his arm. Dani promises to take only a little bit, but Jack has a hard time stopping her once she gets going, and still she begs for more. With no other choices left to him, Jack lures Pusher (Nick Nicotera), the local drug-pushing pimp, into his apartment and lets Dani feed on him. After Jack has again tidied up the mess, they try to stuff Pusher's body into the crate with Sherry, but Sherry suddenly springs to life and attacks Jack. Dani manages to grab a mop and stake her through her chest with the handle. Sherry keeps coming back to life but, after several attempts, Jack finally gets the heart.\n\nWhen Jack returns to work, Roger sends him home to get some sleep. \"You look like the walking dead,\" Roger tells him and advises him to get rid of Danika because she's \"draining\" him, just like a black hole sucking in all the energy until there's nothing left. Jack denies that it's that way with Dani, but he does take Roger's offer and goes home.\n\nMartes: When Jack returns, he finds Dani staring at Sherry's body. She asks him how long they went out together and wonders why things click with some people and not with others. In a tender moment, they begin to kiss, until Dani pushes Jack away. Her fangs are beginning to grow, and she's afraid that she might do harm to him. Knowing that she needs blood again, Jack lures Twitch (Stuart Stone), Pusher's friend and business partner, into his apartment by telling him that Pusher is hurt and calling for him. Dani sates herself on Twitch's blood, leaving Jack to once again tidy up the mess.\n\nMi\u00e9rcoles: Jack is surprised when Dani comes to him all dressed up and wanting to go out partying. Jack refuses because he's afraid that she might end up feeding on someone in public. He falls asleep on the couch and has a dream in which Dani locks him in a box and then plunges a stake through his chest. He is awakened when the telephone rings. It is Roger telling him to get his butt to work, but Jack tells him that he is sick. As he hangs up the phone, Dani walks in with a woman in tow. Dani's intent is to make love to Jack and then feast on Maya (Amy Lynn Grover). After a night of love-making, Jack falls asleep. When he awakens, he finds Maya lying dead next to him and her blood all over the sheets. Jack is livid and swears that he's somehow going to put an end to this because he doesn't want to deal with any more bodies. As they're tidying up the mess and about to put Maya's body in the crate, the landlady suddenly knocks on the door. Mrs Lee (Grace Armas) has come to fix the sink and collect her rent money. When she sees Dani, she assumes that Dani is a hooker, but when she sees the blood on the floor, she gets scared and starts to back away, threatening to call the cops. Suddenly Dani is standing between her and the door, and Dani leaps for Mrs Lee's neck.\n\nViernes: When Jack goes to work on Friday, he is confronted by Roger over the missing unit of blood. Roger is still of the notion that Danika is a junkie and is worried that she's got Jack using, too. He warns Jack that he's throwing his life away by staying with Dani, but Jack won't listen. At quitting time, Roger sends Jack on an errand. While Jack is away, Roger goes over to Jack's apartment to confront Dani. He searches through the garbage until he finds the empty bag of blood and assumes that Jack gave it to Dani as a transfusion. When he starts grilling Dani over her background, Dani gets angry. She's just about to pounce on him when Jack walks in the door. Jack forces Roger to leave. He then locks Dani in the bathroom and goes out for a walk, ending up at Roger's house. Jack asks for Roger's advice on how to break up with Dani. Roger suggests that Jack simply tell her straight out to \"get the f*** out,\" but Jack can't see himself being that crass. It isn't until Roger comments that the way to a woman's heart is \"right through her effin' chest\" that Jack realizes what he must do.\n\nJack returns to his apartment where Dani is still locked in the bathroom. He promises to let her out but says that she must listen to him first. He tells her that he can no longer be involved in this situation, that he has totally lost himself in the relationship, and that he needs some space to find himself again. Dani, realizing that Jack is trying to break up, pleads with him not to leave her. Jack doesn't relent, so she starts to get angry. When Jack, stake in hand, goes to unlock the bathroom door, Dani simply breaks it down from the inside. \"Are you going to try to kill me, now?\" she shouts and bats him across the floor, just as Roger enters the apartment. Jack explains to Roger that Dani is a vampire and that they have to stop her, but Roger doesn't buy it. When he tries to reason with Dani, however, and she bats him across the floor, too, Roger agrees with Jack. Together, they rush Dani, but she grabs Jack and sinks her fangs into his neck. As she is sucking his blood, Roger comes up from behind and plunges the stake through her back...five times in all. In the final scene, Roger cradles Jack's head in his lap and promises that he will take care of him no matter what happens."

    "Black Adam": "Five thousand years ago, the city of Kahndaq was under the tyrannical rule of King Anh-Kot, who intended to create the Crown of Sabbac, which is known to give the wearer great power. After enslaving his people and forcing them to dig for \"Eternium\" - the magical crystal needed to create the crown - a young boy leads the slaves to revolt against him. When the boy is given the power of Shazam, transforming him into Kahndaq's heroic champion Teth-Adam (Dwayne Johnson), he kills Anh-Kot and ends his reign.\n\nIn the present day, Khandaq is oppressed by the Intergang. Archaeologist Adrianna Tomaz (Sarah Shahi) tries to locate the Crown of Sabbac, with the help of her brother Karim (Mohammed Amer), and colleagues, Samir (James Cusati-Moyer) and Ishmael (Marwan Kenzari). As Adrianna obtains the crown, they are ambushed by the Intergang, killing Samir in the process. Adrianna accidentally reads an incantation that awakens Adam from his slumber, who subsequently slaughters most of the Intergang troops. After an Intergang soldier shoots an Eternium rocket at Adam which renders him comatose, it is revealed that Ishmael is an Intergang member who intends to take the crown for himself.\n\nGovernment official Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) learns of the incident and contacts Carter Hall / Hawkman (Aldis Hodge) to assist in taking Adam into custody. Hawkman is accompanied by his fellow members of the Justice Society of America (consisting of Kent Nelson / Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan), Maxine Hunkel / Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell), and Albert \"Al\" Rothstein / Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo)) to stop Adam.\n\nAdrianna sees an inscription on an inner part of the Crown which states \"Life is the only way to Death.\" Adrianna's son Amon sees Adam as Khandaq's hero, but Adam denies it and departs. Wanting to prove to Kahndaq that their champion has reawakened, Amon makes a ruckus with the Intergang, successfully leading Adam to intervene and overpower them. The JSA arrive in time to stop Adam from doing further destruction. As they fight, Fate senses that Adrianna has the Crown of Sabbac. They manage to stop Adam for a while before he flees to the ruins of Anh-Kot's palace. The JSA ask Adrianna to give them the crown, but she declines until they tell her the truth that Adam was the one who lost control of his power five thousand years ago and destroyed most of Khandaq.\n\nThe crown is given to Amon, who takes it back home. Ishmael is there with Karim and reveals his true colors. Amon runs away from Ishmael, who shoots and wounds Karim and chases Amon. Meanwhile, Adrianna and the JSA meet Adam and attempt to convince him that he can be a hero to Khandaq before Amon calls Adrianna, who pleads to Adam to save him. Adam immediately comes to the rescue, but Ishmael manages to abduct Amon and flees on an Eternium bike. Adam tries to rescue Amon by dealing with the Intergang on bikes to no avail. As Adam goes back to Adrianna's home, Hawkman manages to capture two Intergang members and interrogate them about their hideout. Adam uses brute force to interrogate both of them and learns where the Intergang's hideout is, but his way of interrogation enrages Hawkman. As Adam and Hawkman fight, they find that Amon hid the Crown of Sabbac in plain sight. They intend to use the Crown to trade with Amon and must fight side by side to save him. On their way, Fate reveals to Hawkman his premonition about Hawkman's death.\n\nThey reach Ishmael, who reveals that he is the last descendant of King Anh-Kot and, wanting his rightful place on the throne, demands the crown, which Adrianna willingly gives to save Amon's life. Unfortunately, Ishmael betrays his part of the deal by shooting Amon and putting the crown on himself. As Adam tries to save Amon, he loses control again and destroys the hideout with his power, until the JSA protects Amon and Adrianna as Ishmael dies in the process.\n\nGuilt-ridden, Adam flees to the ruins again. There, he reveals to Hawkman that it was actually Hurut (Jalon Christian), his son, who was Khandaq's champion; knowing that Hurut was invincible, the king's men executed Hurut's family instead, killing Isis and mortally wounding Adam in the process. Hurut gave his power to Adam to save him, but Anh-Kot's archer managed to kill the now-powerless Hurut. Enraged, Adam slaughtered all of the king's men, before he was summoned by the wizards of Shazam, who imprisoned him after deeming him unworthy. Feeling incapable of becoming Khandaq's champion and protecting it, Adam then surrenders to the JSA, who take him to Waller's underwater prison. Soon after, Fate continues to see the ominous premonition. It is later revealed that Ishmael intentionally made Adam kill him so that he can be reborn as Sabbac, which he succeeds in doing, and arises from the underworld to Khandaq to claim his throne.\n\nThe JSA arrive in time to try to stop Sabbac, who summons the undead to Khandaq. Adrianna and Amon fight them, with Karim joining them. Amon asks for the people of Khandaq to fight together against the undead for Kahndaq's freedom.\n\nThe JSA prepare to face Sabbac in Anh-Kot's ruins. However, Fate creates a magical force field that forbids Hawkman, Cyclone, and Atom Smasher from coming into the ruins and reveals that Hawkman's death can be avoided, with Fate's sacrifice. Fate then fights Sabbac alone, and at the same time uses astral projection to release Adam from his suspended animation so Adam can help them. Adam manages to escape the prison, but Sabbac kills Fate. Fate's death causes the force field to disappear, allowing Hawkman, Cyclone, and Atom Smasher to try to fight Sabbac, who overpowers them. Just as he is about to kill the JSA, Adam arrives, and engages Sabbac, but is slowly losing as Sabbac's power can harm him. Hawkman uses Fate's helmet to create magical duplicates and spells, having learned from Fate, to help Adam kill Sabbac, ultimately stopping the undead.\n\nThe JSA depart on good terms with Adam, who accepts his new role as protector of Khandaq rather than its ruler. In a mid-credits scene, Waller communicates with a defiant Adam, warning him about forces ready to stop him, before he is confronted by Superman (Henry Cavill)."

With the bulk of the peacekeepers withdrawn by 1993, the Somali militia have declared war on the remaining UN personnel. In response, United States Army Rangers, Delta Force, and 160th SOAR are deployed to Somalia to capture Mohammed Farrah Aidid, self-proclaimed president of the country. Outside Mogadishu, Rangers and Delta Force operatives capture Osman Ali Atto, a warlord selling arms to the militia of Aidid. Shortly thereafter, a mission is planned to capture Omar Salad Elmi and Abdi Hassan Awale Qeybdiid, two of Aidid's top advisers. The US forces include experienced men as well as new recruits, including PFC Todd Blackburn and a desk clerk going on his first mission. When his Lieutenant is removed from duty as the result of a seizure, Staff Sergeant Matthew Eversmann is placed in command of Ranger Chalk Four, his first command.\n\nThe operation is launched and Delta Force successfully captures Aidid's advisers inside the target building, but the Rangers and helicopters escorting the ground-extraction convoy take heavy fire, while SSG Eversmann's Chalk Four is dropped a block away by mistake. When Blackburn is severely injured after falling from one of the Black Hawk helicopters, three HMMWVs led by SGT Jeff Struecker are detached from the convoy to return Blackburn to the UN-held Mogadishu Airport. SGT Dominick Pilla is shot and killed just as Struecker's column gets underway, and shortly thereafter a black hawk, call sign Super-Six One, piloted by CW3 Clifton \"Elvis\" Wolcott, is shot down by a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) and crashes deep within the city. Wolcott and his co-pilot are killed, the two crew chiefs are wounded, and one mortally wounded Delta sniper on board escapes in another helicopter that makes it back to base. The ground forces are rerouted to converge on the crash site, but the Somali militia throw up roadblocks, forcing LTC Danny McKnight's Humvee column off it's planned route, while sustaining heavy casualties.\n\nMeanwhile, two Ranger Chalks, including Eversmann's unit, reach Super-Six One's crash site, setting up a defensive perimeter to await evacuation with the two wounded men and the fallen pilots. In the interim, call sign Super-Six Four, piloted by CW3 Michael Durant is also shot down by an RPG, crashing several blocks away.\n\nWith CPT Mike Steele's Rangers pinned down and sustaining heavy casualties, no ground forces can reach Super Six Four's crash site, nor reinforce the Rangers defending Super Six One. Two Delta snipers, SFC Randy Shughart and MSG Gary Gordon are inserted by helicopter to Super Six Four's crash site, where they find Durant still alive. Despite a valiant effort to defend the downed Black Hawk, the crash site is eventually overrun, Gordon and Shughart are killed, and Durant is captured and taken to Aidid. McKnight's column gives up the attempt to reach Six-One's crash site, and returns to base with their prisoners and the casualties. The men prepare to go back to extract the pinned down Rangers and the fallen pilots and MG Garrison orders the 10th Mountain Division, including Malaysian and Pakistani forces, to mobilize as a relief column.\n\nAs night falls the Somali militia launch a sustained assault on the trapped Americans at Super Six One's crash site. The militia is held off throughout the night by strafing runs and rocket attacks from AH-6J Little Bird helicopter gunships of the Nightstalkers, until the 10th Mountain Division's relief column is able to reach the site. The wounded and casualties are evacuated in the vehicles, however extracting the bodies of Cliff Wolcott and his co-pilot from the downed Black Hawk turns out to be more involved and the column is forced to stay for nearly four more hours. After everyone and any dead soldiers are secured in the vehicles, the convoy leaves. When space inside the vehicles runs short, a handful of remaining Army Rangers and Delta operatives are forced to run from the crash site back to the stadium, in the UN Safe Zone, a journey dubbed the \"Mogadishu Mile\" by those who ran.\n\nThe closing credits detail the results of the raid: 19 American soldiers were killed, with over 1,000 Somalis dead. Durant was released after 11 days of captivity. Delta snipers Gordon and Shughart were the first soldiers to be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor since the Vietnam War. On August 2, 1996, Aidid was killed in a battle with a rival clan. General Garrison retired from active duty the following day."

    "Black Moon Rising": "Sam Quint (Tommy Lee Jones) is a former thief hired by the FBI to steal a computer disk which contains incriminating evidence against The Lucky Dollar Corporation of Las Vegas. After stealing the disk, Quint is pursued by Marvin Ringer (Lee Ving), another former thief and acquaintance who works for the company. At the same time, a prototype vehicle called the Black Moon, which can reach speeds of 325 MPH and runs on tap water, is being tested in the desert by Earl Windom (Richard Jaeckel). Quint and Windom later cross paths at a gas station, where Quint hides the disk in the back bumper of the Black Moon. Windom is hauling the Black Moon to Los Angeles, and Quint, still being pursued by Ringer and his men, follows Windom and his team there.\n\nNow in L.A., Quint meets with FBI agent Johnson (Bubba Smith), and he demands double pay and a clean passport because he is now dealing with Ringer. Afterward, Quint tracks down Windom and the Black Moon at a posh restaurant, where Windom is negotiating a deal to sell the prototype to a car manufacturer. Before Quint can get to the disk, a group of auto thieves, led by Nina (Linda Hamilton), steals all of the cars in the parking lot, including the Black Moon off of its trailer. Quint gives chase, and tracks the cars to an office tower, but loses them in the parking garage. Inside the garage, Quint is seen on the security cameras, but nobody recognizes him. Back at the restaurant, Quint meets Johnson again. Johnson says he needs the disk in three days or the government's case against The Lucky Dollar will be thrown out of court. He also tells Quint that if he fails to deliver the disk, he won't get paid. Quint then goes to Windom and his team and asks for their help in getting the car back, but they refuse, insisting that they go to the police first.\n\nAfter getting the blueprints for the towers from city hall, Quint begins staking them out. The Nyland Towers are a pair of office buildings built by Ed Nyland (Robert Vaughn), who is also the head of the stolen car syndicate. The basement of the towers is a large chop shop, and Nyland keeps the best cars for himself and sells the rest. He scolds Nina for stealing a car he can't possibly resell nor does he want it, but he also won't allow Nina to keep it for herself. After seeing Nina leave the towers, Quint follows her to a nightclub. At the club, they meet and go to her apartment. They have sex, then he tells her that he wants the funny looking car back and he wants her to help. She doesn't say no, but doesn't say yes either. Later, Windom and his team go to the towers to look for evidence to give to the police. Nyland's goons kill one of the team members, so they go back to Quint and offer their assistance. Meanwhile, Ringer has tracked down Quint, and he and his men attack him, demanding the return of the disk. Quint is able to kill two of the henchmen, but Ringer gets away.\n\nThe next day, Nina is summoned by Nyland. He shows her the tape of Quint outside of the garage, and she says she doesn't know him. He then shows her a tape of them having sex. He calls her a traitor and has her locked in a closet, to be dealt with later. Meanwhile, Quint and Windom determine that since the chop shop entrance is impenetrable from the garage, the best way to get in is through the unfinished, unsecured second tower. While Windom knocks out the security cameras, Quint goes up the empty tower, crosses over to the other one, and heads down. While descending down a ventilation shaft, he discovers Nina in the locked closet and gets her out. She then agrees to help Quint steal the Black Moon. After knocking out a guard and stealing his uniform, Quint and Nina enter the chop shop and take the Black Moon. Nyland has since learned that Nina is no longer locked up and sees her in the garage. Windom is on the other side of the garage door and blows a hole in it with C-4, but emergency bars drop down to cover the hole in the door before Quint and Nina can escape and are trapped.\n\nQuint drives the Black Moon into the freight elevator, which takes them to Nyland's office. During the chase on that floor, Nina activates the turbo boost that makes the car go 325 MPH. The car then shoots towards a window, hitting and killing Nyland instantly. The car then goes through the window and flies into the unoccupied building. Just as they think they are safe and Quint gets the disk out from the bumper, Ringer shows up and takes the disk. He and Quint start fighting just as Agent Johnson shows up. After a brutal fistfight, Quint knocks out Ringer and takes back the disk and gives it to Johnson. Quint then takes his money from him and says he is officially retired from working with the FBI. Windom then shows up and is grateful his car is still in one piece, but wonders how they will get it down. The movie ends back at Nina's apartment, where Quint asks her if she is happy she stole the Black Moon. After she says yes, he says that he is too."

    "Black Panther": "Centuries ago, five African tribes war over a meteorite containing Vibranium. One warrior ingests a \"heart-shaped herb\" affected by the metal and gains superhuman abilities, becoming the first \"Black Panther\". He unites all but the Jabari Tribe to form the nation of Wakanda. The Wakandans use the Vibranium to develop advanced technology and isolate themselves from the world by posing as a Third World country. The erected a camouflage energy shield around their country. The Jabari tribe lived in the mountains ever since.\n\nIn 1992, King T'Chaka (Atandwa) visits his brother N'Jobu (Sterling K. Brown), who is working undercover in Oakland, California. T'Chaka accuses N'Jobu of assisting black-market arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) (A South African black-market arms dealer, smuggler and gangster, who is allied with Killmonger. He uses a piece of advanced Wakandan mining equipment as a sonic Disruptor arm-cannon, replacing his left arm, which he lost in Avengers: Age of Ultron) with stealing Vibranium from Wakanda. Klaue stole 0.25 tons of Vibranium and knew exactly where it was stored and how to get it out of Wakanda. N'Jobu's partner reveals he is Zuri (Forest Whitaker) (An elder statesman in Wakanda, and the keeper of the heart-shaped herb), another undercover Wakandan, and confirms T'Chaka's suspicions. N'Jobu is ordered to return to Wakanda and face punishment for his crimes.\n\nIn the present day, following T'Chaka's death, his son T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) (The king of the African nation of Wakanda, who gains enhanced strength by ingesting the Heart-Shaped Herb. After the events of Captain America: Civil War, and the death of his father T'Chaka, T'Challa is in mourning while ascending to the throne) returns to Wakanda to assume the throne.\n\nHe and Okoye (Danai Gurira) (An \"extremely proud\" Wakandan and traditionalist from the Border Tribe, who is the head of the Dora Milaje, the all-female special forces of Wakanda, who serve as T'Challa's bodyguards), the leader of the Dora Milaje regiment, extract Nakia (Lupita Nyong'O), T'Challa's ex-lover, from an undercover assignment (against an organized group of Nigerian women-traffickers) so she can attend his coronation ceremony with his mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett) and younger sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) (T'Challa's 16-year-old sister and the princess of Wakanda who designs new technology for the country).\n\nAt the ceremony, the Jabari Tribe's leader M'Baku (Winston Duke) (A powerful, ruthless warrior who is the leader of Wakanda's mountain tribe, the Jabari, who are in protest to T'Challa being the new king) challenges T'Challa for the crown in ritual combat. T'Challa defeats M'Baku and persuades him to yield rather than die. That night T'Challa is given a mix made up of the heart shaped herbs to give him powers of the Black Panther. The herb connects the soul to the Astral plane, where T'Challa is able to meet the soul of his father T'Chaka. Nakia wants Wakanda to help the needy around the world, but T'Challa wants to protect Wakanda's secrets and technology.\n\nAfter Klaue and Erik Stevens (Michael B. Jordan) (The son of N'Jobu, and a U.S. black-ops soldier who seeks to overthrow his cousin T'Challa) steal a Wakandan artifact from a London Museum.\n\nOkoye gets intelligence reports that Klaue plans to sell the Vibranium from the artifact to an American buyer in South Korea, in one day's time. W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya), T'Challa's friend and Okoye's lover, urges him to bring Klaue back dead or alive. Shuri designs a new Black Panther suit for T'Challa. The suit absorbs kinetic energy and then holds it in place for redistribution. T'Challa, Okoye, and Nakia travel to an underground casino in Busan, South Korea, where Klaue plans to sell the artifact to CIA agent Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman). A firefight erupts and Klaue attempts to flee but is caught by T'Challa after a lengthy chase through Busan. T'Challa reluctantly releases him to Ross' custody.\n\nKlaue tells Ross that Wakanda's international image of a poor third world country is a front for a technologically advanced civilization. Klaue says that he is the only outside who has ever seen the Wakanda Vibranium mine, and there is a whole mountain of it. Erik attacks and extracts Klaue (He tracks Klaue from the energy signature from Klaue's arm cannon which is powered by Vibranium) as Ross is gravely injured protecting Nakia. Rather than pursue Klaue, T'Challa takes Ross to Wakanda, where their technology can save him. Erik gets back to normal in a day, and witnesses the true extent of Wakandan technology.\n\nWhile Shuri heals Ross, T'Challa confronts Zuri about N'Jobu. Zuri explains that N'Jobu planned to share Wakanda's technology with people of African descent around the world to help them conquer their oppressors. N'Jobu then wanted Wakanda to rule all countries in the world since Wakanda would control the supply of Vibranium. As T'Chaka arrested N'Jobu, N'Jobu attacked Zuri, forcing T'Chaka to kill him. T'Chaka ordered Zuri to lie that N'Jobu had disappeared and left behind N'Jobu's American son, Erik, in order to maintain the lie that N'Jobu was nowhere to be found. Erik became a U.S. black ops soldier, adopting the name \"Killmonger\". In reality Erik has a claim to the throne as well, since he is of royal blood.\n\nMeanwhile, Killmonger kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda. He is brought before the tribal elders, revealing his identity and claim to the throne. Killmonger challenges T'Challa to ritual combat; after killing Zuri, he defeats T'Challa and hurls him over a waterfall. After ingesting the heart-shaped herb, Killmonger orders the rest incinerated, but Nakia extracts one first. Killmonger, supported by W'Kabi and his army, prepares to distribute shipments of Wakandan weapons to operatives around the world.\n\nNakia, Shuri, Ramonda and Ross flee to the Jabari Tribe for aid. They find a comatose T'Challa, rescued by the Jabari in repayment for sparing M'Baku's life. Healed by Nakia's herb, T'Challa returns to fight Killmonger, who dons his own Black Panther suit and commands W'Kabi and his army to attack T'Challa. Shuri, Nakia, and the Dora Milaje join T'Challa, while Ross remotely pilots a jet and shoots down the planes carrying the Vibranium weapons. M'Baku and the Jabari arrive to reinforce T'Challa. Confronted by Okoye, W'Kabi and his army stand down. Fighting in Wakanda's Vibranium mine, T'Challa disrupts Killmonger's suit and stabs him. Killmonger refuses to be healed, choosing to die a free man rather than be incarcerated.\n\nT'Challa establishes an outreach center at the building where N'Jobu died to be run by Nakia and Shuri. In a mid-credits scene, T'Challa appears before the United Nations to reveal Wakanda's true nature to the world. In a post-credits scene, Shuri helps Bucky Barnes with his recuperation"

    "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever": "T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), king of Wakanda, is dying from an unspecified terminal illness which his sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) (The princess of Wakanda who designs new technology for the nation) believes can be cured by the \"heart-shaped herb\". Shuri attempts to synthetically recreate the herb after it was destroyed by Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), but fails to do so before T'Challa dies.\n\nOne year later, Wakanda is under pressure from other nations to share their Vibranium, with some parties attempting to steal it by force. Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) (The Sovereign Queen regnant of Wakanda who is grieving the death of her son T'Challa) implores Shuri to continue her research on the herb, hoping to create a new Black Panther that will defend Wakanda, but she refuses due to her belief that the Black Panther is a figure of the past. In the Atlantic Ocean, the CIA and U.S. Navy SEALs utilize a Vibranium detector to locate a potential Vibranium deposit underwater. The expedition is killed by a group of blue-skinned, water-breathing super-humans led by Namor (Tenoch Huerta Mej\u00eda) (The king of Talokan, an ancient civilization of underwater dwelling people. Namor decides to get involved in the surface world after T'Challa publicly reveals the truth of Wakanda at the end of the first film, which consequently puts Talokan in \"jeopardy\", leading Namor and his people to \"take action to protect themselves\"), with the CIA believing Wakanda to be responsible. Namor confronts Ramonda and Shuri, easily bypassing Wakanda's advanced security. Blaming Wakanda for the Vibranium race, he gives them an ultimatum: deliver him the scientist responsible for the Vibranium detector, or he will attack Wakanda. Namor claims to have a massive army with incomparable strength.\n\nShuri and Okoye (Danai Gurira) (The general of the Dora Milaje, Wakanda's all-female special forces) learn from CIA agent Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman) that the scientist in question is MIT student Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne) (An MIT student and genius inventor from Chicago who creates a suit of armor that rivals the one built by Tony Stark / Iron Man) and arrive at the university to confront her. Shuri tells Everett that Wakanda had nothing to do with the attack on the mining expedition. The group is pursued by the FBI and then by Namor's warriors, who defeat Okoye before taking Shuri and Williams underwater to meet Namor. Angered by Okoye's failure to protect Shuri, Ramonda strips her of her title as general of the Dora Milaje (and for siding with the KillMonger when he took over the throne of Wakanda) and seeks out Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) (A former War Dog, an undercover spy for Wakanda, from the River Tribe), who has been living in Haiti since The Blip\n\nRamonda contacts Everett, but refuses to divulge that it was Namor who abducted Riri. Everett and the CIA believes that it was the Wakandans again.\n\nNamor shows Shuri his Vibranium-rich underwater kingdom of Talokan, which he has protected for centuries from discovery by the world. Namor says that he comes from the Yucatan peninsula. In 1571 AD, the Spanish conquistadors brought disease and war. Their shaman was given a vision of a different world, and led to a blue plant growing in a rock. The shaman takes the plant and grinds it into a paste, that is taken by all natives, including Namor's mother who was pregnant at the time. The plant took away their ability to breathe air, but gave them the ability to draw oxygen from water. Namor was born in the water and the plant gave him wings on his ankles and ears that pointed to the clouds. He was a mutant. Namor returned to bury his mother in her homeland and killed the European settlers. The Christian priest calls him a demon, a child without love, or Namor. Nakia tracks down Shuri to the same spot where the shaman entered the water world for the first time.\n\nBitter at the surface world for enslaving the Maya, Namor proposes an alliance with Wakanda against the rest of the world but threatens to destroy Wakanda if they refuse. Nakia helps Shuri and Williams escape, killing a Talokanil guard in the process, and Namor retaliates with an attack against Wakanda, during which Ramonda drowns while saving Williams. Namor vows to return with his full army in one week's time, and the citizens of Wakanda relocate to the Jabari mountains for their safety. Meanwhile, Ross is arrested by his ex-wife, CIA director Valentina Allegra De Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), for secretly exchanging classified intelligence with the Wakandans.\n\nAfter Ramonda's funeral, Shuri uses a remnant of the herb that gave Namor's people their superhuman abilities to reconstruct the heart-shaped herb. She was able to do this with the bracelet that Namor gifted her, which contained the remnant of the plant that their Shaman had found in 1571 AD. Together Riri and Shuri figure out that Namor derives his strength from the water. He can be weakened if dried out. She ingests it, gaining superhuman abilities (but going into cardiac arrest in the process) and meeting Killmonger in the Ancestral Plane, who urges her to seek revenge. Shuri dons a new Black Panther suit and is accepted by the other Wakandan tribes as the Black Panther. Despite M'Baku's (Winston Duke) (A powerful warrior and leader of Wakanda's mountain tribe, the Jabari) urges for peace, Shuri is determined to exact vengeance on Namor for Ramonda's death and orders an immediate counterattack on Talokan. Preparing for battle, with Ayo assuming the position of general of the Dora Milaje, Shuri bestows the Midnight Angel armor upon Okoye, who in turn recruits Dora Milaje member Aneka (Michaela Coel) (A Wakandan warrior and member of the Dora Milaje) to join her. Williams creates an Iron Man like powered exoskeleton to aid the Wakandans.\n\nUsing a seafaring vessel, the Wakandans lure Namor and his warriors to the surface with another Vibranium detector as a battle ensues. Shuri traps Namor in a fighter aircraft, intending to dry him out and weaken him. The pair crash on a desert beach and fight. Shuri gains the upper hand, but has a vision of Ramonda and implores Namor to yield, offering him a peaceful alliance. Namor accepts, and the battle ends. Namor's cousin, Namora (Mabel Cadena), is upset at Namor's surrender, but he assures her that the new alliance will allow them to conquer the surface world one day. Williams returns to MIT, leaving her suit behind, while Okoye rescues Ross from captivity. Shuri plants more heart-shaped herbs to ensure the future of the Black Panther mantle. In Shuri's absence, M'Baku steps forward to challenge for the throne. Shuri visits Nakia in Haiti where she burns her funeral robe in accordance with Ramonda's wishes, allowing herself to finally grieve for T'Challa.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Shuri learns that Nakia and T'Challa had a son named Toussaint, whom Nakia has been raising in secret. Toussaint reveals his Wakandan name is T'Challa."

    "Black Rain": "Nick Conklin (Michael Douglas) is a skilled motorcyclist and a tough veteran New York City police officer facing possible criminal charges; Internal Affairs believes Nick was involved with his partner who was caught taking criminal money in a corruption scandal. Nick is divorced from his wife, who has custody of their two children. Nick also has financial difficulties due to alimony and child support as well as other concerns.\n\nNick reports to a criminal investigation hearing being run by two officers from Internal Affairs, a conference that doesn't go well for him. They ask Nick about his involvement with several officers under investigation. When Nick refuses to squeal on his comrades, Internal Affairs threatens him, suggesting he's as corrupt as the others in the department.\n\nWhile having a drink at a local Italian restaurant/bar, Nick and his partner Charlie Vincent (Andy Garcia) observe two Japanese men having what appears to be a friendly lunch with some Italian gangsters. Nick is increasingly suspicious of the group until another Japanese man enters the restaurant with several armed henchmen and seizes a small package at gunpoint from the leader of the Japanese. As the man turns to leave, one of the Japanese men at the table says, in Japanese, \"The Oyabun [Godfather] will not stand for this.\" The leader of the Japanese group chimes in, \"As always, such a troublesome child.\" The Japanese man finds these remarks insulting and he stabs one of them in the chest, slashes the other's throat and then walks out. Nick and Charlie follow immediately and, after a short chase, arrest the suspect after he nearly kills Nick in a nearby slaughterhouse.\n\nThe suspect turns out to be a Yakuza gangster by the name of Sato (Yusaku Matsuda). The situation is further complicated when Nick's superior officer, Captain Oliver (John Spencer), tells him that Sato is to be extradited to Osaka and given to the police there. Nick is angry that Sato will not be tried for murder in the United States, but agrees to escort him to Japan. Nick's captain also has an ulterior motive for sending Nick overseas; he believes the excursion will keep Nick from causing more trouble and exacerbating the already biased Internal Affairs investigation of him.\n\nOn the long flight to Japan, Nick and Charlie talk about Nick's situation and how Nick's own expenses are beyond his means to pay them. At one point, while Charlie is out of his seat, Sato notices Nick cheating at solitaire and contemptibly chuckles to himself. Nick cruelly hits his prisoner in the mouth and lies about it when Charlie returns and asks what happened.\n\nWhen they arrive in Osaka, men identifying themselves as Japanese police immediately meet them on the plane, display a \"transfer document\" printed in Japanese and take Sato into their custody, leaving the plane by the rear exit. As Nick and Charlie are about to get off the plane themselves, another group of police enter from the front and identify themselves in English, indicating that the first \"cops\" were impostors.\n\nNick and Charlie are taken to the headquarters of the Osaka Prefecture of Police and questioned. They are also blamed for Sato's escape. After much haranguing by Nick (who shows xenophobia) towards the Japanese, who rarely acknowledge that they can speak English, he and Charlie are allowed to observe the hunt for Sato. However, the senior police officer, Ohashi (Shigeru K\u00f4yama) emphasizes that they have no authority in Japan and it is illegal for them to carry their guns, which are confiscated. They are assigned to Masahiro Matsumoto (Takakura), a mild-mannered and experienced officer, who will be their guide.\n\nThroughout the investigation Nick behaves rudely, offending Matsumoto, while Charlie tries to be more polite. Taken to a murder scene at a local nightclub, Nick recognizes the murder victim as one of the men at the airport who took Sato into custody. While the dead man is examined by forensics experts, one of them removes a $100 bill from his mouth.\n\nNick makes contact with an American blond nightclub hostess, Joyce (Kate Capshaw), who explains that the Japanese public, including the giggling hostesses in the club, all believe that Nick and Charlie are not to be taken seriously because they allowed Sato to easily escape from custody, and represent American inefficiency and stupidity. Through Joyce, Nick discovers that Sato is fighting a gang war with a notorious crime boss, Sugai (Tomisaburo Wakayama). Sato used to be a lieutenant for Sugai and now wants his own territory to rule. Sato had traveled to New York to disrupt a meeting with American Italian gangsters about a scheme being set up by Sugai involving the package Sato had taken in the restaurant. When they leave the club, Matsumoto offers to drive them back to their hotel; Nick and Charlie turn him down and Nick demands that all reports about Sato's escape and what they saw in the club be translated and given to him the next morning. As they walk back toward their hotel, they're suddenly surrounded and harassed by some of Sato's bosozoku motorcycle gang. Nick is mostly unfazed when Charlie tells him they should cut their losses and go back to New York.\n\nNick and Charlie join a raid on one of Sato's hideouts without permission, goading Matsumoto into joining them. Nick takes some $100 bills from a table, a sly move that is noticed by Matsumoto. Matsumoto takes the blame for bringing Nick and Charlie on the raid from Ohashi. The next day Matsumoto explains they have dishonoured themselves, him and the police force by this theft, which has been reported back to America; Nick angrily claims he ought not to have \"snitched\" to his superiors, and demonstrates the forgery in Ohashi's office. He suggests that the package stolen by Sato was either more samples of the forged bills or plates to make more and storms out.\n\nLate one night, after spending a few hours in a nightclub with Matsumoto, Nick and Charlie walk back to their hotel slightly drunk and unescorted, despite previous warnings about their safety from Matsumoto. They are harassed by a young punk on a motorcycle, and it seems to be a joke until the motorcyclist steals Charlies raincoat and lures Charlie into an underground parking garage. Nick follows, shouting for Charlie to come back, but is separated from his partner by a security gate. The unarmed Nick then watches in horror as Sato and several of his bosozoku gang members briefly torture Charlie using swords and knives, before Sato appears and beheads him. Distraught, Nick is comforted by Joyce at her apartment. Matsumoto arrives with Charlie's belongings, including his NYPD badge, which Nick gives to Matsumoto, and Charlie's service pistol, which Nick keeps for himself.\n\nMatsumoto and Nick trail one of Sato's operatives, a well-dressed young woman; overnight the policemen discuss their different cultures, and Nick admits to Matsumoto that he had taken some money in New York, where he says there is no \"black-and-white\" procedure, only \"gray\" areas. Matsumoto disagrees, saying \"theft is theft\" and that Nick's illegal action disgraces himself and Charlie. Nick realizes Matsumoto is right and humbly accepts Matsumoto's advice. In the morning the woman retrieves from a bank strongbox a sample counterfeit note (printed only on one side) which she passes to one of Sato's gang on the street. Nick and Matsumoto tail the man to a steel foundry where they find Sato meeting with Sugai, and discover that the package that Sato had stolen in New York contains one of the printing plates for the American $100 bill. Nick intervenes when Sato leaves the meeting and a gunfight ensues. Sato escapes again when Nick is arrested by the swarming police for using a gun in public, and told he will be sent back to New York in disgrace.\n\nNick boards the plane for New York but is able to sneak off to pursue Sato on his own. He finds that Matsumoto has been suspended and demoted by his police force, a deep humiliation. Joyce helps him meet Sugai, who explains that making counterfeit U.S. currency is his revenge for the pollution, the \"black rain\", that he witnessed after the bombing of Hiroshima and the loss of dignity he and his family faced in the aftermath of World War II. Nick suggests a deal where Sugai can use Nick as an insignificant American to retrieve the stolen plate from Sato, leaving Sugai's reputation and hands clean.\n\nSugai drops Nick at the outskirts of a remote farm where a meeting of the oyabun, the other crime bosses of the region, is to take place. Nick is supplied with a shotgun and a handful of shells. Sato arrives a short time later, as does Matsumoto, who subdues one of Sato's men staking out the meeting and who was going to attack Nick. Matsumoto and Nick discover that Sato's men are planning a massacre. At the meeting table, Sato surrenders his single plate and requests recognition and his own territory. However, Sugai demands that Sato first atone for his offenses against the Yakuza code in the traditional way: he is ordered to cut off one of his fingers (yubitsume), which he duly does. As he takes his position next to Sugai, he stabs the elder gangster in the hand and escapes with both the plates, prompting a gunfight between Sugai's and Sato's men. Sato escapes the fight on a dirt bike with Nick close behind. Nick is able to spill Sato off his bike and the two fight briefly, until Nick gains the advantage. The scene ends with Nick having to decide whether or not to kill Sato for Charlie and for all the humiliation he has suffered.\n\nThe film ends with Matsumoto and Nick walking a handcuffed Sato into police HQ to the amazement of everyone and later receiving commendations, which Nick graciously accepts. At the airport, Nick thanks Matsumoto for his assistance and his friendship. Matsumoto tells Nick that the plates were not found at the scene of the gunfight. Nick tells him that whomever finds them will be set for life -- if they know the right people. As they say their farewells, Nick gives him a gift box containing a dress shirt. Underneath the shirt, Matsumoto finds the two counterfeit printing plates."

    "Black Sunday": "On November 12, 1975, Dahlia Iyad (Marthe Keller) arrives at the airport in Beirut, Lebanon. Taking a taxi into town, she walks through narrow alleys and bazaars, then slips into the back seat of a waiting car. The vehicle takes her to a gated compound, where she meets Nageeb (Victor Campos), a Palestinian co-conspirator. He shows her a secret film of an American prisoner of war named Mike Lander (Bruce Dern) confessing his war crimes to his North Vietnamese captors. Nageeb admonishes Dahlia that she's built an upcoming mission around Lander who is obviously unstable, but Dahlia insists she can control him. Dahlia tells Nageeb to destroy the film because it could compromise her mission. Confident that her plan will succeed, Dahlia records an audio statement on behalf of her guerrilla group, Black September, telling the American people that it's time for them to pay for aiding Israel's repression of the Palestinians.\n\nThat night, Israeli commando Major David Kabakov (Robert Shaw) leads a strike team against the compound. When Kalakov enters Nageeb's room and kills him, he finds Dahlia taking a shower in the adjoining bathroom; however, he assumes she's Nageeb's mistress or a local prostitute and doesn't shoot her. Kabakov's men gather evidence, including Dahlia's tape recorder, and escape the compound before blowing it up.\n\nOn November 14, Mike Lander is piloting a Goodyear blimp above a football game at the Coliseum in Los Angeles, California. The head of the television crew is angry because Lander can't get the blimp and its overhead camera in the right spot. But Lander brushes him off, knowing that no other pilot would even try to fly a dirigible in the high winds that day.\n\nOn November 17, in Washington, D.C., F.B.I. agent Sam Corley (Fritz Weaver) is called to the Israeli embassy to hear Dahlia's tape. Kabakov tells Corley that Dahlia's wording indicates that Dahlia's message was not a warning but rather a justification to be heard after a planned terrorist attack. He suspects the attack is planned for January. Kabakov recognizes Dahlia as the woman he saw in the shower, but he has no idea who she is.\n\nMeanwhile, Dahlia goes to Lander's apartment in Los Angeles. Lander is an emotional wreck because Dahlia hasn't contacted him in three days and he thinks she's betrayed him. Dahlia calms him with a gift-a statuette of the Madonna made of an explosive compound that he needs for his project. Dahlia encourages Lander to pull himself together and go to his Veteran's Administration rehabilitation meeting, so that he won't lose his piloting job with Goodyear. Later that day, at the V.A., Lander reveals his bitterness. Despite his heroism and years as a P.O.W. in Vietnam, the Navy turned his wife against him and took away his commission.\n\nOn the night of November 23, Lander and Dahlia unload wooden crates from a freighter in the Long Beach harbor when a Coast Guard cutter approaches. Since Lander's speedboat is faster and smaller, he's able to evade them by running under a low bridge, but the Coast Guard reports the clandestine activity to the F.B.I. The freighter captain tells Corley that he knows nothing about the incident, but when Kabakov and fellow Israeli agent Robert Moshevsky (Steven Keats) sneak aboard the ship that night and threaten to slit the captain's throat, he confesses that his crew delivered 12 crates to a man and a woman in masks. Just then, the phone rings, and when the captain answers it, the receiver explodes, killing the captain and injuring Kabakov.\n\nWhen Dahlia sees Kabakov on television being carried into the emergency room of a local hospital, she disguises herself as a Catholic nurse, breaks into the hospital drug room and fills a syringe with potassium chloride. However, Moshevsky spots her before she can get into Kabakov's room and demands that she accompany him downstairs to the nurses' station for identification. On the elevator Dahlia jabs the needle into his neck and kills him.\n\nAs soon as Kabakov gets out of the hospital, he goes to the office of Muzi (Michael V. Gazzo), the local importer in charge of Lander and Dahlia's shipment. Holding Muzi at gunpoint, Kabakov learns that the shipment was plastic explosives, the woman called herself \"Kaza\" and the man who paid him was an Egyptian in Tripoli named Mamud al Bernardi.\n\nOn December 3 , Lander and Dahlia land a small plane at a desolate Mojave Desert airstrip to test an explosive device he's designed for the mission. Lander gains the confidence of the airstrip's sole caretaker and kills him by firing off hundreds of \"steel rifle darts\"-pieces of shrapnel-in one symmetrical blast. Ecstatic with his success, Lander tells Dahlia that 200,000 darts could cause significant damage if they were detonated 100 feet above the fifty-yard line of a football game from the Goodyear blimp.\n\nBack in Washington, D.C., Kabakov has a secret rendezvous near the Lincoln Memorial with an old intelligence rival, Egyptian Colonel Riaf (Walter Gotel), and convinces him that it's in both of their interests that he find out who Kaza is. When the men meet again days later, Riaf has a photograph of Kaza and reveals that her real name is Dahlia Iyad. Riaf explains that Dahlia was born in Haifa (then Palestine) to an Arab father and German mother, and Israeli commandos killed the men of her family and forced her mother, sister and Dahlia into refugee camps, where only Dahlia survived.\n\nA few days later, Dahlia hauls a speedboat-shaped trailer into Miami, Florida, and parks it in a locked storage area. When she checks into the downtown Hotel Edward, Palestinian agent Mohammed Fasil (Bekim Fehmiu) greets her with news that the Israelis have found out who she is. Although Fasil wants her to abort the mission and go into hiding, she refuses, insisting it's already too far along.\n\nOn January 1, 1976, Corley and Kabakov are alerted that Dahlia has been spotted in Miami, but by the time they arrive, she has already driven back to Los Angeles and only Fasil is at the hotel. Before F.B.I. agents can apprehend Fasil, he shoots his way out and wages a running gun battle through the city until Kabakov kills him on the beach. When Kabakov and Corley search Fasil's hotel room, the commando holds up a magazine with the Miami Orange Bowl on the cover. The two hurry to the Orange Bowl and try to convince stadium authorities that they need to cancel the upcoming Super Bowl X football game to be held on January 18, but the authorities refuse and claim that the President has arranged to be at the event. Although security is enhanced and all flights over Miami during the Super Bowl are canceled, police helicopters and the Goodyear blimp are allowed to fly overhead.\n\nOn January 17, the day before the game, Lander's mission is stymied when Goodyear replaces him with another pilot named Farley (Tom McFadden). Assuring Lander that he needn't worry, Dahlia goes to Farley's hotel room, kills him and puts a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on his door.\n\nThe next morning on January 18, Lander joins his crew and tells them that Farley is sick. At the airfield, the men prepare the blimp, lift off and head for the stadium. During the game, Lander starts a fire in one of the engines, which provides him with an excuse to hurry the blimp back to the field and fix it. Dahlia is waiting there with the trailer and helps to hook up Lander's contraption to the underbelly of the blimp's gondola, claiming it's a last-minute request from CBS-TV. However, one of the television crewmen becomes suspicious and runs back to the CBS remote trailer. Lander follows the man and shoots him.\n\nMeanwhile, the police find Farley's body at the hotel and alert the authorities that the blimp is the terrorists' weapon. Lander and Dahlia use automatic weapons to kill the men on the blimp airfield, including several policemen and an F.B.I. man, then head back toward the stadium, dumping the gondola's equipment to offset the added weight of the shrapnel.\n\nKabakov and Corley commandeer a police helicopter and follow them, using the gondola's limited visibility beneath the blimp to avoid detection. Lander pilots the blimp with the bomb towards the Orange Bowl stadium while Dahlia provides covering fire as she opens fire and shoots down a police helicopter, and forces unarmed civilian media helicopters to back away. Dahlia opens fire on the helicopter containing Kabakov and Corley when it comes into view, slightly wounding Corley when he tries shooting at the blimp with a rifle.\n\nAs Kabakov and Corley swoop down next to the gondola for another pass, Kabakov opens fire with his sub-machine gun, killing Dahlia and wounding Lander, but it's too late to stop the blimp. Using the helicopter's cargo hook line, Kabakov slides down onto one of the blimp's rear tails and connects it to the helicopter in time to pull the dirigible away from inside the stadium and toward the nearby ocean. In his final moments, Lander lights a backup fuse to detonate the bomb. Moments after the helicopter lifts Kabakov free from the blimp, Lander's invention explodes in a ball of fire, spraying the ocean surface with shrapnel. With 80,000 lives saved, the helicopter flies back toward Miami."

    "Black Widow": "In 1995, super soldier Alexei Shostakov (David Harbour) (The Russian super-soldier counterpart to Captain America and a father-figure to Romanoff and Belova) and Black Widow Melina Vostokoff (Rachel Weisz) (A seasoned spy trained in the Red Room as a Black Widow and a mother-figure to Romanoff and Belova who is now one of the Red Room's lead scientists) work as Russian undercover agents, posing as a family in Ohio with Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) as their daughters.\n\nThey steal S.H.I.E.L.D. intel and escape to Cuba where their boss, General Dreykov (Ray Winstone) (Russian General and head of the Red Room Program), has Romanoff and Belova taken to the Red Room for training. Yelena is happy to be back, but Natasha is distraught at leaving Ohio and doesn't want to go back into the Red Room program. Years pass, during which Shostakov is imprisoned in Russia while Romanoff defects to S.H.I.E.L.D. after bombing Dreykov's Budapest office and apparently killing him and his young daughter Antonia (Olga Kurylenko).\n\nIn 2016, Romanoff is a fugitive for violating the Sokovia Accords (The Sokovia Accords are a set of legal documents designed to regulate the activities of enhanced individuals, specifically for those who work for either government agencies such as S.H.I.E.L.D. or for private organizations such as the Avengers. Established by the United Nations and ratified by 117 nations, the accords serve as a \"middle point\" between the Avengers' desire to secure world peace and the international community's concern over the repercussions of the Avengers' actions).\n\nThe Sokovia Accords caused a schism in the Avengers. While Tony Stark supported the Accords due to his role in the Ultron Offensive, Steve Rogers recognized that the government having power over potential missions may be a terrible idea in an emergency and disliked the authoritarian nature of its stipulations, noting that signing the Accords would be \"surrendering the right to choose\". The schism came to a head when Helmut Zemo framed Bucky Barnes for a terrorist attack that occurred during the signing of the Accords.\n\nCombined with Zemo's exploitation of the schism, the Accords tore the Avengers apart, causing Stark's pro-Accords faction and Rogers' anti-Accords faction to destroy an airport as the former attempted to arrest the latter. The Accords caused the anti-Accords faction and Natasha Romanoff, who had been pro-Accords but betrayed Stark's faction knowing that Rogers would never stand down, to either become fugitives or be placed under house arrest, ruining any chance of coordinated defense.\n\nShe escapes from U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) and flees to a safe-house in Norway supplied by Rick Mason (O-T Fagbenle) (An ally from Romanoff's S.H.I.E.L.D. past who is romantically interested in her). Meanwhile, Belova kills a rogue former Black Widow but comes in contact with a synthetic gas that neutralizes the Red Room's chemical mind-control agent. Belova removes her own tracker, sends antidote vials to Romanoff, hoping she and the Avengers can free the other Widows, and goes into hiding.\n\nWhen Romanoff is unknowingly driving with the vials in her car, Red Room agent Taskmaster attacks her. Romanoff realizes that the Taskmaster is interested in a case, and escapes from Taskmaster and finds that the vials came from Belova (it was collected by Mason from Natasha's hideout in Budapest). There she finds Belova who reveals that Dreykov is alive, and the Red Room is still active. Black Widows and Taskmaster attack them, but Romanoff and Belova evade them and meet with Mason, who supplies them with a helicopter. Belova says that the antidote was created by a Black Widow from Melina's generation. Belova says Dreykov has killed many little girls (only 1 in 20 survives the training, the rest he kills), and the black widow program needs to stop.\n\nRomanoff and Belova break Shostakov out of prison (he was imprisoned by Dreykov, but he doesn't know why) to learn Dreykov's location, and he directs them to Vostokoff who lives on a farm outside Saint Petersburg. There she is refining the chemical mind control process used on the Widows (This is what Shostakov and Melina has stolen from SHEILD in the first place, all those yrs ago). Belova tells Melina that her mind control chemicals were used on her, and she only managed to get out because of the antidote, while Natasha abandoned her. Melina also tells Natasha that she was not abandoned by her parents, she was selected by a program that assessed genetic potential in infants, and her parents were paid off. But her mom kept looking for her, threatening the exposure of the Red room, so Dreykov had her killed\n\nVostokoff alerts Dreykov and his agents arrive to take them, but Romanoff convinces Vostokoff to help them (by informing her how her mind control research has been used to kill and maim Soviet girls all over the world) and the pair use face mask technology to switch places. The Taskmaster arrives, everyone is sedated and taken to the Red room, which is a floating city in the sky.\n\nAt the Red Room, Vostokoff frees Shostakov and Belova from their restraints. Dreykov sees through Romanoff's disguise and reveals that Taskmaster is Antonia, who suffered damage severe enough that Dreykov had to put technology in her head to save her, in turn creating the perfect soldier, capable of mimicking the actions & fighting styles of anyone she sees. Romanoff is unable to attack Dreykov due to a pheromone lock installed in every Widow but negates that by breaking her own nose and severing a nerve in her nasal passage. Shostakov battles Taskmaster while Vostokoff takes out one of the facility's engines. They then lock Taskmaster in a cell.\n\nDreykov escapes as other Black Widows attack Romanoff, but Belova exposes them to the antidote. Romanoff copies the locations of other Widows worldwide from Dreykov's computer as the facility begins to explode and fall. She retrieves two surviving antidote vials and frees Taskmaster from the locked cell.\n\nVostokoff and Shostakov escape via a plane (which loses control after they lose their vertical stabilizer and hence, they can't get back to the red room to rescue the girls) while Belova takes out Dreykov's aircraft (by destroying its engine with a pole, by the explosion throws her off the exploding deck of the Red room), killing him. Romanoff, who was watching this, jumps after her. In free-fall, Romanoff gives Belova a parachute before battling Taskmaster. After landing, Romanoff uses one antidote vial on Taskmaster and gives the other to Belova along with the locations of the other mind-controlled Widows so she can find and free them. Belova, Vostokoff, and Shostakov say goodbye to Romanoff and leave with Antonia and the freed Widows. Two weeks later, Mason supplies Romanoff with a Quinjet to use in freeing the imprisoned Avengers.\n\nIn a post-credits scene set after Romanoff's death, Valentina Allegra De Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) blames her death on Clint Barton and assigns him as Belova's next target."

    "Black and Blue": "In New Orleans, Alicia West (Naomie Harris) is out for a jog when she is stopped by two cops. They harass her and think she is a suspect they have been looking for until they see she is also an officer. One of the cops apologizes, but Alicia (a black woman) is used to this type of treatment by racist white cops. She continues her run and stops to visit her mother's tomb.\n\nAlicia begins her day at work with her partner, Kevin Jennings (Reid Scott). They drive around Kingston, which was Alicia's old neighborhood before she left to join the army. They pull over into a convenience store that had been robbed the day before (the police just \"didn't\" get the call), and Alicia talks to a young boy, Jamal. His mother, Missy (Nafessa Williams), sends him away, as she used to be friends with Alicia but hasn't taken kindly to her having joined the police force. She is antagonized by a gang member until he sees Kevin and walks away. The officers then go into the shop, owned by Missy's brother Mouse (Tyrese Gibson), who is also rather cold toward Alicia because of her new life. Regardless, he lets the officers take what they want for free.\n\nAlicia is assigned to ride with veteran officer Deacon Brown (James Moses Black). They ride to an altercation at a nightclub. As Alicia attempts to detain one subject, Brown catches another one attempting to murder Alicia. He grabs and pins him to the car before pulling his own gun on him. Alicia tries to diffuse the situation until Brown shows her the suspect's gun. After taking him into custody, Alicia and Brown sit for coffee, and he tells her that the people in that neighborhood won't have her back just because she's black, and view her as more of an enemy because she's a cop.\n\nThe next day, Brown takes Alicia outside a warehouse but orders her to stay in the car. She gets out when she spots what appears to be a drug deal, but the buyer runs away. Alicia then hears a gunshot from inside the warehouse. She goes in to find Brown with narcotics detectives Terry Malone (Frank Grillo) and Smitty (Beau Knapp). They are interrogating a young man named Zero (John Charles II) and two other dealers. He pleads with Malone and says that they will silence any word of their corruption, but Malone executes all three men. Alicia witnesses the act, and it is caught on her body cam. The men spot her, and Brown tries to keep things together before Smitty shoots at Alicia and sends her crashing through the floor. Realizing her body cam will incriminate them, the men rush to find her, but Alicia has already run, injured from a gunshot. The men see that she dropped her gun and is running around unarmed. They proceed to chase her through the streets. When she attempts to contact dispatch, Malone tells the operator that Alicia is just a rookie who got spooked during a drug bust.\n\nAlicia comes across Officer Doyle (Nelson Bonilla), who appears to try and help her, but she overhears on her radio from Doyle's partner that they are working with Malone. Alicia runs away again and goes around the neighborhood trying to get help, but true to Brown's words, not a single person dares to help her. Alicia continues to run until she makes it into Mouse's shop. He finds her and attempts to get her out by calling the cops. Alicia hides as Doyle and his partner get there. Doyle harasses Mouse and intimidates him with his gun. Doyle's partner runs his license and sees Mouse's priors, but he doesn't report it to Doyle and they let him go. Mouse is visibly shaken up from the encounter. He agrees to help Alicia.\n\nAlicia contacts Kevin to help get her out of there. He picks her up and drives away with her. After she explains her situation, Alicia suggests bringing Internal Affairs in on the case. Kevin lets it slip that he knew Malone was the culprit, which alerts Alicia to Kevin's complicity in the other officers' crimes. She fights him and gets out, forcing her to keep running. Mouse takes her to his apartment to shelter her.\n\nIt becomes known that Zero was the nephew of Kingston Crew's boss Darius Tyrell (Mike Colter). He talks to Malone, who is in league with him, and the dirty cop tells Darius that Alicia went crazy and shot Zero and his friends before running away. Darius spreads word that Alicia killed Zero, which even Jamal sees. He goes into Alicia's room with a gun, but she draws hers on him. Mouse comes in to stop Jamal and sees what Darius sent him. Meanwhile, Brown and Malone try to cover their tracks with Captain Hackett (Deneen Tyler), insisting they go after Alicia. Malone goes with Smitty to the convenience store to find security footage of Mouse helping Alicia.\n\nMouse tries to help Alicia get out, but they are found by Darius's goons. They kill two of them, but knowing that more are coming, Mouse gives Alicia a chance to get away while he gets captured by the thugs. Alicia records a testimony on her body cam and leaves it somewhere safe before entering the complex where Darius lives. She is greeted with jeering and bottles being thrown. After entering the building, she is attacked by Darius, but Alicia quickly tells him about the body cam. After they find it, Darius's other nephew uploads the footage to the computer, thereby giving everyone concrete proof that Malone killed Zero. Darius lets Alicia and Mouse go, as he is preparing to bring hell to Malone. Missy, who is Darius's girlfriend, has a brief talk with Alicia regarding Missy's resentment and how they are not that different just because of the paths they took.\n\nA team of officers is alerted to the Kingston area to recover Alicia, which also lets Malone, Brown, and Smitty know where to find her. Once they get there, Malone kills Brown while Smitty encounters Alicia and gets a bullet in his head. Darius finds Malone and confronts him for his treachery. The two fight, but Malone shoots Darius dead. Mouse manages to sneak past officers with a cop's jacket and makes his way to the station to upload the body cam footage to the police's network. He is found by Doyle and is held at gunpoint, but the footage uploads in time, and Mouse disarms Doyle and pistol-whips him. Meanwhile, Alicia catches Malone and tackles him off a balcony onto a car, but a whole SWAT team has their guns drawn on Alicia when she holds hers on Malone. She is ordered to stand down, just as Hackett sees the murder video at the station. She orders her men to stand down and declares that Alicia is innocent. Malone then tries to kill Alicia, but he is shot by Kevin. Malone and Kevin are taken into custody and Alicia and Missy reconcile with a hug.\n\nSometime later, Malone is charged with the murders. Alicia jogs again towards the cemetery where she is met by Mouse. She thanks him for saving her life, but he says she saved him."

    "Blackout": "Ethan McCoy (Nick Nolte) of the DEA is carrying out a search inside a burned-down house and is looking for Cain (Josh Duhamel). Unable to find any evidence, he orders his DEA men to track Cain wherever he is. Cain was shown escaping the house a few minutes before it blew up. He was pursued by armed assailants and his car was blown up. Meanwhile, John Cain wakes up in a Mexican hospital without having any idea of who he is or how he got there. A woman by his side, Anna (Abbie Cornish), claims to be his wife. There is also a guy named Eddie (Omar Chaparro) who is supposed to be his friend. Eddie promises to help him bring his memory back. He then makes his way to the doctor, under whose care Cain is, and threatens to kill his family unless he brings back Cain's memory by any means necessary.\n\nAnna says that Cain was born on Dec 2nd, 1972, in Boulder Colorado. With time, as Cain's memory comes back to him in bits and pieces, he finds that those around him aren't what they seem. Cain knows that Anna is not his wife. Cain realizes that every time he remembers something, the Doctor gives him a sedative. Cain attacks the doctor and tries to escape the hospital with Anna. Eddie and his men attack Cain and force him to hide inside the hospital. Anna tells Cain that he is very close to Eddie and Eddie is a drug dealer. Eddie and Cain did all kinds of deals together. Cain believes that he is a drug dealer. Cain doesn't believe Anna and ties her to a chair in the utilities area. Cain starts attacking Cain's men inside the hospital.\n\nThe doctor finds Cain and takes him to a cabin. Cain finds out that they are looking for a case he had in his possession before he landed in the hospital. He stole it from General Mondejo, head of the army, someone to whom all the cartels report, and then went off-grid. And since he arrived at the hospital, Eddie has been trying to administer memory drugs to bring his memory back so that he can remember the location of the case. The Doctor was giving him B12 to counter the effects of the memory drugs. The doctor is helping Cain, as he has been terrorized by Eddie for many years. Cain calls a number that he found inside his wallet. He is connected to McCoy. McCoy tells him that he is DEA and has been undercover in Eddie's organization for the last 5 years. Cain finds evidence of Eddie's drugs operation inside the hospital. Cain returns to Anna. Anna tells him that he was recruited by the CIA. John Cain knows he is in a \"Blackout.\"\n\nOne of Eddie's men finds Cain. Cain learns that Montejo paid money $20 million for the case, but Cain double crossed him by taking the money and the case. Cain talks to Eddie. Eddie tells Cain that he knew Cain was DEA (McCoy told Cain earlier that he was DEA), and they both decided to \"play\" DEA by stealing the case and bringing it to General Montejo. Cain escapes from Eddie when his men open fire on him and meets Anna again inside the hospital. McCoy calls and says that the cavalry is on the way to rescue Cain. Later on, it is Anna who confirms that John Cain is indeed DEA, but he was recruited by the CIA to recover the case. So, we do not really know what Cain intended to do with the case. Cain is confused about whether he is the good guy or the bad guy.\n\nAnna recovers the case from the doctor's chamber. We also find out that the doctor actually helped Cain by making him forget his memories so that the bad guys (Eddie and the others) couldn't kill him. It is revealed that the case has \"the names and addresses of the Illuminati\" ... \"the puppeteers and the puppets...\" [that run the world]. McCoy turns out to be another bad guy trying to get his hands on the case.\n\n\"It's about order,\" says Anna to Cain, addressing the importance of the case. Keeping in mind how information is power during present times, any one person with all that intel (that can \"destroy the government,\" according to Anna) can certainly become an international threat, compromising relations among nations and causing disorder and chaos. When Cain went off the grid, he compromised the order. Perhaps because he realized how dangerous it could be in the hands of the wrong person. It was Cain's good fortune that his doctor hid it somewhere where no one could find it unless they looked hard. Anna did. Cain remembers that he was in a romantic relationship with Anna.\n\nCain attacks the remainder of Eddie's men and kills them all, just as McCoy arrives with his troops. Cain gets into McCoy's car with Anna. Turns out McCoy is crooked as well and wants his own hands on the case. McCoy believes that Anna was working for him, but Anna ends up attacking all of McCoy's men.\n\nAnna and Cain run away with the case after killing all of McCoy's men. Cain shoots McCoy as well, but it's only a flesh wound. No single organization should have the case in its possession. Such things should be destroyed unless there is a place where they can be locked away until the time comes to bring them out again."

    "Blade": "In 1967, a pregnant woman is rushed into a hospital in labor where a C-section is performed on her to save her baby. She dies, but her child lives. Three decades later, a seductive woman (Traci Lords), leads a young man to a rave club. At first, he has fun, but he notices other people staring at him. He casually bumps into the club owner, later revealed to be Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), a young upstart in the vampire community.\n\nThe music peaks when blood is sprayed out from the sprinklers above, and most of the people reveal themselves as vampires. In the middle of the carnage, the armor-clad vampire-hunter Eric \"Blade\" Brooks (Wesley Snipes) arrives and kills a number of vampires in the club, leaving Frost's right-hand man Quinn (Donal Logue) alive and horribly burned as the police arrive on the scene.\n\nWhile Quinn's body is being examined in the hospital, he awakens and kills the examiner by biting his neck. Blade tracks Quinn down to a hospital, but he is able to bite a resident hematologist, Dr. Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright), before escaping once again after Blade severs his arm. In an act of mercy, Blade brings the injured Karen back to his lair and introduces her to Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), his mentor and weapon-smith. Whistler gives Karen garlic essence to fight the conversion to Vampirism. Karen resolves to study Vampirism and find an antidote before she becomes a vampire herself. In working to find a stable, viable cure, she soon discovers that the anticoagulant EDTA reacts explosively with the vampire infection.\n\nMeanwhile, Frost clashes with his vampire elders of the House of Erebus. He believes that vampires should rise from the shadows and enslave humanity while the elders believe in the subversive rule of (both human and vampire) society through their influence with police, politics, finance and real estate. Moreover, because he was not born a vampire as they were, Frost is shunned for his radical views and reckless activities. Frost studies ancient vampire lore and comes to believe that he can awaken La Magra, the Blood God, to gain absolute power. Together with his minions, Frost kidnaps and mutilates the chief vampire of the region, then kills him by exposing him to the sun. He imprisons the other vampire elders.\n\nBlade combats Frost's various minions in an effort to uncover his ultimate plan. After another encounter with Quinn and Frost's lover Mercury, Whistler explains to a suspicious Karen that Blade's mother, Vanessa, was attacked while pregnant and that Blade is a half-vampire hybrid with all their superhuman strengths but none of their weaknesses except the blood thirst. After witnessing Whistler give Blade a serum to counter the thirst, Karen successfully develops an antidote to cure herself of Vampirism. While Blade is out on an errand, Frost and his crew manage to invade Blade's lair, kidnap Karen and mortally wound Whistler.\n\nBlade gives the infected and horribly beaten Whistler a gun to commit suicide, then arms himself with a number of weapons and a large supply of EDTA. He storms Frost's penthouse, overrunning the bodyguards, and soon discovers Vanessa (Sanaa Lathan)-his own mother, whom he believed long dead-in Frost's bed. She reveals that Frost was the vampire that bit her while she was pregnant with Blade and caused him to become the Daywalker. More guards arrive and attack Blade as Frost intimates a long since sexual relationship with Vanessa and proclaims himself as creator of their \"family\". Thunderstruck, Blade is defeated and taken (with Karen) to the Temple of Eternal Night for Frost's blood ritual sacrifice.\n\nThe temple antechamber drains Blade's blood and filters it through the ancient channels of the temple. Karen escapes the pit where Frost had put her and feeds Blade her blood, thereby restoring his strength. Frost sacrifices the elder vampires in a mystic ritual and painfully gains the power of La Magra. However, the unintended result was not the awakening of the blood God, but the culmination of the dead elders' souls that fought absorption as the energies consume Frost's body. Vanessa attacks Blade forcing him to kill her.\n\nIn the melee, Karen secures a shotgun from a guard, shoots him dead and kills Mercury with concentrated garlic spray. Blade furiously cuts through Quinn and Frost's minions before engaging Frost. Frost's new powers make him immune to Blade's conventional weapons, so Blade injects him multiple times with EDTA, causing Frost to explode. As the pair leave the temple, Karen offers to cure Blade, but he chooses to forgo the cure in order to continue hunting vampires and asks her to develop a better serum. An epilogue finds Blade observing a vampire attacking his date in Russia, indicating that Blade's new campaign has spread into Europe."

    "Blade II": "Over the two years since the death of Deacon Frost, Blade (Wesley Snipes), has been trying to find his mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), who survived his suicide attempt. With the aid of Scud (Norman Reedus), his new weapon designer, Blade tracks Whistler to eastern Europe, where he is in possession of a large vampire gang. Interrogating the last-surviving member, Rush (Santiago Segura), Blade finds Whistler locked in a tank and kept alive to torture. Blade brings Whistler back to the lair and rids him of his Vampirism with a cure developed by Dr. Karen Jenson.\n\nMeanwhile, a crisis has arisen in the vampire community. A mutated strain of Vampirism (dubbed the \"Reaper virus\"), originated from Jared Nomak (Luke Goss), is sweeping through their ranks. The Reapers are stronger and much harder to kill than common vampires, being almost invulnerable to any weapon with the exception of sunlight. They also have a ravenous hunger, requiring more feeding than vampires, and anyone they bite, Human or Vampire, becomes a Reaper.\n\nIn order to combat the mutants, the vampire overlord Eli Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann) sends his minion, Asad (Danny John-Jules), and daughter Nyssa (Leonor Varela) to find and strike a truce with Blade. After ascertaining that the Reapers are a threat to vampires and humans alike, Blade reluctantly allies with the vampires. He teams up with the Bloodpack, an elite group of vampires originally assembled to kill him. The group consists of Asad, Nyssa, Reinhardt (Ron Perlman), Chupa (Matt Schulze), Snowman (Donnie Yen), Verlaine (Marit Velle Kile), her lover Lighthammer (Daz Crawford), and Priest (Tony Curran). Blade plants an explosive on the back of Reinhardt's head to keep him under control.\n\nThe group starts at a vampire nightclub, while Whistler acts as a sniper to guard Scud in the team's transport. The group finds out that the Reapers are immune to silver, physically stronger than normal vampires, and resistant to normally crippling injuries. Priest is bitten, transformed and subsequently mercy-killed; Lighthammer is bitten but conceals the bite. Outside, Whistler disappears, and Scud is attacked by several Reapers, which he drives off with UV lights. Blade fights Nomak, who is immune even to Blade's anti-coagulant spikes. After a stalemated battle, Nomak retreats because of the sunlight. Whistler returns after the battle and reveals his finding of the Reaper Nest down om the sewer. Nyssa dissects a dead Reaper to learn more about them; Scud and Whistler make ultraviolet weapons for the team.\n\nUpon entering the Reaper nest, the group spreads out. Lighthammer transforms into a Reaper and kills Snowman. He then chases down Verlaine who kills both herself and him by exposing them both to sunlight. Chupa and Reinhardt begin provoking and assaulting Whistler, who sprays Chupa with a Reaper pheromone. This attracts a horde which kills Chupa, while Whistler runs off. Asad and Nyssa walk into a nest and Asad is pulled underwater and killed. Blade saves Nyssa and uses a UV-emitting bomb which destroys all of the Reapers with the exception of Nomak. Nyssa and Reinhardt escape the blast.\n\nDamaskinos' forces betray and capture Blade, Whistler, and Scud. It is revealed that the Reapers exist as a result of Damaskinos' efforts to create a stronger breed of vampires. Nomak, the first Reaper, is his own son; and thus is Nyssa's brother. Scud is also revealed to be one of Damaskinos' familiars. However, Blade, having been suspicious of him since the beginning of their involvement with Damaskinos, kills Scud with Reinhardt's bomb after he reclaims it. Believing the Reapers are gone; Damaskinos plans to dissect Blade to learn the secret behind Daywalkers'. He traps Blade and begins draining his blood. Whistler escapes and frees Blade, killing Damaskinos' human lawyer Karel Kounen in the process. Whistler takes Blade to the Blood pool where Damaskinos drinks the blood and Blade restores his strength and fights his way through Damaskinos' henchmen and kills Reinhardt.\n\nMeanwhile, Nomak enters Damaskinos' stronghold seeking revenge on his father. Nyssa, disillusioned with her father, betrays Damaskinos by sealing off their escape route to the heliport. Damaskinos is killed by Nomak after failing to negotiate with him. Nomak then bites Nyssa, infecting her with the Reaper virus. Blade then confronts Nomak and the two engage in a brutal fight. Eventually, Blade fatally stabs Nomak in his only weak spot (which was found by Nyssa during the autopsy of reaper). With his revenge complete, and wanting to end the suffering, Nomak pushes the blade further in; killing himself. Blade carries Nyssa outside; fulfilling her wish to see sunshine with her own eyes. She dies peacefully. With the crisis over, Blade goes to London where he tracks Rush down and kills him."

    "Blade: House of Chthon": "Krista Starr [Jill Wagner] returns home from her stint as a sergeant in the US army only to learn within minutes of walking through the front door that her twin brother Zachary has been shot and killed. The detective on the case, Brian Boone [Bill Mondy], chalks it up to drug and gang activity because of the tattoo on Zack's neck [anyone who has seen the Blade movies will immediately recognize the tattoo as the sign of a vampire's familiar], but Krista maintains that Zack was not in a gang and decides to conduct her own investigation. Krista steals Zack's police file and learns that he and Danny Milano were previously arrested together. She confronts Danny, who provides no information but does drop a vial containing some druglike substance that Krista pockets. She googles glyphs until she finds the one on Zack's neck; the description directs her to Professor Melvin Caylo. Caylo identifies the stuff in the vial as Hominus nocturna (vampire) ash, worth thousands of dollars on the street. Kids use it for the vampire powers it gives them for a few hours. He identifies the glyph as the mark of a familiar belonging to the House of Chthon.\n\nVampires? There are no such things, Krista tells herself. On her way home, her car is rear-ended. When she gets out of her car to check on the other driver, someone steals her car. Then a voice whispers to her from inside a building, saying that he knows who killed her brother. When she follows the voice, she is attacked by two vampires. Fortunately, Blade [Sticky Fingaz] jumps in to ash the vampires after having followed Krista ever since he saw her snooping in Zack's apartment. Krista's disbelief in vampires is now a bit shaken, but she returns to the professor who tells her about Blade, the vampire hunter. Krista decides that she wants to get in touch with Blade, so the professor gives her Blade's only known address. When Krista goes snooping there, Blade confronts her again. He advises her to leave town before the vampires get her, but Krista refuses. She wants to hunt down the killer of her brother, and she won't leave. So Blade takes her in his confidence.\n\nBlade has also been following the doings of Marcus Van Sciver [Neil Jackson], a high-profile developer who has been pumping his energy and money into redevelopment of historic buildings in Detroit. Sciver was pointed out to Blade as a member of the Vampire House of Chthon, and Blade wants to know where Chthon is located and what Sciver is up to. When Blade learns that Sciver will be present at an opening for the Sciver House Art Gallery, he asks Krista to attend the opening and plant a transponder on Sciver.\n\nKrista is dolled up and looking fine (and in voice contact with Blade) when she walks into the reception room at Sciver Gallery. She attempts to plant the transponder on Sciver but he is too protected by his current girlfriend Chase [Jessica Gower] and his bodyguard Fritz. Instead, Krista introduces herself to Sciver as \"Katherine,\" but he recognizes her immediately as Krista Starr, sister of Zachary. Krista escapes to her car and has an earphone delivered to Sciver so as to communicate with him. Sciver admits that he killed her brother; Zack was nosing around too much for a familiar, he says. Krista aims a sniper rifle at his head, but Sciver keeps moving and ducking behind humans. Concerned that Krista has screwed up, Blade hops on his motorcycle and heads over to the gallery. Unfortunately, before Blade can get there or Krista can fire a bullet, Chase sneaks up on Krista and captures her.\n\nSciver takes Krista to the House of Chthon. Without permission from the elders to create a new vampire, he injects his blood into Krista. Now, all she has to do is to die, so he tosses her off a 15-story building. Krista awakens several hours later to find herself in a bodybag in the morgue. She rips it open and runs outside where she is met by Fritz and Sciver, who take her back to the House to sleep it off. The next night, Chase is ordered to take Krista out and show her the ropes. Chase shows Krista how to find the safehouses of Chthon, warns her to stay away from House of Leichen, and takes her to the Chthon abbatoir for her first drink of blood.\n\nMeanwhile, Blade is searching for Krista. He wants to find her before she accomplishes her first kill so that he can inject her with the same serum that helps him deal with his own blood thirst. First stop is to talk with Danny Milano. Just before Blade eliminates him, Danny gives him the name of a cop, Detective Brian Boone, who might know where to find Krista. Blade hides a transponder on Boone's car and follows him to the abbatoir. Turns out that Boone is a familiar who has a deal with the vampires. He picks up prostitutes, robs them, and then gives them to the vampires for food. Unfortunately for Boone, Sciver is displeased with him and gives him to Krista for her first kill.\n\nSo what has Sciver and the House of Chthon been up to? They're researching a vaccine that they hope will render vampires immune to the effects of garlic and silver. So far, it hasn't been successful. All the vampires on whom they have tested it end up ashing when sprayed with garlic. When Blade shows up at the abbatoir, Fritz begs Sciver to inject him with the newest serum so that he can fight Blade. Sciver is reluctant but agrees. This time it works. Blade is surprised when his silver bullets don't stop Fritz. Shen [Nelson Lee], Whistler's replacement, who is waiting outside, helps out by emitting a high frequency hum that hurts everyone's ears. Sciver calls Fritz off, and Chase and Krista attack Blade. Blade stabs Chase with a silver stake, putting her out of action. Shen emits a second round of high frequency whine, allowing Blade to hold Krista down long enough to inject her with his serum.\n\nBlade drives off on his motorcycle with Shen following. Weakened from his fight with Fritz, Blade has a hard time staying on his cycle and eventually falls off. Shen picks him up. Krista goes back to her apartment. She tries jumping from her window to a distant rooftop and finds that she has the power. The serum is making her think more clearly. She goes to the cemetery to visit her brother's grave. Blade meets her there. He explains how the serum works and invites Krista to work with him, just like her brother was doing."

    "Blade: Trinity": "A group of vampires look for the hidden resting place of Drake (Dominic Purcell), also known as Dracula-the genetic \"father\" of their species. They find him in an Iraqi Ziggurat tomb, although not before, in a moment of blood lust, he kills one of them. The vampires capitalize on Blade's (Wesley Snipes) reputation as a serial vampire killer and frame him for the killing of a human (by making him look like a vampire). During the ensuing manhunt, the FBI locate Blade's latest hideout, and, during the siege, Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) dies (he is killed during the raid, when he decides to sacrifice his own life to protect his research and data). With his mentor gone and surrounded by human authorities, Blade allows himself to be captured and arrested.\n\nAfter both medical and interrogative sessions prove futile, the police prepare to hand Blade over to a group of medics, who are, unknown to them, vampires (the vampire team comprises of Danica Talos (the vampire who awoke Drake), Asher, her brother and Jake Grimwood, the vampire strong-arm). He is rescued by Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds) and Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel), Abraham's daughter, both of whom belong to a group of vampire hunters called the Nightstalkers. King and Abigail reveal that the vampire Danica Talos (Parker Posey), who once temporarily turned King into a vampire, has located Drake. Because he is the first of their kind, Drake is invulnerable to sunlight. Talos hopes Drake is powerful enough to kill Blade and make the rest of the vampires into Daywalkers as well.\n\nThe Nightstalkers believe the vampires are too numerous to kill individually (They kill a few hundred each year, but the vampires are multiplying a lot faster than that), so Sommerfield (Natasha Lyonne), their resident chemical specialist, has created an experimental bio-weapon dubbed Daystar, an airborne virus capable of killing every single vampire in the world on a molecular level.\n\nIn their first confrontation, Drake tests Blade by drawing him away from King and Abigail, incapacitating King in the chaos. Although physically superior, Drake shows an affinity with Blade, as they are both unique to their race and \"honorable warriors\" by choice. While Drake converses with Blade, he uses a baby that he has taken hostage as leverage. Drake considers all humans unworthy of his notice and holds his own followers in contempt. Blade and Abigail learn of the vampires' planned \"final solution\": blood farms where brain-dead humans are harvested for their blood. Blade shuts down the victims' life support in an act of euthanasia.\n\nThe two return to find all the Nightstalkers but King and Sommerfield's young daughter, Zoe (Haili Page), dead; Drake uses the two survivors to lure Blade into combat. A posthumous recording by Sommerfield reveals that she has perfected a small quantity of the Daystar virus, but it requires the blood of Drake and may kill Blade. Meanwhile, King is chained and tortured by Jarko Grimwood (Triple H) and Asher Talos (Callum Keith Rennie) for information about Daystar. When this fails, Danica Talos, tortures King by pressuring his covered wound with the tip of the high heel of her shoe. She also threatens to turn King into a vampire again and force him to feed on Zoe.\n\nBlade and Abigail arrive and fight the Talos' underlings and the building security force. After freeing both King and Zoe, Abigail kills Asher, King kills Jarko, and Blade engages Drake in a sword battle. In the end, Blade impales Drake with Abigail's Daystar arrow, which releases the virus into the air, killing all the nearby vampires, including Danica. As Drake dies, he praises Blade for fighting with honor and tells him that through Blade, the vampire race will survive. Dying, he offers Blade a \"parting gift\"; he also warns him that, \"sooner or later, the Thirst always wins\".\n\nFrom here there are multiple endings: Theatrical ending: As Blade fought honorably, Drake gives him a \"parting gift\" by transforming his dying body into a replica of Blade's. The FBI retrieves the body of who they think is Blade, and thus call off their manhunt. Just as they begin the autopsy, Blade's body reverts into that of Drake's. Hannibal's voiceover tells the viewer that Blade is still alive somewhere, finishing the last struggles of the war; having rejected Drake's hopes of prolonging the vampire race, Blade's war will never end. Unrated ending: The body retrieved by the FBI is Blade's, but he's not really dead. Drake's body is nowhere to be seen, hinting at his survival. At the morgue, Blade sits up abruptly, attacks the FBI agents, and appears ready to bite a nurse on the neck. The ending is ambiguous as to whether Blade has retained his humanity or given in to his vampire thirst as Drake predicted. Werewolf ending: The Daystar virus circles the globe and wipes out all vampires. Blade walks off into the sunset, his long battle finally over. The final shot is of the Nightstalkers battling a new enemy: werewolves."

The blind man is a swords man, who fights against people with guns, swords, drives a car, and does it all better than anyone with 20/20 vision. No matter what the challenge, the blind man can take away guns, dodge bullets, and fight with a sword or stick equally well. A sighted person would have great trouble duplicating everything this blind guy does. Yes, he may have been a Shaolin Monk back in Vietnam, or trained with them, but blind is still blind. As the movie progresses the absurdity of the whole thing starts to wear a little thin on the viewer, and there just is no way to suspend belief and tell yourself that this could ever happen in real life. And since the film is an action film and not science fiction, there should be some attachment to reality. This is surely the dumbest movie ever made, bar none, and the only reason to watch it at all is if you are a Brandon Call fan."

    "Blitz": "The movie begins with Detective Sergeant (DS) Tom Brant (Jason Statham), a hot headed police officer from a turbulent South East London police station, beating up three youngsters, who are trying to steal a car, with a hurley.\n\nBrant is approached by PC Elizabeth Falls (Zawe Ashton) asking to help her in passing her Sergeant's exam. Brant advises her to give it some time as she has come out of rehab recently. Falls had previously worked undercover for the drugs squad and became addicted. Brant is also warned by his superior (Nicky Henson) to control his actions. It transpires during a session between Brant and a police psychologist who mentions incidents involving bugging the Superintendent's office, beating a person unconscious in a billiards hall and the earlier assault on the three youths.\n\nBrant goes to the funeral of the Chief Inspector Roberts's (Mark Rylance) wife. The same night PC Sandra Bates (Elly Fairman) is shot dead by an unknown assailant.\n\nSgt Porter Nash (Paddy Considine) is transferred from West London Branch as Acting Inspector, in place of Roberts who is on extended leave. A boy approaches PC Falls in her home and asks for help as he thinks he killed someone during a gang attack. Falls asks Brant for a favour and he gives her the name of Detective Inspector (DI) Craig Stokes (Luke Evans). The Shooter, Barry Weiss (Aidan Gillen), calls reporter Harold Dunlop (David Morrissey) and tells him that he is the killer. He asks Dunlop to pick between seven and eight and when Dunlop picks eight, Weiss tells him that's the number of cops he will kill. Weiss walks down the street and shoots PC Theo Nelson (Joseph Dempsie), who is sitting in his car.\n\nThe South East London station is thrown into chaos due to the shootings. Brant meets with an informant Radnor (Ned Dennehy) who points him in the direction of Weiss, telling him that Weiss had previously boasted about setting a police dog on fire \"for practice\". Brant meets Nash and tells him about his personal problem of recurring blackouts. Nash tells him that Brant might be experiencing burn out based on his personal experience, as well as confiding that he once attacked a paedophile in his house as there was not sufficient evidence to convict him. Brant tells him about the lead and they both decide to visit Weiss. Meanwhile Chief Inspector Roberts rejoins his duty. At Weiss's apartment Brant recognises him as the guy whom he beat in the billiards hall.\n\nWeiss panics after the visit and flees his apartment. Unknown to both parties Radnor is spying on Weiss and, on seeing Weiss leave, Radnor sifts through his rubbish and finds a parking receipt. Weiss follows Roberts to his apartment and after a struggle, he kills him by pulverising his head with a hammer. Realising his trail of forensic evidence he steals a police uniform and Roberts's badge and burns the flat. He then calls Dunlop and tells him about the murder and that he is now calling himself Blitz. Nash informs Brant about the incident.\n\nRadnor goes to the parking garage and finds Weiss's car. He opens it and finds trophies of his kills. He calls Dunlop and asks for \u00a350,000 in exchange for revealing the killer's identity. Falls goes to meet DI Stokes and asks him to bury the name of the boy and in return Stokes asks her out for a drink. Dunlop meets Radnor and they go the parking garage where Radnor shows him the car and the evidence in it. However Weiss sees this and quickly removes the evidence from the car. He follows them to a bar and kills Radnor in the men's toilet before Radnor can reveal his identity to Dunlop.\n\nDunlop tells Brant and Nash about his meeting with Radnor and the location of the parked car. When they arrive, however, the car is empty and the building's CCTV is faulty, giving them no evidence on Weiss. Falls and Stokes meet for a drink, as Weiss watches them from across the street. In the station Brant finds out the connection between the dead police officers and Weiss. Weiss is attacking all the cops who arrested him and Falls is next in line. Stokes drops Falls at her home and says he will call her tomorrow, which Falls interprets as rejection and angrily leaves the car.\n\nWeiss attacks Falls but the boy who Falls was trying to protect interrupts and is killed instead. Brant and Nash visit Weiss's apartment and, on finding it abandoned, decide to release his photo to the media. A taxi driver identifies him and leads the police to his location. He briefly escapes but is pursued by Brant and caught in a train yard near Paddington. Falls, traumatised by the attack, has a relapse and steals drugs from a dealer.\n\nAt the station Brant, Nash and the Chief Inspector discuss that Weiss may walk due to the lack of evidence. Later Brant talks to Nash about the paedophile incident but Nash declines to talk any further. Brant taunts Weiss about his name 'Blitz' and tells him he is nothing, but is unable to provoke him into admitting to the killings. Meanwhile Stokes finds out from his informant that Falls is stealing drugs from dealers and contacts Brant. They reach her house and find her intoxicated, then throw away the drugs and help her regain her senses.\n\nWeiss is released but placed under surveillance. He returns to his flat and changes into the police uniform stolen from Roberts's flat, then dodges the surveillance and drives to Roberts's funeral. There, he finds Brant and at that time Brant receives a text message and leaves. Weiss follows him to the parking garage he had previously left his evidence in.\n\nAfter following him up a flight of stairs, Weiss aims his pistol at Brant and tells him to face him. But when he turns around, it is Nash and Brant attacks Weiss from behind with a crowbar. Nash picks up the pistol Weiss dropped, the same gun used in the previous killings, and hands it to Brant. Weiss quickly realises Brant's intentions and warns him how his death would be treated by the media. Brant informs him that there was no evidence, that Weiss was cleared and is no longer under police investigation, that the real 'Blitz' was partial to people in uniform and shooting them with the same pistol he is holding. Brant then shoots him in the head.\n\nBrant and Nash leave the rooftop with Brant joking that the case might remain unsolved. The film ends with Brant releasing two dogs on Harold Dunlop."

    "Blonde Bait": "Special Agent Kent Foster of the U.S. State Department files a report in Washington D.C. about his detail in London. Kent explains that his British case began the previous year when he received a cable from London about the elusive spy Nick Randall. Kent then learned that Randall's girl friend, American singer Angela Booth, was performing at a West End theater: After an absence of three months, Randall visits Angela in her dressing room. Angela does not know what he does for a living, but he proposes that they meet at midnight on New Year's Eve at The Oxhead Inn, where they will marry. Unknown to Angela, Randall then telephones an unidentified contact to demand a pay raise and confirm he has Angela. When Angela later reveals her plans to Julian Lord, the impresario who discovered her, he refuses to release her and becomes violent. Angela strikes him across the face with a hand mirror in self-defense, but is arrested and sentenced to six months in jail. Her incarceration dashes Kent's hope that she will lead him to Randall. Kent then travels to England to consult with his British counterpart, Scotland Yard Inspector D. N. Hedges. Kent and Hedges suspect that Angela is ignorant of Randall's true identity, and contrive to obtain her cooperation by arranging for her to visit Hedges' office under the guise of international relations. Kent then enters the office and casually discusses Randall's case with Hedges, revealing that Randall collaborated with Nazis during World War II, murdered Kent's colleague and now works as a courier for a spy ring. Although Angela remains silent, her face registers her distress. Back in prison, Angela confides in Granny Rafferty, an elderly inmate who has twice attempted escape. After the governor denies Angela's request for special leave so that she can keep her appointment with Randall, Hedges and Kent arrange with the warden to let Angela escape, so they can follow her. At the inmates' Christmas show, Granny, whom the warden enlisted to engineer the escape, and Bessie, another inmate, distract the guards while Granny short-circuits the electricity. Granny and Angela then sneak out, and are joined by Spanish inmate Marguerite, who fears that the government is going to take her baby away and place it up for adoption. Hedges and Kent worry that London police, who are unaware that the escape is a ruse, will easily capture the women, but the fugitives escape the city with the help of a boatman. After arriving in a small town, Granny secretly checks in with Hedges by telephone, then takes the baby and arranges for the women to meet separately at her friend Grace's flat. Grace, an ex-convict, reluctantly gives them shelter. Angela, meanwhile, visits her ex-convict friend Cleo Thompson, a bigamist who is dating one of the male prison guards. After changing into Cleo's clothing, Angela arrives at Grace's apartment while Granny is out, and beseeches the anxious Grace to help them protect the baby. However, Angela and Granny later flee after seeing Grace talk to a policeman, and they encounter Marguerite, who has located friends who will take her child. Marguerite is captured by police, but Granny and Angela escape with the help of a friendly drunk, who merrily tosses firecrackers from the rear of his car as Granny drives. The inn appears to be deserted when Angela arrives, but Randall is waiting nearby, and she confesses that she has been incarcerated. Randall surmises that her escape was contrived, and at that moment, Kent, who is hiding in shrubbery nearby, calls out to Randall. Randall draws his gun but is killed in the resulting gunfight. When Angela mourns his death, Kent reminds her that Randall was using her, and assures her that she will not have to return to prison. Kent completes his report in Washington D.C., and shows his boss a newspaper featuring a photograph of Angela, who now is a successful torch singer."

Heinrich believes that the Axis powers are murderers and that he had enough of the war. The lieutenant colonel hangs Heinrich and leaves with his platoon. The platoon is led by Dorfler (Florian Schmidtke) & also includes B\u00fcrgermeister Richard (Stephan Grossmann)\n\nHeinrich is rescued by Elsa (Marie Hacke), who brings him to her farm home that she shares with her brother, Paule (Simon Rupp). Elsa is helping Heinrich as she hates the Nazis. Heinrich warms up to Elsa and says that he deserted as he wanted to get back to his daughter, who survived an allied bombing raid that killed his wife. In the nearby village of Sonnenberg, the SS arrive and begin to search a destroyed home previously occupied by Hebrews (Family of Johannes Lowenstein) as they seek a large amount of hidden gold. Robert Schlick (Simson Bubbel) is the mayor of the town. The house is burnt down, and the SS shovel through every brick to find the Gold.\n\nThe mayor also runs an inn but doesn't have any good food to feed the SS platoon. Meanwhile the allies are closing in, and the SS men Led by Dorfler don't see any way how the Lieutenant Colonel can get the Gold to Hitler behind enemy lines. Dorfler doesn't trust Starnfeld's intentions when he finds the Gold.\n\nA squad of SS soldiers led by Dorfler, plunder the village for supplies, coming upon Elsa's farmhouse. As Heinrich hides in the attic, the SS abuse Paule, who has Down syndrome, and attempt to force themselves on Elsa. They are rescued by Heinrich; the squad of SS are killed but Sergeant Dorfler escapes. Heinrich, Elsa, and Paule leave the farmhouse and hide in the forest. However, Paule, unable to part with his dairy cow, returns overnight and is captured by the remaining SS the following morning.\n\nDorfler brings Paule to the local church and abuse him in front of the villagers. He is marched to the top of the church steeple as two SS soldiers prepare to hang him. However, Paule pushes one from the tower and shoots the other. Heinrich and Elsa arrive as Paule is killed by Starnfeld.\n\nA battle ensues and Elsa is captured. Heinrich is pursued by the SS soldiers & Dorfler and Heinrich manages to escape them and kills several Nazis in the process. Heinrich is badly injured after the last fight with Dorfler and only manages to escape when Allied fighters strafe the town and distract the Nazis. Heinrich hides at the priest's house. The SS are unable to find the gold. They know that Lowenstein tried to buy his way out of the concentration camp and said that there were 31 bars of gold hidden in a box under his house.\n\nThe local priest reveals to Heinrich that the Lowensteins had a son Johannes who married into a rich family. But as Germany became more and more fascist, Johannes realized that there was no future for Hebrews in the country. He decides to emigrate to Palestine, but his parents refused as Germany was their home. Johannes had sold the company and converted all wealth to Gold. During the November pogrom, the Lowensteins were captured, and their house burnt down. The mayor and the town residents hid the gold from the Nazis. But the priest reveals that he stole the gold from its hiding place and hid it in the church. The priest has a girlfriend named Irmgard (Petra Zieser), who attends to Heinrich's wounds.\n\nHeinrich plans to use the gold to draw the SS in and to free Elsa. Meanwhile the town mayor wants to reveal the truth about the gold to the Starnfeld, but he is killed by Sonja, who is a resident of the town. The town people believe that the Nazis will be gone soon, the war will be over, and soon they will be rich beyond imagination.\n\nStarnfeld is in love with Elsa and wants to marry her. Elsa plays along for her survival. At night, when they are alone, Elsa kills Starnfeld when she shoves his own cyanide pill from his ring into his mouth and crushes it. Elsa escapes Nazi custody and runs to the priest's house. Not knowing that Elsa was free, Heinrich lures the SS out to exchange the Gold for Elsa. Dorfler realizes that Starnfeld is dead, and he is in charge. He attacks Heinrich. Elsa realizes that Heinrich came for her and goes back to save him. Irmgard tells Elsa about Heinrich and they both arm themselves for the final confrontation. Meanwhile Sonja corners the priest to find out where the gold is hidden. Dorfler gives his own blood to revive Heinrich as he alone knows the location of the Gold.\n\nThe priest leads Sonja & the others to the church and the gold. But the gold is booby trapped with grenades which kills everyone except Sonja and the priest. That's when the SS arrive with Heinrich. Dorfler shoots the priest as he knew that grenades were meant for the Nazis. This is when Elsa & Irmgard attack the church and provides a distraction for Heinrich to regroup himself. Together Elsa and Irmgard shoot down the remaining Nazi soldiers, with Heinrich killing Dorfler by himself. With the SS defeated, Heinrich and Elsa leave the village.\n\nHowever, Nazi sympathizer Sonja (J\u00f6rdis Triebel) betrays Elsa and doesn't provide any help during the shootout. Sonja shoots the last SS soldier standing and escapes with the Gold. Meanwhile as Sonja attempts to flee in a German staff car, an American Sherman tank crew destroys her vehicle. As she lays dying, the soldiers discover the gold, and while at first consider reporting in the discovery, their Sergeant (Roy McCrerey) tells them not to, so the group can split it among themselves instead.\n\nLater Heinrich and Elsa are later seen arriving at the city of Hagen, where Heinrich has an emotional reunion with his daughter."

    "Blood Diamond": "Set during the Sierra Leone Civil War in 1999, the film shows a country torn apart by the struggle between government soldiers and rebel forces. The film portrays many of the atrocities of that war, including the rebels' amputation of people's hands to stop them from voting in upcoming elections.\n\nThe film begins with the capture of Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), a Mende fisherman, by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels when they invade the small Sierra Leonian village of Shenge. Separated from his family, Solomon is enslaved to work in the diamond fields under the command of Captain Poison (David Harewood) while his son Dia is conscripted into the rebel forces, the brainwashing eventually turning him into a hardened killer. The RUF use the diamonds to fund their war effort, often trading them directly for arms. While working in the RUF diamond fields as a forced laborer, Solomon finds a large diamond of rare pink colouring. Moments before government troops launch an attack, Captain Poison sees Solomon hiding the diamond. Captain Poison is injured in the attack before he can get the stone, and both he and Solomon are taken to prison in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone.\n\nDanny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), an Anglo ex-mercenary from Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), trades arms for diamonds with an RUF commander. He is imprisoned after being caught smuggling the diamonds into neighboring Liberia, and the diamonds are confiscated. He had been transporting the diamonds to a South African mercenary named Colonel Coetzee (Arnold Vosloo), who is in turn employed by South African diamond company executive Van De Kaap (Marius Weyers) and his deputy Simmons (Michael Sheen). Coetzee is Archer's former commander in 32 Battalion, the most decorated unit of the South African Border War, made up of Angolan and Rhodesian soldiers and white South African officers. Archer is desperate for a way to repay Colonel Coetzee for the diamonds taken from him when he was arrested and thrown in jail, in the same prison as the fisherman. While in prison, he overhears Captain Poison ranting to Solomon about the discovery of the large diamond and decides to hunt down the stone. He arranges for Solomon's release from prison and offers to help him find his family in exchange for the diamond.\n\nArcher and Solomon find their way to Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), an American journalist, who helps Solomon track down his family. Bowen soon learns that Archer is using Solomon to find his diamond and will eventually steal it for himself, to leave Africa forever. Bowen, a humanitarian, refuses to help Archer unless he can tell her about the diamond market to stop the flow of blood diamonds out of Africa, cutting off funding for Civil War and ending a mass revolution. Archer gives Bowen the information that she wants and gets access to use the press convoy to travel to Kono to find the diamond.\n\nThe convoy is attacked and Archer, Solomon and Bowen escape and find their way to the South African mercenary force under Colonel Coetzee. There they learn of the attack force preparing to retake Sierra Leone -- a reference to the actual 1995 hiring of South African security firm Executive Outcomes by the provisional government of Sierra Leone. The two men leave the camp on foot while Bowen boards a plane carrying foreigners out of the conflict zone. After an arduous overnight trek, the men reach the mining camp in a river valley, still under RUF control, where Solomon discovered and buried the large diamond. Here, Solomon is painfully reunited with his son Dia, who refuses to acknowledge him because he has been brainwashed by the rebels. Solomon is also reunited with Captain Poison, who orders him to find the diamond, but the South African mercenary force, also after the diamond, dispatches the RUF rebels in a massive air strike which kills many of the RUF rebels and some of the miners. Amist the choas, Solomon suffers from temporary insanity and kills Poison with a shovel. Through a deal with Archer, Colonel Coetzee forces Solomon to retrieve the stone. In a desperate battle, Archer kills Coetzee and the other two soldiers with him after realizing that they would have killed both Archer and Solomon upon locating the diamond. At this point Dia holds Archer and Solomon at gunpoint with a pistol, but Solomon manages to convince him to side with them.\n\nAs Archer overturns a body to take equipment he realizes he has been shot, but keeps this to himself. Having arranged in advance for a plane to pick him up, he radios to the pilot, Benjamin Kapanay (Basil Wallace), who demands that Archer dump Solomon and Dia. Slowly and painfully the group makes its way from the valley towards an airstrip atop a nearby ridge. Archer collapses, unable to climb, and Solomon carries him a little ways before Archer has him put him down. He tells Solomon to take Dia home, knowing that he is dying, and gives them the diamond. Archer holds off the soldiers chasing them while Solomon and Dia flee, and then makes a final phone call to Bowen, asking her to help Solomon as a last favor before looking out over the beautiful landscape of Africa once more and dying peacefully.\n\nWith the help of Bowen, Solomon trades the diamond to Simmons for a large sum of money and the reunification of his family, making the exchange as Solomon's wife and children deplane from a Lear Jet at a London airport. Bowen, who secretly photographs the deal, later publishes a magazine piece exposing the trade in \"conflict\" or \"blood\" diamonds. The film ends with Solomon smiling at the photograph Maddy took of Archer earlier, now published in her magazine along with the complete story of their journey, before addressing a conference on blood diamonds in Kimberley, South Africa, describing his experiences. This refers to an actual meeting that took place in Kimberley in 2000 and led to the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, which seeks to certify the origin of diamonds in order to curb the trade in conflict diamonds."

    "Blood Father": "The film opens with cases of bullets being bought at a store by a woman, Lydia (Erin Moriarty). After she buys them, she goes outside and gets into a car with her boyfriend, Jonah (Diego Luna), along with some other men. The men takes the bullets and load their guns as they drive to their location: a rented house. When they get there, the men (except Jonah) head inside. The tenants of the house are paid by Jonah to stash drug money in the walls of the house. Jonah is here because the tenants have apparently stolen said money and he has come to find out where the money is and to kill them. Before Jonah heads inside, he notices that Lydia seems really nervous because of what is about to happen. So, he gives her a line of cocaine to get her mind off of what is going down. He tells her to go watch the backyard where the children are playing.\n\nLydia is covering the backyard and watching the tenants' children, when she hears gunshots. She heads inside and notices a dead man on the ground and a woman tied up. Jonah is threatening the woman and demands to know what they did with the money. Lydia tries to reason with Jonah about sparing the woman's life, but Jonah is dead set on finding out where the money is and killing the woman. After a heated exchange between the two, Lydia accidentally shoots Jonah in the neck, seemingly killing him. She runs out of the house as Jonah's men hear the shot and rush to his aid.\n\nMany miles away is Lydia's father, John (Mel Gibson), is introduced. John is an ex-convict and recent parolee. He's sharing his testimony at an AA meeting with his sponsor, Kirby (William H. Macy). After the meeting, he goes home to his trailer which also doubles as his work (Missing Link Tattoo parlor). Later that day, the phone rings and he picks it up. It is Lydia on the other end. She tells him that she's in trouble. She tells him where she is and he tells her that he will pick her up in Santa Monica.\n\nThat night, he picks her up and drives her back to his place. Since Lydia is coming down from the drugs and persumably alcohol, she passes out on the drive to John's place. When they get to his place, he carries her in and lets her sleep. A few days pass and John notices Lydia having mood swings. Sometimes, she's mellow and, other times, she's wired and talking non-stop. He looks through her purse and finds packets of drugs. He asks her about how long she's been on these drugs and then cleans her purse of all the drugs that he can find.\n\nThat night, some gang members drive up to John's place. When they get out of the car, he asks them what they want and they say they want tattoos. John says that he's closed. He closes the door to his trailer and notices Lydia looking out the window at them. Suddenly, bullets start piercing the windows of the trailer, as John and Lydia duck down to avoid being shot. John starts talking about how this isn't going to look good to his parole officer. A gang member sticks his hand inside a broken window to open it, but John grabs his knife and stabs the man's hand several times. A few seconds later, the leader rams his SUV into John's trailer, flipping it onto its side.\n\nBefore any more damage can occur, Kirby, along with many of the other residents of the trailer park arrive with shotguns in hand. A standoff occurs, but the gang members proceed to leave, once it becomes clear that they are outnumbered. Hearing police sirens in the distance, John, going against Kirby's wishes for them to stay and talk to the police, leaves with Lydia.\n\nThe next day, Lydia tells John the whole story about what happened with Jonah and how she ended up killing him. They stop at a motel, where they are able to rest for a little while. When John goes to sleep for the night, Lydia sneaks out to talk to the motel clerk (Thomas Mann). He tells her that the police are on their way. He's helping them because he likes Lydia.\n\nLydia calls John on the phone and tells him that they need to leave immediately. John grabs their stuff and heads to the front desk. Lydia tells him that the clerk is helping them. The clerk gives them a key to another room where they can hide out. They are able to make it to the room. John and Lydia watch from the window as the cops search through the rooms.\n\nAll of a sudden, a shotgun blast rings loud. John and Lydia watch as a cop gets blasted backwards and tumbles over the rail off the second floor. A tattooed man emerges from the room. John is able to figure out that he's a professional assassin, working for the Mexican drug cartel. John and Lydia are able to make it to a car. John tries to hot-wire it, but this attracts the attention of the assassin. The assassin prepares to shoot at their car, but another cop appears, which the assassin easily kills. John successfully hotwires the car and is able to narrowly avoid the assassin's bullets as they escape the motel parking lot.\n\nJohn and Lydia go to see one of John's old friends, Preacher (Michael Parks). Preacher served with John in the Vietnam War. It is revealed that John took the rap for something that Preacher did and is the reason why John was serving time in prison. At first, Preacher appears to want to help John and Lydia. However, the next morning, Preacher's wife, Cherise (Dale Dickey) awakens John and Lydia with a gun pointed at them and tells them to get up. She walks them out to a shed out back where Preacher works out of. Preacher tells John that he is going to turn them over to the cops to collect the reward, since he has fallen on hard times. Suddenly, John punches Cherise and turns the tables on them. He gets on a motorcycle and takes off with Lydia.\n\nAs they're driving, two assassins appear, trying to kill them on the road. John stops in the middle of the road, pulls out a shotgun and blasts one of the assassins, killing him. The other speeds by. John and Lydia take off after him. John shoots at the assassin, but misses. Trying to avoid being shot, the assassin drives into the opposite lane and collides head-on with a truck, killing him.\n\nJohn and Lydia take refuge at another motel, where Lydia procedes to dye her hair blonde and John shaves off his beard. He tells Lydia that he has to go see someone, but to call him if anything happens.\n\nJohn goes to see his old friend, Arturo (Miguel Sandoval), in prison. Arturo tells him about Jonah. He tells him that Jonah was, himself, stealing the money from the stash houses and framing the tenants.\n\nBack at the motel, Lydia gets a call from Kirby, telling her that she needs to go to a public place. She goes to a movie theater, where she gets a call. She picks up the phone and hears Jonah's voice. He's still alive, despite being shot in the throat. He tells her that he had to have extensive surgery in order to survive. He appears behind her. She makes a dash to the parking lot, where one of Jonah's men knocks her unconscious. They throw her in the backseat and escape.\n\nJohn gets a call. He picks up the phone and Jonah tells him that they have Lydia. Jonah also has Kirby too. Jonah puts Kirby on the phone. A visibly beaten Kirby tells John that he tried, but that he's sorry. One of Jonah's men shoots Kirby multiple times, killing him.\n\nJohn gets very angry and tells them that he killed his best friend. Jonah tells John that he shouldn't have picked a snitch for a sponsor. John tells Jonah that he knows everything about him and that he will tell his uncle (who's in the Mexican drug cartel) everything about how he's been stealing all of the money for himself, unless he sees Lydia. John and Jonah are able to arrange a meet.\n\nJohn goes back to Preacher's, where he grabs some grenades and a landmine and puts it in a bag. Preacher appears with a gun and tells John that he has guts coming back, to which John suddenly shoots Preacher dead.\n\nJohn goes to the meet on his motorcycle. At the location in the desert, John parks his motorcycle in front of Jonah's SUV, blocking it from leaving. John is able to plant the landmine against his motorcycle, that way if the motorcycle is moved, the landmine goes off.\n\nJonah's men strip John of any weapons and put him in the backseat of the SUV with Lydia. As Jonah attempts to drive off, he tells his men to go move to John's bike. Two of his men go to move the bike and, unknowingly, set off the landmine, killing them. John, taking advantage of the distraction, fights with Jonah and another member of his gang in the SUV. Jonah gets out of the SUV, as John bites off part of the gang member's ear. John tries to wrangle the gun out of the gang member's hand, but is able to use it to shoot Jonah in the shoulder, sending him to the ground. John gets the gun and shoots the gang member through the head, killing him. Jonah gets up and shoots at John, but John uses the dead gang member's body as a shield. Jonah runs off into the desert.\n\nJohn rips the tape off of Lydia's hands. He gets out of the SUV, but is suddenly shot in the stomach by the assassin from the motel. John and Lydia duck behind Jonah's SUV. John urges Lydia to go while he provides cover, but she tells him that she's not leaving him. John and Lydia make a run to another car. As they're running, John shoots back at the assassin, hitting him. John pushes Lydia out of the way, as the assassin takes another shot at them. John gets shot again. He falls to the ground.\n\nLydia gets into the car and drives it to John, providing cover from the assassin's bullets. Lydia goes over to John and he cradles her in his arms. He notices, under the car, the assassin approaching them. The assassin tries to sneak up on them, but when he comes to where John and Lydia supposedly are, they're not there. He looks over and sees John alongside the car. John shoots the assassin in the head, killing him, but not before the assassin gets a couple of shots off at John, hitting him a third time.\n\nJohn gets happy that he got the drop on the assassin. John looks down and notices all the blood on him, gets mad and shoots the dead assassin again. John tells Lydia that he loves her, as he dies.\n\nPolice cars arrive and arrest Jonah. He is taken to prison. Some time later, he is approached by Arturo and his prison gang, where he will presumably be killed.\n\nIn the final scene, Lydia is shown at an AA meeting where she shares: \"I've been sober a year, but I miss my Dad so much that sometimes I can't sleep at night, but I tell myself that he's watching over me. Sometimes, there's this shame that almost breaks my back, but I tell myself, when you owe your life to someone, you better live it... So I just say thank you.\"\n\nFade to black."

    "Blood Monkey": "Blood Monkey is a horror / jungle suspense thriller set in modern day Thailand. The film centers around anthropological professor Conrad Hamilton (F. Murray Abraham) attempting to study a new species of primate, possibly the missing link between humanity and the great ape, found in a hidden valley deep within the jungles of Thailand. The movie opens into action with Hamilton's initial research team trying to capture one of these new (and very large) primates, but fails and is apparently wiped out. Hamilton and his assistant Chenne (Prapimporn Karnchanda) survive and scour the camp site looking for clues and remains of their team. Meanwhile, another research team is inbound, this one a motley crew of incredibly naive college anthropology students with no idea of what they're in for. The students Seth, Amy, Greg, Sydney, Josh, and Dani are flown into a remote region of the Thai jungle, and picked up by a guide who drives them deeper into bush. He drops them off in a panic at the edge of trail/road, which leads further still into the foliage, claiming \"bad things\" are in there and won't go any further. He high-tails it back the way he came, leaving the students to march forth into the unknown. They walk until they reach the end of trail and set up camp. As evening sets in, noises from the jungle raise suspicion until a set of glowing green eyes can be seen close by, watching. Just before the unknown creature attacks, Chenne arrives with a flare that scares off the unseen menace. Chenne escorts the students to the relative safety of Professor Hamilton's camp, and the following day they meet the obsessed man and learn of his mission and their purpose...sort of. Hamilton professes of dream findings in a uncharted region of the jungle and their potential for career-launching documentation. He has Chenne confiscate their mobile phones and hands out information bracelets for each member, which contain all of their emergency contact info, and promptly leads the slightly unwilling team to the valley entrance. After a pep talk, Hamilton convinces the students to continue and repel down the cliffside and into the valley. On their first night in the valley, Hamilton passes around a skull and explains that it's creature he's looking for. The students cannot identify the skull since its characteristics are both human and primate in nature, but nearly twice the size of any known human or primate cranium. They are soon interrupted by a bloody survivor from the original research team, who Hamilton and Chenne quickly shelter and care for. The man dies shortly, and Hamilton claims the creatures let him go, as a warning. During the night, Sydney (Laura Aikman), visits the outhouse, only to be dragged away into the jungle. The next morning, Hamilton tells the team he had Chenne escort Sydney back out of the jungle, leaving everyone very suspicious. However, in another part of the jungle, Chenne is dragging Sydney through the brush and eventually leaves her, a bit battered and beaten. Sydney stumbles into an unseen creature and screams as the right half of her face is promptly bitten off. The team continues to follow Hamilton and Chenne, who appear to be tracking something with a GPS reader. Unknown to the students, Hamilton is tracking each of the students by a hidden chipset in each of their bracelets. At the moment, he is tracking Sydney's bracelet. The team eventually demands more information about their expedition, and Hamilton comes clean...mostly. The students remain unaware that they are being tracked, but resolve to steal the AK-47 in Hamilton's possession and leverage control of the situation to themselves. Seth begins leaving a breadcrumb trail through jungle by tying off pieces of cloth to trees. On their third night, while the students are beginning to fashion their plan for the following day, a foul-smelling rain begins pouring down on their tents. Just as they recognize the smell as urine, Josh (Sebastian Armesto) is dragged up into canopy of the trees. Panic sets in as the team scatters and begins following his screams through the brush. As Greg (Matt Reeves) attempts to follow Josh, Chenne accidentally shoots him, but then proceeds to tie him to a tree as bait. Chenne camps out nearby with her rifle while Greg howells in pain. The still unseen primate sneaks up on Chenne and kills her, just before charging the helpless Greg and dismembering him. Hamilton runs across Seth (Matt Ryan) during the chaos and knocks him unconscious after listening to his complaints. Hamilton locates the two remaining students, Dani and Amy, and continues his venture. Believing themselves to be the only survivors, both women have had more than enough, but have little choice other than to follow the professor in hopes of being rescued. The professor successfully tacks Sydney's bracelet and finds it still attached to her amputated arm, which is dangling from a tree. The professor examines the apparent rigging done to the tree and the arm, only to spring a trap which results in several bamboo shoots protruding from his chest from the back. He delivers a final address to Dani's video camera as they watch him die. Just as they turn to run, Seth appears, battered but alive, to their extreme delight. They run back to their campsite, only to find it cleared of their tents and equipment. Completely panicked, they keep running, all the while the creatures seem to be following close by in the brush and in the trees. Dani is soon swept up into the canopy from the back of the threesome, leaving Seth and Amy with her camera. They run further still and reach the mouth of the cave, where they see all of Seth's cloth trail assembled and attached to the opening. They of course, go into the cave, and use the night vision on the camera to move around. At least one of the creatures follows them into the cave, and grabs Seth in the final moments. The videocamera drops to the floor, and sheds light on one of the creatures for the first time in the film, revealing it indeed to be a huge gorilla with a very bloody set of fangs. Amy is clearly the last victim and she screams as the gorilla bears down her to end the the final scene. No happy ending. What happens in Thailand, stays in Thailand."

    "Blood Red Sky": "A German widow, Nadja, and her son Elias prepare to board a plane to New York; Nadja, who appears to suffer from leukemia, is set to visit a doctor who can provide her with the treatment she needs to restore her health. At the airport, Elias befriends a man named Farid, while his mother takes medicine that causes her severe discomfort.\n\nAs the passengers settle down for the evening, a group of men, including the co-pilot Bastian, discreetly murder the three air marshals on the plane and sabotage the black box, preventing the plane from being tracked on radar. Their leader, Berg, then makes an announcement to the passengers that he and his men are now in control of the plane and expect everyone to stay put until a ransom is paid. Elias tries to hide, and Nadja follows him. A sociopathic hijacker named Eightball sees them and shoots Nadja several times. Assuming she's dead, the hijackers begin the second stage of their plan, forcing Farid to record a statement that makes it appear the plane has been seized by terrorists for a suicide attack, knowing it will then be shot down.\n\nAs Nadja slowly regains consciousness, she begins to relive the day her husband, Nikolai, was killed. He had gone to a local farmhouse for help when their car broke down during a family trip but failed to return. When Nadja went looking for him, she was attacked by his murderer, a vampire who managed to bite Nadja before being burned to death by the sunrise. Nadja soon turned into a vampire, and went back to the farmhouse looking for answers. She ran into an elderly vampire who tried to shoot her for killing his son, but she overpowered and beat him to death before escaping with vials of vampire suppressant and burning the farmhouse to the ground.\n\nNadja manages to access the cargo hold, and removes the contacts and dentures that conceal her mutated eyes and fangs before killing and feeding on a dog. A hijacker catches her in the act and she kills him and drinks his blood, which fully transforms her into a vampire. She finds Farid and they manage to regain control of the plane just as the hijackers are about to parachute out. Berg tries to take back control of the cockpit before Nadja surprises and bites him. She then stabs him with a knife before he can fully transform.\n\nThe hijackers, realizing what they're dealing with, task Eightball with killing Nadja. He subdues her with UV light before extracting some of her blood, but just as he is about to stake her, Elias confronts him with Berg's gun and accidentally shoots out a window and depressurizes the plane. The hijackers take back the cockpit and restore the pressure. Eightball flees into the cargo hold and injects himself with Nadja's blood; she tries to set him on fire but fails to fully destroy him. Soon enough, the other hijackers, with the exception of Bastian, are ambushed and killed by a vampiric Eightball, while the rest of the passengers arm themselves. Nadja convinces them that she wants to help, and they manage to lock Eightball in the hold and secure the plane.\n\nBastian informs Nadja that the plane doesn't have enough fuel to reach New York, and that they must land soon or crash. A selfish passenger dying from an injury releases Eightball in the hopes of being bitten; instead, he kills him and proceeds to turn most of the other passengers into vampires. Nadja, knowing that they will escape if the plane lands, decides to sacrifice herself by using the hijackers' explosives to kill them. Elias stops her and goes himself, but only manages to grab the detonator before being surrounded by vampires. Nadja makes Farid promise to look after him before killing and feeding on Bastian. She tries to save her son but is attacked and drained of her blood by Eightball. Just as he goes for Elias, Farid steers the plane into the path of the morning sun, causing Eightball to burn and fall to his death.\n\nElias uses his blood to save Nadja's life, but she rejects him and flees, knowing that her taste for his blood puts him in danger. The plane lands at an RAF base in Scotland, but the authorities ignore Elias and Farid's pleas and board the plane looking for survivors, resulting in a massacre. Elias escapes from an ambulance and runs back to the plane, so he sees his mother get out of the plane and feed on a soldier, but when he calls her she only returns a hunger roar, then heads toward him with the intention of devouring him. Realizing that his mother is gone and all that is left of her is an hungry beast, Elias activates the detonator, killing her and the other vampires. Farid is released from custody and hugs Elias as the camera slowly pulls away."

    "Blood Work": "Terry McCaleb (Clint Eastwood) is summoned to a crime scene, where Detectives Waller (Dylan Walsh) and Arrango (Paul Rodriquez) tell him the victims are numbers 5 and 6. Arrango cracks jokes throughout, and they show Terry a wall, where, written in blood, is \"McCaleb Catch Me\", and a code number. As Terry works his way through the reporters, he spots a figure with blood on his shoes and gives chase. He almost nabs the figure, but has a heart attack. The suspect comes back to check on him, and Terry fires at him, possibly hitting him as the figure flees.\n\n2 years later, Terry is undergoing a check-up following a heart transplant. His doctor, Dr. Fox (Angelica Huston) gives him a clean bill of health. Terry goes to his boat, and meets Graciella Rivers (Wanda De Jesus), who wants to hire him. She tells him that Terry's heart transplant came from her sister and leaves.\n\nThe next day, Terry meets up with Arrango and Waller, and after some creative bribery with donuts, they show Terry a convenience store security tape of the murder. Terry makes some deductions, but the detectives won't give him more details. Terry goes to the convenience store and starts asking questions, then does some research online.\n\nHe goes to the county sheriff's station to see Jaye Winston (Tina Lifford) with whom he worked once. He charms her into seeing the ATM video of a similar robbery, and thinks it's the same guy. He goes to visit a witness from the ATM murder, James Lockridge (Rick Hoffman). James is angry because the ambulance didn't respond to the 911 call quickly enough. Terry then goes to the ATM where the shooting occurred, and a man in sunglasses asks him to move, so he can use the ATM.\n\nTerry has nightmares, and enlists the aid of his boat-neighbor, Jasper \"Buddy\" Noone (Jeff Daniels) to drive him around. Terry argues with Dr. Fox about morality - she's concerned that he'll reject his transplant due to stress, and quits as his doctor. Terry calls Graciella, and she offers to bring Raymond over and cook dinner later. Later, Terry and Jasper go to a metal plant, tracing a Mikhail Bolotov, who Terry thinks may be involved. He questions Bolotov (Igor Jijikine), and Bolotov attacks him. Jasper comes in as Bolotov leaps out a window. Back at the sheriff station, Jaye tells Terry the shooter at the ATM mouthed \"happy valentine's day\" on the videotape.\n\nTerry watches the convenience store tape, trying to decide if that killer is saying the same thing. Graciella brings Raymond (Mason Lucero) over, and she sees the video he was watching. They walk along the shore, and Terry tries to establish a link between Graciella's sister and the ATM victim. Graciella mentions a special earring that her sister wore, and Terry remembers the man he saw at the ATM with the same earring.\n\nThe next day, Jasper and Terry drive out to see the wife of the ATM victim, Mrs. Cordell (Alix Koromzay). He finds out the victim's sunglasses are missing, and remembers the same man from the ATM wearing them. He goes back to see Jaye, and she tells him Bolotov has been found, dead. Terry explains his theory of the ATM man, but Arrango has the missing earring and sunglasses. The coroner finds a .38 bullet in Bolotov's mouth. Everyone remarks on how tired Terry looks.\n\nAs Graciella talks about her sister, a reference to giving blood triggers a memory - there was an \"I gave blood\" sticker in Cordell's truck as well. They go to Dr. Fox and explain their theory. Terry's temperature is elevated, and Dr. Fox complains to Graciella that she is making Terry sick. Graciella is worried about Terry's health, and asks him to stop, but he refuses. Terry realizes that the killer wanted the victim's organs, since their blood type (and Terry's) is rare. Recordings of the convenience store camera and 911 call confirms that the killer called 911 BEFORE he killed Graciella's sister. The ATM victim would have been saved by the ambulance, except for the mistake mentioned by Lockridge.\n\nTerry and Jaye go back to the ATM, and Terry chases a man in sunglasses, but he drives away. They go to visit Lockridge and find his wife, dead. When Terry returns to his boat, Graciella and Raymond are cooking dinner. Raymond finds the code from Terry's first case, and notices there's no \"1\". They spend the night on the boat, and Graciella sleeps with Terry. Terry hears footsteps on the deck, and knocks Waller and Arrango into the water.\n\nWaller and Arrango take Terry to Lockridge, who has been shot, and there's another message for Terry, with the same code, and the words \"McCaleb, happy valentine's day\". He realizes the same killer is back, and the .38 slug found in Bolotov's mouth is one Terry fired at the victim years ago. He thinks the killer was trying to get Terry a new heart, so they could continue the sick chess game.\n\nTerry returns to his boat, and Graciella and Raymond are gone. Terry drops off a check to Jasper, and realizes his last name is Noone (\"no 1\"). He threatens him, and Jasper confesses to be the killer. Jasper tells Terry that he has Graciella and Raymond hidden, and wants Terry to resume his work. Jasper leaves to set up in a new location, and Terry shoots him. He puts a tourniquet on Jasper and has Jasper take him to Graciella and Raymond. They go to a boat that had run aground, where Jasper takes Terry down below, then jumps overboard. Terry rescues Graciella and Raymond, and Jasper fires on them. Terry gets Graciella and Raymond onto his boat and stalks Jasper, holding his heart. Graciella sees Jasper on Terry's boat, and rams it into the wreck. Terry shoots Jasper, and Graciella holds his head under water, finishing the job.\n\nLater, Jaye and Terry wrap things up on the dock, and Terry takes Graciella and Raymond fishing."

    "BloodRayne 2: Deliverance": "In this semi-sequel to 'BloodRayne', with Kagan, Vladimir, Sebastian, and most of Brimstone gone, Rayne (Natassia Malthe) decides to leave Romania and come to New York City, USA to hunt vampires. Over the next 150 years or so, as the railroads and the people moved west, Rayne followed. In the present year of 1881, one of the towns along the way soon to get the railroad is the sleepy little town of Deliverance. Not even investigative reporter Newton Piles (Chris Coppola), dispatched from the Chicago Chronicle to get a story about the \"wild\" West, can come up with anything juicy about Deliverance. Not much ever happens in Deliverance...until now.\n\nVince (Jamie Switch) and Bernadette (Carrie Genzel) have just finished supper when Vince hears noises out in the yard. Thinking that it might be a bear, Vince loads his shotgun and goes looking. When the noises start to sound like something is whooshing around the outside of the house, Bernadette tells her two young sons, William (Cole Heppell) and Jessie (Aidan Williamson), to get into the bed and stay there. Then she goes out looking for Vince. Minutes pass. The boys get scared and climb under the bed just as someone with tall black boots enters the cabin. The stranger sits on one of the chairs and starts talking to the boys. \"Do you miss your mother and father already?\" he asks, then adds, \"Don't worry, you'll join them soon enough.\"\n\nThe next night, Martha (Sarah-Jane Redmond) has just finished her shift as barmaid at the Deliverance salloon. Bartender Bob (Chris Spencer) suggests that she go upstairs and check on her two young daughters, Mary (Taya Calicetto) and Sally (Jodelle Ferland). The girls have just been awakened by a rapping and a face at their bedroom window. When Martha peeks in to see whether or not the girls are asleep, she is suddenly grabbed from behind. Two other guys grab the screaming girls and carry them outside where the man in the tall black boots is waiting. Martha pleads with him not to hurt her daughters. \"I'll do anything,\" she says. \"That's what I'm counting on,\" he replies and begins to walk down the street. Sheriff Cobden (John Novak) orders him to release the children. When he refuses, the Sheriff starts firing, but the bullets go right through the guy. He continues to advance on the Sheriff and sinks his fangs into the Sheriff's neck. He then turns on Mayor Holden (Michael Robinson), who is wise enough not to resist. This is how vampire Billy the Kid (Zack Ward) came to control Deliverance and take up residence in the Mayor's house.\n\n'Billy' is actually a several hundred year-old vampire from Transylvania. His plan is to make Deliverance the hub of his vampire army, using the railroad to attract travelers, turn them into vampires, and then send them out over the country, eventually making America his domain. Kidnapping the children serves two purposes: 1) to coerce their parents into submission, and 2) to keep a choice blood supply at hand. He even has invited Newton Piles to follow him around and, thus, report on \"the greatest story ever told.\"\n\nRayne has come calling on her friends Vince and Bernadette, only to find them lying dead in the yard, with no trace of William and Jessie. She rides into Deliverance proper to see if she can find the children. No sooner does she get there but that she is met by Sheriff Cobden (now a vampire) and his two vampire deputies who warn her not to use her guns in their town and send her over to \"the Pit\" (the Mayor's house) where she can find employment and get prettied up. Rayne heads over to the Pit where she encounters an old adversary, Flintlock Hogan (Mike Dopud), who invites her to join his poker game with his friends Irish Mick (Vincent Gale) and Kentucky (Steffen Mennekes). When Rayne wins the hand, a fight breaks out, and Hogan suggests they take it outside.\n\nOnce outside, they face each other, draw their guns, and shoot. Hogan drops to the ground and begins to disintegrate. \"Bad reaction to some bullets, some holy water, and some garlic,\" Rayne explains to onlookers. When Kentucky and Irish Mick rush her, Rayne shoots them, too, and they also disintegrate. Sheriff Cobden and his two deputies pounce on Rayne, knock her out, and place her in a jail cell to await hanging at midnight.\n\nWhen Rayne regains consciousness, she is approached by Newton Piles who wants to interview her for his paper. Rayne is more interested in finding out about Billy and his plans. Piles doesn't know very much, but the guy in the next cell turns out to be Brimstone. Muller (Brendan Fletcher) has been following Billy ever since Cheyenne, Wyoming and is on to Billy's plan to use the railroad to send out vampires. Unfortunately, midnight comes around too quickly.\n\nThe vampires take out Muller and hang him. Then it's Rayne's turn. She is led to the gallows, the rope is placed around her neck, and the mayor is forced to read the charges and verdict against her. At the very last minute, however, Rayne breaks loose from the straps binding her hands and cuts the hanging rope. Bartender Bob tosses Rayne her swords, and she uses them to slice the Sheriff's throat before he can knock her out again. She then leaps into a nearby river while the bullets keep flying at her.\n\nHaving been hit by several bullets, Rayne is pulled out of the river by Pat Garret (Michael Pare), who watched her kill those three vampires the other night. Garret is also a vampire hunter and, in fact, while Rayne's hanging was going on, he burned down the Deliverance train station to prevent the train from coming through. When Rayne tells him that she's going to need blood to survive and explains that she is a damphir, not a vampire, he willingly slices his arm and allows her to feed on his blood. Once Rayne is healed enough to ride, Garret suggest that they get a few more hands to help them rid the world of filthy vampire scum. The first addition to their hunting team is the Preacher (Michael Eklund), actually a wanted criminal who wanders around bilking money from religious repentants. Rayne then talks the gunman-for-hire known as Slimebag Franson (Michael Teigen) to ride with them.\n\nCome nightfall, the four vampire hunters load up on silver bullets and garlic, pledge their allegiance to Brimstone, and go riding into Deliverance. Between the four of them, and someone with a Gatling gun, they manage to take out their share of vampires, while the townsfolk watch safely from inside the saloon. Rayne hears children crying in one of the buildings and carefully tries to enter the room. As she opens the door, a weight is tripped and nooses around the children's neck begin to tighten. Only by holding the rope that keeps the weight from falling can Rayne keep the children from being hanged. Seated in a chair and watching, vampire Billy laughs as one of the childen falls and is strangled to death by his noose.\n\nIn the saloon, Newton Piles (who has merely been observing up until this point) snaps. He chides the townspeople for sitting by idly while Rayne and her friends risk their lives to save the town's children. Piles' sermon inspires Mayor Holden to pick up his rifle and dare the others to join him, but they still hang back, so Piles and the mayor go outside to face the vampires alone. The mayor is shot immediately, and Piles runs back into the saloon, once again daring the townspeople to take up their arms and fight. Finally, Martha grabs her rifle, goes outside, and shoots one of the vampires.\n\nRayne has managed, in one fell swoop, to drop the weight and slice the ropes from the necks of the surviving children. She and Billy face each other with their swords. Their fight takes them outside, where Slimebag and Preacher have been killed. Rayne manages to slice the tips off Billy's swords, so he pulls out his guns. Before Billy can shoot Rayne, however, Garret grabs the handle of the Gatling gun and empties the bullets into Billy. Rayne finishes him off with a stake through the heart made from a snapped off fork-handle. The children are reunited with their parents.\n\nThe next morning, Rayne prepares to head for Tombstone where Wyatt Earp is having problems battling the Clanton Vampires. Garret offers to join her, but Rayne rides off alone. Garret walks back into Deliverance with the town's new sheriff: Newton Piles.\n\nOriginal Synopsis by bj_kuehl."

    "Bloodshot": "After leading a successful rescue operation of hostages in Mombasa, U.S. Marine Ray Garrison (Vin Diesel) and his wife Gina (Talulah Riley) travel for a holiday at an Italian beach-side town on the Amalfi Coast. They are kidnapped by a group of mercenaries led by Martin Axe (Toby Kebbell), who demands to know how the US military learned about the hostages and their location. When Ray explains that he cannot answer, as he is not privy to this information, Axe executes Gina in front of him. Ray vows revenge, and Axe kills Ray as well.\n\nAn amnesiac Ray awakens in the labs of Rising Spirit Tech (RST), a company in Kuala Lumpur specializing in cybernetic enhancements for disabled US military personnel. CEO and lead scientist Dr. Emil Harting (Guy Pearce) tells Ray he is the first successful human subject of the \"Bloodshot\" program, resurrecting and healing him through the injection of experimental nanite technology now replacing his entire bloodstream. This technology increases his strength and heals his injuries, but the nanites need to be regularly replaced and recharged or he will eventually succumb to damage and die again. When the nanites work at extreme power, they create a red glowing circle of light on Ray's chest.\n\nRay is introduced to Dr. Harting's other patients including former US Navy diver \"KT\" (Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez), with whom he strikes up a friendship, former service member Marcus Tibbs (Alex Hernandez), and ex-Navy SEAL Jimmy Darlton (Sam Heughan), who overtly dislikes Garrison. After experiencing flashbacks of Gina and Axe, he leaves to avenge Gina's death. Using the nanites and RST servers to hack into databases, Ray tracks down Axe to Budapest and kills him along with his bodyguards. Back at RST, Ray is put to sleep as his nanites are rebooted. As he has done many times before, Harting then replaces Ray's memories with a new scenario of how Gina died, this time with Axe's associate Nick Baris (J\u00f3hannes Haukur J\u00f3hannesson) as the culprit. KT objects to Harting repeatedly manipulating Ray's memories so he will go after different targets without question or remorse, but she is ignored and reminded that RST can kill her by deactivating her enhancements.\n\nRay awakens, once again amnesiac, and is reintroduced to RST, then experiences flashbacks of Baris kidnapping and killing him and Gina. Driven by revenge, he tracks Baris to East Sussex and kills him, despite the man pleading that RST is lying. Wilfred Wigans (Lamorne Morris), a programmer forced to work for Baris, activates an EMP bomb that incapacitates Ray and severs his link with RST. Ray awakens in Wigans's office and experiences contradicting memories of who killed Gina. Wigans helps him realize RST has been manipulating him so he would kill the company's enemies and rivals. Ray tracks down Gina, learning she is still alive but that their relationship ended five years ago, and since then, she has started a family in London.\n\nHarting sends KT after Wigans. After asking Wigans for help in freeing herself from RST control and taking down the corporation, she tells Harting she failed to capture the programmer. Meanwhile, Ray is recaptured by Dalton and Tibbs and brought back to the laboratory. KT and Wigans sabotage the reprogramming process and destroy the RST computers. Ray awakens and Dalton and Tibbs try to subdue him. After a lengthy battle, he kills them as the RST building is destroyed. Harting confronts Ray, confident that the Marine will surrender now that his nanites have been exhausted. To his surprise, Ray is willing to die to achieve victory and activates an explosive, destroying them both. Ray later awakes with his full memories, revived by Wigans who has updated his technology so his nanites are self-sufficient. The two men and KT then leave in search of a new life."

    "Bloodsport": "The movie begins with montages of various hopeful competitors training and practicing their fighting techniques. Interspersed with these montages are shots of the arena where the Kumite will be held. The hosts of the Kumite are rehearsing pageantry and preparing the arena for proper use.\n\nFrank Dux (Jean-Claude Van Damme), an army captain at his base, is summoned to a meeting with his colonel before going on furlough. The colonel has found out he plans to travel to Hong Kong while on furlough, and Dux's superiors want to stop him from entering the Kumite, in part because the Kumite is an illegal, underground fight. It is not sanctioned by world martial arts organizations, due to its particularly violent nature. Fatalities, though uncommon and frowned on, are considered part of the risk. Dux stages a daring escape from his base, going AWOL to travel to Hong Kong. The Army dispatches two MPs, Helmer (Norman Burton) and Rawlins (Forest Whitaker) to find Dux and bring him back.\n\nDux first visits the home of his mentor and teacher, Senzo Tanaka (Roy Chiao). He is greeted warmly by Mrs. Tanaka (Lily Leung), who goes to tell her husband that Dux has arrived. Waiting in the living room, Dux becomes lost in thought looking at Tanaka's katana (samurai sword). He begins reminiscing about his long relationship with Tanaka: As a youth, Frank fell in with two unruly boys who made him come with them to try and steal the sword. The boys ran at the sound of people approaching, but Frank started to put the sword back on its stand when he was found by Tanaka and his son, Shingo. Tanaka admonished Dux for stealing, and Dux protested he wasn't going to steal it. Tanaka slices the visor off of Dux's baseball cap and is impressed that Dux doesn't flinch. Meeting with Dux's parents, he convinces them to let him train Frank in martial arts. At first, the young Dux becomes frustrated that he is only learning some of Tanaka's knowledge while Shingo is being trained far more intensively. Shingo is being groomed to represent his family in the kumite as an adult. But tragedy strikes when Shingo dies as a young adult. A heartbroken Tanaka, having already lost his first family in Hiroshima, chooses to stop all training, believing his family is ended. Dux makes an impassioned plea for Tanaka to train him fully, to compete in the Kumite on Shingo's behalf, to honor both Shingo and Tanaka. Montages are shown of this training, becoming more and more intensive, until at the pinnacle, Dux is able to ignore pain and operate while blindfolded as if still fully sighted.\n\nDux goes to see Tanaka, who is now an old man and showing the infirmities of old age. He tells Dux that when he fights, Tanaka's spirit will be there, fighting beside him, and in the Kumite, he will need it.\n\nDux arrives at the hotel where most of the Kumite participants are staying. He meets Ray Jackson (Donald Gibb) playing a karate video game. The two play the game together and start to bond as friends and as fellow Americans. Jackson is a big, brawny, beer-swilling brawler with a scruffy beard. Not knowing anything of Dux, he likes the smaller man and treats him almost like a 'little brother.'\n\nAlso at the same hotel, an American journalist named Janice Kent (Leah Ayres) is questioning two men about the kumite. She knows it is being held in Hong Kong over the next three days and is trying to get a story on it. The two men don't acknowledge even knowing what the kumite is.\n\nHelmer and Rawlins arrive at the Tanaka home to find out if Dux was there and if the Tanakas knew he was going to Hong Kong. Mrs. Tanaka says that Dux came by to pay his respects, but she doesn't know if he was heading to Hong Kong. Rawlins is sure she does know and tries to press her, but Helmer steps in, simply thanking Mrs. Tanaka for speaking to them.\n\nDux and Jackson go to check in at their hotel and are told that a Victor Lin is looking to speak to them. Lin (Ken Siu) comes across Dux and Jackson at that moment and introduces himself, saying he is one of the Kumite agents and he's been assigned to assist them with their stay in Hong Kong. He leads them through the streets of the city to a run-down, seedy part of the city (the long-since demolished Kowloon Walled City or \"no man's land\", as Lin calls it), explaining that the Kumite is being held in Hong Kong at the permission of the \"Triad,\" the Chinese Mafia. At the entrance to a back alley being guarded by several tall, burly, stoic men. Victor speaks to them in Mandarin, and the tallest of the guards, their leader, lets them all through with a condescending air toward the American foreigners. Victor leads them through the alley to the secret arena where the Kumite will be held. The first step is to properly register for the Kumite. Participation is by invitation only. As Jackson and Dux present their invitations, the officials stop and are very dubious of Dux, because his invitation lists him as being part of the Tanaka Clan. Clearly they know of Senzo Tanaka and are unwilling to believe, at face value, that Dux is a student of Tanaka's. They insist he prove this claim with a demonstration of the legendary \"Dim Mak\" pressure point strike. They show him where several bricks are stacked. To properly demonstrate the Dim Mak, Dux must shatter the bottom-most brick without damaging either of the two bricks stacked atop it. As all the other participants in the arena watch, Dux successfully demonstrates the Dim Mak. The officials accept Dux as authentic and complete his registration. The Kumite participants resume training and sparring, except for one-- a large, burly Korean man named Chong Li (Bolo Yeung) who is not impressed, warning Dux, \"Bricks don't hit back.\"\n\nHelmer and Rawlins go to the Hong Kong police department and confer with Inspector Chen (Philip Chan). They give him a photo of Dux, explain that they are trying to stop him from competing in the Kumite, and they ask Chen to contact them if his men learn anything about Dux's whereabouts. Chen is very dismissive but tells the two MP's that he'll see what he can do.\n\nBack at the hotel, Dux and Jackson find Janice Kent trying to get a story on the Kumite from one of the participants, a Mid-Eastern fighter named Hossein (Bernard Mariano). Hossein and his friends are surly and condescending. Hossein is only willing to speak if he can take Janice to bed, a proposition she finds repulsive. Hossein is offended at her defiance and is about to slap her when Dux and Jackson intervene. Jackson is ready to melee, but Dux asks everyone if it's worth getting ejected from the Kumite over a woman. Despite Janice's indignant protests, Dux arranges an alternative contest-- he puts a coin in Hossein's hand and challenges him to close his hand into a fist around the coin before Dux can successfully snatch the coin out of his palm. Hossein is amused and overly cocky at the challenge, but the smirk is wiped off his face when Dux succeeds in grabbing the coin and replacing it with a different coin. Per the terms of the bet, Hossein and his friends have to leave Janice alone.\n\nDux and Janice are talking as they take a walk, and Janice tells Dux about her ambition to get a story on the Kumite, which she describes as 'a cockfight, except with people.' Dux agrees to speak to Janice, and asks her to dinner in return.\n\nThe first day of the Kumite arrives, and the opening pageantry is conducted and the host organization introduces itself, speaking about the traditional background of the contest.\n\nAs the Kumite prepares for the first fight, Victor reminds Dux and Jackson that the contests are full-contact, and there are three ways to win-- knock the opponent out, knock them off the platform, or force the opponent to shout the word \"matte,\" which is a cry of surrender similar to saying 'Uncle.'\n\nThe first-round bouts are conducted, showing several participants standing out as victorious and forces to be reckoned with -- a Polynesian fighter named Parades (Michel Qissi), a Chinese kung-fu fighter named Chuan Ip Mung (Dennis Chu), a big and burly Japanese Sumo fighter named Pumola (David Ho), a Muay Thai kickboxer named Paco (Paulo Tocha), Jackson, and Chong Li, who is the current champion. Chong Li exults in hearing the crowd cheer his name, and enjoys finishing his matches by maiming and crippling his opponents. He is notorious for having killed a participant at the last Kumite. Chong Li easily dispatches his opponent, breaking his own world record for the fastest knockout.\n\nDux's first opponent is none other than Hossein. The Syrian fighter is eager for a little revenge, but Dux not only knocks him out, but proceeds to break Chong Li's new record for fastest knockout -- and Chong Li is noticeably angered.\n\nHelmer and Rawlins are eating lunch when Inspector Chen comes to see them. He's found out the name of the hotel Dux is staying at. Helmer and Rawlins confront Dux in the lounge there as he is talking with Jackson. They pull taser stun-guns and order him to come with them immediately. A football tackle by Jackson takes them down and gives Dux time to run. He leads them on an amusing chase scene, seemingly toying with them before giving them the slip.\n\nDux meets with Janice that evening for dinner. He tells her a little about the Kumite, but insists she cannot truly understand it without seeing it-- and the Kumite doesn't allow just anyone in, even as spectators-- they are especially strict about keeping press out. Janice asks Dux to pull some strings to let her come in and watch. She even sleeps with him as an incentive (and because she likes him). In the morning he kisses her goodbye and tells her that he cannot get her inside. But Janice quickly finds another way of entry, going \"undercover\" posing as a date to a wealthy spectator.\n\nA number of Kumite bouts are shown, and Dux, Chong Li, Chuan Ip Mung, Pumola, and Paco stand out, eliminating various opponents. Chong Li fights Parades, whose longer reach lets him land various combination punches that jar Chong Li. But Chong Li adopts a counter-punching strategy and gets inside, landing brutal attacks that leave Parades completely dazed and stunned. Playing to the crowd, Chong Li executes a brutal stomping kick to his opponent's kneecap, breaking Parades' leg and presumably crippling him.\n\nMore fights are shown, and more fighters are eliminated. Dux defeats Pumola by doing a split to get under Pumola's charge, and punching his groin. The crowd begins to chant Dux's name, which really gets Chong Li angry.\n\nRay Jackson finds himself facing Chong Li. Jackson is remarkably confident and arrogant, and shrugs off warnings of caution from both Dux and Victor. Dux has noticed a weakness in Chong Li's fighting style-- Parades almost turned the tables on him by landing a stiff punch to Chong Li's belly. Dux advises Jackson to focus on punches to the stomach, and warns Jackson to stay away from Chong Li's right leg. Jackson brushes off the warnings and advice, saying he has everything under control.\n\nAs the fight begins, Jackson pounds on Chong Li's head with several hammering blows that drive him to one knee. Jackson then turns away, thinking he has the fight in the bag, and plays to the crowd, trying to get them to chant his name the way they chant Chong Li's name. From ringside, Dux tries to call out to Jackson to focus on finishing Chong Li, who is still on one knee, nursing his bruises and recovering. But by the time Jackson turns back to face Chong Li, the burly Korean fighter has risen back to his feet and is ready to show the whole crowd what happens to people who try to make a mockery of him. Chong Li lands a devastating kick that turns the tide of battle in a heartbeat. Not satisfied with merely defeating Jackson, Chong Li lets his rage bubble to the surface and delivers a frighteningly brutal stomp to the head of his prone opponent, as Victor struggles to hold Dux back from intervening. Jackson is unconscious and bleeding profusely from his mouth as Chong Li pulls off Jackson's biker bandanna and claims it as a trophy, shaking it in front of Dux as a dire warning.\n\nAt the hospital, Jackson is being examined by doctors. Dux speaks to the unconscious Jackson, telling him he's lucky to have such a hard head, which saved him from being permanently maimed. Dux vows to get revenge on Chong Li. Janice is there as well, and she is horrified at the personal vendetta. The two argue passionately outside the hospital. Dux points out Janice's career as a reporter, and she is trying to be the best she can be-- Dux is doing the same; to be the best fighter he can be. Seeing she cannot budge Dux, Janice resignedly shouts that she only hopes Dux doesn't end up in a similar state as Jackson-- or even worse, before storming off. Lin goes up to Dux and admonishes him to forget Janice, as well as Jackson's injury and also about revenge. Dux has the chance to become the first fighter from the Western hemisphere to ever win the Kumite, but he needs to have a clear head.\n\nDesperate to see Dux spared from grievous injury, Janice turns to Inspector Chen. Knowing that the Kumite is illegal under Hong Kong law, Janice hopes to see the police get involved in stopping the competition. Inspector Chen is again dismissive, until Janice gives him Dux's name.\n\nRiding a bus back to his hotel, Dux is haunted by memories of the bout and mistakenly thinks he sees Chong Li's reflection in the bus window, glaring at him.\n\nWalking through the back alley for the final rounds of competition, Dux finds he has to fight his way through a gauntlet of Inspector Chen's police officers. After getting past them, he finds Helmer and Rawlins waiting at the doors to the arena with Chen and Janice. Helmer and Rawlins have their taser stun-guns at the ready. Dux uses a trash can lid to deflect the taser darts and grabs their weapons away. Knowing they cannot take Dux hand to hand, Helmer disgustedly enters the arena with Rawlins and Janice to observe the final bouts, hoping they do not have to scrape Dux up off the floor.\n\nIn the arena, the officials are unaware of what is going on outside-- only that as a result of the melee, Dux is extremely late in showing up. They are just about to disqualify him when Dux enters.\n\nDux's semifinal match is against Paco. As the fight begins, Paco extends his fists, motioning for Dux to touch knuckles with him. Warily, Dux finally does so, and is hit by a cheap shot from Paco. Recovering, Dux wades into battle and knocks Paco out.\n\nChong Li's semi-final opponent is Chuan Ip Mung. Chuan gives Chong Li the stiffest resistance he's encountered in the Kumite, but even he cannot withstand the power of Chong Li's blows. Chong Li has Chuan supine and barely conscious on the ground, and starts to play to the crowd. But then, looking to send a message to Dux, Chong Li grabs Chuan's head and brutally snaps his neck. The crowd falls completely silent as the referee feels for breath and looks at Chong Li in appalled shock. Chuan is dead.\n\nThe officials all stand and turn their backs to Chong Li, facing the wall and bowing their heads in a moment of silence. To Chong Li's disappointment the whole crowd, including Helmer, Rawlins and Janice, follow suit. Chong Li warns Dux that he is next, and Dux just glares back before joining the rest of the crowd in the moment of silence. Disgusted at their abandonment of him as a champion, Chong Li gives them all a final dismissive wave and walks off the platform.\n\nAs Chong Li prepares for the final bout, his trainer (Wilson Lee) carefully and stealthily slips a small chunk of a chalky substance into the waistband of his trunks. (Hinted to be cocaine but not stated definitively)\n\nDux and Chong Li step onto the platform for the final bout to determine the Kumite's champion. Chong Li points to Jackson's bandanna, which he has tied around his calf, saying he plans to break Dux like he did Dux's friend in return for Dux's breaking his record. Dux stares back unafraid.\n\nThe bout begins and Dux quickly seizes initiative. He takes control following the advice he tried to give Jackson, focusing on repeated punches and kicks to Chong Li's stomach and watching for kicks from Chong Li's right leg. He knocks Chong Li down, staggering him. On one knee, using his body to shield the action, Chong Li carefully removes the chalky object from his trunks and crushes it into a powder in his hand. Rising to his feet, he throws a punch that falls well short of his mark but, unseen by everyone else, flings the powder into Dux's eyes. Aside from his vision being completely clouded over, Dux appears to fall into a near stupor. The tables are turned and Chong Li takes the opportunity to enjoy beating Dux from pillar to post.\n\nOn the mat, screaming in frustration, Dux suddenly clears his mind and appears to go into a meditative trance. Flashbacks are shown of his training with Tanaka, including training where he is blindfolded and learns to operate through his other senses as if he were fully sighted. Dux blocks a punch to his head and throws a ground side kick to Chong Li's stomach. Rising to his feet, Dux begins to step carefully around the arena, but always able to fend off Chong Li's attacks and land more blows to his stomach. Chong Li tries to throw Dux off by pushing the referee into him, but Dux, grabbing a handful of the ref's tunic, recognizes the ploy and carefully eases the referee behind him. He takes control of the match, hammering Chong Li's stomach and then going up to the head with leaping, spinning wheel kicks that knock the burly Chong Li completely for a loop, spilling him to the mat.\n\nDux refuses to settle for a mere knockout. He needs to establish absolute dominance-- meaning even Chong Li himself must declare it to the whole crowd. Dux grabs Chong Li's head and gradually twists his neck, shouting, \"Say it!\" He twists Chong Li's neck harder until it is clear that his neck will snap if he doesn't comply. With his very life on the line, Chong Li defeatedly shouts 'matte,' and the crowd goes wild as the referee gestures to signal Dux's victory.\n\nThe closing ceremony shows the officials presenting Dux with a beautifully crafted Japanese katana with words of praise. The whole crowd, including Helmer, Rawlins and Janice, applaud as Dux looks up to the ceiling and says quietly, \"This is for you, Shidoshi.\"\n\nDux and Janice visit Jackson at the hospital. Jackson has regained consciousness and is convalescing. He is notably impressed as Dux's victory-- forcing Chong Li to submit, no less-- but jokingly warns that Dux might have to fight him next time. Dux and Jackson give an emotional handshake, their bond having strengthened to near blood-brothers.\n\nHelmer and Rawlins are waiting at the airport in front of a plane to take Dux back to the United States. They wait, and finally they are convinced that Dux has given them the slip yet again. Suddenly they hear a whistle behind them and turn to see Dux just inside the plane's boarding doorway, telling them to hurry up. The two MP's are grudgingly amused as they board the plane.\n\nJust as Dux is about to re-enter the plane, a cab pulls up and Janice steps out. Looking up at Dux, she gives him the Chinese covered-fist salute. The camera freezes on Dux returning the salute and bowing his head to her. Captions proceed to give Dux's career fight stats in the Kumite over several years, saying he established four records that were still standing at the time of the movie's release, and that he retired undefeated, before establishing his own martial arts school. Fade out as the credits begin to roll."

    "Bloody Mallory": "Mallory is France's answer to Buffy...sort of. Buffy was blonde; Mallory has flaming orange-red streaked hair. Buffy dressed in pastel skirts and flowery halter tops; Mallory wears red and black vinyl with combat boots. Buffy hung around with two other high school students--geek Xander and witch Willow; Mallory hangs with a mute, telepathic juvenile named Talking Tina, a blue-haired drag queen and explosives expert named Vena Cava, and the head of Commando Operations, Inspector Durand. Buffy took directions from her mentor Giles; Mallory consults the Necronomicon. Buffy was single; Mallory killed her husband with an ax on their wedding night when she found out he was a demon about to sacrifice her. What Buffy and Mallory do have in common is that they fight vampires and other evil creatures.\n\nWhile speaking to a crowd in Paris, Pope Hieronymous I has been kidnapped. The Ministry of Secret Services has called Anti-Paranormal Commando Operations leader Mallory [Olivia Bonamy] to find him, much to the dismay of Carmina Belladone, the Vatican's press attache. After watching a videotape of the actual kidnapping, Mallory believes the masked kidnappers to be the living dead, but Belladone thinks they were just terrorists in bulletproof vests. She's not about to buy rubbish about \"living dead\" nor does she like Mallory and her band of superstitious mercenaries.\n\nIt's not going to be an easy mission. On their last assignment fighting ghouls, Vena Cava wound up in a neck splint, and Talking Tina was bitten by baby ghouls and now lies in a coma that the doctors say could be permanent. Worst of all, Inspector Durand was killed. Before embarking on the search for the Pope, Mallory invokes the spirit of her dead husband [Julien Boisselier] who is now a wandering demon in limbo. He is able to identify the kidnappers as evil spirits who have vowed obedience to Abbadon the Dark, the exterminating angel who fell from God's grace during the Original Fall. Rumors are circulating about him in limbo, demon hubby says. They say that he's preparing to free the fallen angels and destroy all of creation.\n\nMallory gets a list of all supernatural events occurring in France over the past five years. Plotting them on a map of France, she notices that they form a pentangle. Using that pentangle, she heads south from Paris in her pink and black hearse to a spot where 5,000 inhabitants disappeared some 15 years ago. Along the way, she is surprised when a bat lands on her windshield and it turns out that Talking Tina has possessed it. Using her negative energy detector, Mallory is led to a gate in the middle of a forest. Passing through the gate, she finds herself in another dimension, so she gets back in her car and drives through the gate. When she comes to a crossroads and has the choice of going to the Crypte des Vampires (Vampire's Crypt) or the Relais des Loups Garou (Werewolf Inn), she heads towards the vampires.\n\nMallory stops at a gas station that sells Fresh A+. Talking Tina detects telepathic waves coming from behind the station. Mallory checks it out and finds several humans being held in cages. After releasing them, she discovers that one of them is Father Carras [Adri\u00e0 Collado], one of the Pope's bodyguards who also disappeared when the Pope was kidnapped. Carras doesn't know where the Pope is, but he decides to teem up with Mallory. Tina takes over the hulking body of the gas station attendant, and they're on their way again.\n\nMeanwhile, Vena Cava [Jeffery Ribier], who was left behind in Paris, has been searching for Mallory with her locator. She found the gate, went through it, and meets up with Mallory just as Mallory, Tina, and Carras are attacked by hordes of cloaked ghouls. Vena jumps on top of a cement post, aims her thick-soled boots, and shoots silver bullets. Well, she thought they were silver bullets. Guess that the salesman lied. In order to get away from the ghouls, the four Commandos jump into a well where they find a secret passage. Labyrinth though it is, they manage to find the Pope [Laurent Spielvogel] when Tina leans on a wall and it breaks through. While the Pope complains, Carras releases him. Mallory notices the lack of guards and becomes concerned that releasing the Pope was a bit too easy.\n\nUnbeknown to the Commandos, they have been being watched by the vampire Lady Valentine [Valentina Varagas] and the succubus Morphine [Sophie Tellier]. Cautiously, the Commandos head back through the labyrinth, looking for the exit. Suddenly, they come upon a green dragonlike monster that chases them until they deadend in a small room and the door closes, shutting out the dragon. When they spread out to look for an exit, a wall of spikes drops down in the center of the room, trapping Vena, the Pope, and Tina on one side and Mallory and Carras on the other. While the Pope continues to kvetch, Vena finds a lever under a floorstone and turns it. The wall begins to move. It's going to crush Mallory and Carras. Vena turns the lever the other way, and the wall stops. Then it begins to move in the opposite direction. If not stopped, it's now going to crush Vena, Tina, and the Pope.\n\nVena grabs her tube of blue lipstick and aims it at one of the other walls. The lipstick explodes, creating a hole. First she pushes the Pope through the hole. Then Vena follows. Unfortunately, the hole isn't big enough for the gas station attendant to fit through, so Tina transfers herself into Vena's body. The gas station attendant is crushed. While Tina looks for another body to possess (she can't get into the Pope for some reason), Mallory and Carras come across some writing carved into the wall. It's in Latin and Carras can read it after making a rubbing. It tells the story of how God locked the fallen angels in an abyss but Abbadon escaped. A prophecy says that he will reincarnate as a human every 100 years \"until he is the one God entrusts with the keys to His Kingdom.\" Mallory and Carras put 2+2 together and realize that Abbadon is none other than the Pope.\n\nSeparated from Vena, Tina, and the Pope, Mallory and Carras search for them. They come upon a young man in chains. Carras wants to release him, but Mallory notices the bite marks on his neck. As they fight over whether or not to destroy the man, Lady Valentine appears. In front of Mallory and Carras, she sinks her fangs into the man's neck and drinks him dry. Mallory recognizes her immediately as the Pope's press attache, Carmina Belladone (\"always sucking up\"). Lady V then turns on Mallory. Mallory puts up a fight, but Lady Valentine is immortal. Not even a pole through her heart can stop her. Lady V captures Mallory and Carras and takes them to her castle in the sky, where Vena is already being held in chains.\n\nThe Pope is there, too. He explains to them that his kidnapping was actually an elaborate ruse to lure Mallory to him. Now that she's out of the way, he plans to destroy the world of sinful humans to make room for the fallen angels who were created by God in His image, perfect and immortal. Wanting her to witness his ascendancy, he has Mallory placed in spiked handcuffs and suspended from the ceiling rather than destroying her. Mallory reminds him that she never works alone, so the Pope/Abbadon calls in Morphine the succubus, who can assume other personas. Morphine metamorphs into Mallory, kills the Minister of Secret Services, and convinces the Army General to send his troops to the Loire valley, leaving Paris unprotected.\n\nMorphine then pays a visit to Tina in her hospital bed. Tina [Thylda Bar\u00e8s] has managed to get back into her own body, so when Morphine shows up, they have a telepathic showdown. Tina wins. Because her body is still weak, Tina takes over the body of a young nurse and returns to help Mallory. In the meantime, Mallory's demon hubby comes to her to enjoy the spectacle but, perhaps out of a sense of guilt or maybe even love for Mallory, he informs her that the mixing of their blood when she killed him has actually imbued her with power. He compels her to use this power to free herself. Mallory focuses, and the handcuffs break away. Mallory kisses demon hubby. The next thing she knows, she is kissing Carras.\n\nTina advises Mallory and Carras about Morphine killing the chief and having the troops sent to the Loire. The three of them hurry back to Paris, where the Pope/Abbadon is invoking the Powers of the Universe and the Forces of the Ether to open the Gates of Hell, where he intends to send all humans (which doesn't sit well with the vampire Valentine). On a makeshift altar in front of him lies Vena, awaiting sacrifice. While ghouls chant \"Abbadon! Abbadon!\" Carras and Tina sneak up. Tina sends a telepathic message to the ghouls to kill themselves and to one ghoul to cut the ropes that bind Vena. They then turn on the rest of Abbadon's followers while Mallory concentrates on Lady V.\n\nSuddenly, a line of protective green fire goes up around Abbadon. Carras pulls out the rubbing he made and reads, \"He who crosses the Line of Peril shall confront his worse enemy. Only inner faith will triumph over this ordeal.\" Mallory looks to Carras, but he throws away his cross. His faith has crumbled, and he cannot help. The deed falls to Mallory. Concentrating all her faith, Mallory steps across the flames. An ax takes shape in her hands. Suddenly, she is facing herself in her wedding gown and herself as an executioner. \"You can't escape the Evil inside of you,\" says one of them. \"Good and Evil are two faces of the same monster,\" says the other. They take swings at Mallory with their axes. Mallory tosses away her ax and ducks. Mallory the bride and Mallory the executioner cancel each other out, and now it's just Mallory and Abbadon face-to-face.\n\nThe sky opens up, and Abbadon attempts to force Mallory back, but she struggles to approach him. When it's apparent that there is no stopping her, Mallory grabs the edict from Abbadon's hands and eats it, mumbling, \"Fut toi!\" She tosses Abbadon down the stairs, the sky closes up, and Abbadon and Lady V tuck tails and run. \"I lost the battle, but not the war!\" screams Abbadon as he goes through a door into the interstellar void, tumbling...tumbling...\n\nEpilogue: Mallory visits the grave of her demon hubby and gives him back his wedding ring, releasing him from limbo (re: Necronomicon, chapter 112). Lady Valentine moves to the island of Izu, Japan and becomes a special correspondent on the television. The Commandos head for Japan. [Original synopsis by bj_kuehl]"

    "Blue Beetle": "Somewhere in the frozen wasteland, an expedition from Kord Industries, led by mercenary Ignacio Carapax, locates an alien Scarab, and delivers it into the hands of Victoria Kord, the company's CEO.\n\nIn Palmera City, new college graduate Jaime Reyes returns home to his father Alberto, mother Rocio, sister Milagro, uncle Rudy, and Nana. After catching up, Jaime finds out that his family have fallen upon hard times while he was away. New developments by Kord Industries are slowly gentrifying his hometown, leading to his father losing his business, and the family are in dire threat of losing their home. On top of everything, Alberto has developed heart problems. Jaime is confident that he can get a good job with his college degree and support them, but despite his credentials, no one will hire him. Milagro gets him a job with her as a cleaner at Victoria Kord's mansion, meanwhile, Victoria finds that her niece, Jenny Kord, has come to confront her about a defunct superpolice technology called the One Man Army Corps (OMAC) that her father, former CEO Ted Kord, had ordered scrapped before his sudden disappearance. Victoria has revived the project and is developing it to sell to world powers, using a strange new tech. Jenny demands Victoria stop the OMAC project, as her father had turned Kord Industries away from weapons manufacturing, but Victoria refuses. Jaime sees her threatening Jenny, and steps in to defend her, leading to him and Milagro getting promptly fired. Jenny appreciates the gesture however, and tells Jaime to see her at Kord Tower so she can arrange another job for him and his sister. After a pep talk from his father, Jaime decides to take Jenny up on her offer.\n\nJaime goes to Kord Tower, but is made to wait in the lobby. Elsewhere in the building, Jenny find's the source of OMAC's new technology; the Scarab. She steals it and runs, Jaime seeing her in the lobby and trying to catch up with her. As the alarm is sounded, Jenny panics and gives Jaime the Scarab, hidden in a burger box, and orders him to guard it, but never touch or even look at it. He confusedly agrees and takes it home. His family convince him to open the box and they examine the strange statuette. Upon being picked up, the Scarab suddenly comes to life and attaches itself to Jaime, painfully fusing to his back and encasing him in a set of alien armor. The Scarab speaks to him, and begins a check of its systems, launching him into space, sending him back to earth, and flying him helter skelter through the city causing damage before eventually returning him home. The family argue about what to do, Rudy insisting they not get the police involved, convinced that they work for Kord. Desperate to get the Scarab removed, Jaime decides to find Jenny and get some answers. He finds Jenny fleeing armed enforcers, and helps her get away. Jenny knew about the Scarab, as it had been in her father's possession long ago, but didn't know it would bond with Jaime, as it is sentient, and chooses it's own host. The only chance of getting it off him might be in her father's vault, but they will need a digital key stored at Kord Industries. Rudy takes them and sets off a homemade jamming device to block the cameras while Jaime and Jenny enter to steal the key, a smartwatch. Jenny explains that Victoria was Ted's older sister, but their father left the company to Ted. Victoria became bitter, and has been obsessed with progress and profit ever since. The jamming device gives out, and the group is attacked by Carapax in a prototype OMAC suit. The Scarab activates Jaime's suit, and he fights a losing battle with the bodyguard. The Scarab offers to take full control of Jaime's body, and demonstrates the suits capability of creating any weapon at will. However, Jaime stops the Scarab from killing Ignacio, which allows him to defeat the younger man and nearly kill him, but Rudy and Jenny ram Carapax with the jamming device and evacuate the injured Jaime. On the way, Jaime reveals the Scarab is named Khaji-Da, learning so after it took over his body and he temporarily merged with it's consciousness. They go to Jenny's dad's old mansion, and using the key, she takes them into a secret basement lair where Ted operated as the superhero Blue Beetle. He had the Scarab, which he deduced to be some kind of alien super-weapon, but it chose not to bond with him, so Ted created his own gadgets and suit from scratch. Rudy starts to hack Ted's computer while Jaime and Jenny head upstairs. The Scarab heals Jaime's wounds, and he and Jenny talk. Jenny's mother was the one that inspired her father to take up hero work and turn the company around, but after her death he became removed and obsessed. One day he disappeared, never to return. She admires Jaime's close family relationships, and they nearly kiss before Rudy tells them he has broken into the computer.\n\nRudy finds out that the Scarab once fused with someone else, who was analyzed to create the prototype OMAC suit, but the project with shut down before it could be completed. Once the Scarab chooses a host, it merges with them on a cellular level, and does its best to protect the bearer. Unfortunately, the only way to remove the Scarab is to kill the host. Jaime is disheartened, and Rudy talks with him outside, encouraging him that maybe the Scarab is a gift instead of a curse. They see Victoria's helicopter headed towards the Reyes home, and Jaime races back. Victoria's army of enforcers storm the Reyes house and round up the family, demanding to know where their son is and setting fire to the house. Jaime arrives and the suit withstands their attacks, so they start targeting his family. Jaime defeats most of the soldiers, but Alberto and Milagro are pinned down by a soldier as Victoria and Carapax prepare a special weapon. Jaime and Khaji-Da take out the soldier, but Alberto begins suffering a heart attack, distracting Jaime long enough for Carapax to catch him in an electrified claw that incapacitates him. Carapax abducts Jaime as his father dies before the ambulance can arrive. In the morning, Rocio, Milagro, and Rudy are rallied by Nana to put their grief aside for the time being and save Jaime. Jenny offers to help, and takes them back to her childhood home. She brings them into Ted/Blue Beetle's Bugship, an armored airship, and head out to plan a rescue.\n\nJaime is held prisoner inside an old island fortress near Cuba, where the OMAC is being developed. Victoria plans to download the Scarab's code into the OMAC neural systems, and duplicate it to create thousands of super-soldiers, unconcerned that the process will likely kill Jaime. Her lead scientist argues that they could learn more from the Scarab if they keep the host alive, but Victoria orders him to start extracting the Scarab's code into Carapax. Meanwhile, Jenny leads the Reyes family to the island, where Nana formulates a plan to storm the base using Kord's old tech. They land the ship amidst heavy fire, converting it into a walking tank-like vehicle, and blaze through the enforcers' ranks. Milagro heads into the labyrinthine tunnels with Jenny to find her brother. They duck into a side room to avoid the guards, and find that Victoria has already constructed thousands of OMAC units waiting for hosts, which are being powered up by the Scarab. In the lab, Jaime is put through excruciating pain from download, and his organs start to shut down. As he passes out, he sees a vision of Alberto, who encourages him to embrace his destiny and accept the Scarab instead of fighting against it. Jaime says goodbye to his dad, and reaches out to Khaji-Da while Jenny and Milagro place explosives on the generator. Jaime fully merges with the Scarab as the explosives go off, shutting down the extraction, but not before Carapax's OMAC suit is fully powered and operational. Jaime escapes his restraints, but the Scarab needs time to reboot. He is helped by the scientist, who is killed by Carapax in his newly transformed suit. Jaime runs, but is cornered by soldiers. Nana arrives and eliminates the enforcers, expertly operating a machine gun, and revealing she used to be a revolutionary in her youth. They make it back to the ship, but Milagro and Jenny have not returned, so Jaime goes back in to find them, along with Rudy. The explosion has separated the two girls, and Jenny is captured by Victoria and her guards. Milagro is pinned down, but Jaime finds her just in time. Now completely symbiotic with the Scarab, he easily takes down the soldiers and saves his sister, but is found and engaged by Carapax. A fierce fight ensues, Jaime eventually being beaten down by the bigger, stronger warrior. Rudy emerges and Carapax sends a rocket after him, seemingly killing him. Enraged, Jaime gains the upper hand, and prepares to take revenge for his father and uncle and kill Carapax, but is forcibly stopped by the Scarab. Now understanding compassion since merging with Jaime, it tells him what it saw upon being briefly downloaded into Ignacio's own mind, showing that he was conscripted as a child soldier as a young boy, how Victoria found him and took him to be her guinea pig for the OMAC project, and how his mother was killed by a random and senseless bomb attack, turning him into the cold hearted man he became. Jaime takes pity on him, and spares his life. Meanwhile, Victoria attempts to escape in a helicopter with Jenny in tow, showing her that even though if she loses the island facility, she has the Scarab's code in a portable device, and can start over. Jenny uses a protective foam gadget her dad left her to take out the pilots and throw herself and Victoria out of the helicopter to the ground safely. Jenny destroys the duplicated Scarab code, and Victoria orders Carapax to kill them. However, Carapax turns on her as the others escape, reuniting with a very much alive Rudy. Carapax overloads his suit, taking Victoria, the fortress, and all of the OMAC units with him as it explodes.\n\nThe Reyes family grieve for Alberto, and the community rallies around them for support. Jenny takes over as CEO of Kord Industries, and promises to uphold her father's legacy. She gives Rudy a new truck, and tells them she will have her company rebuild the Rayes' home. Jenny says she is heading to her father's mansion, and Jaime offers to fly her there, and they share a kiss.\n\nDeep within the Blue Beetle's lair, a garbled transmission from Ted Kord desperately tells his daughter that he is still alive."

    "Blue Demon": "Husband and wife Nathan, and Marla Collins are head researchers in the \"Blue Demon\" project, a project that involves planting computer chips into the brains of six sharks to be used for protecting the country. As a result of budget cuts, however, the electric fence used to keep the sharks near the marine lab is rendered without electricity, resulting in the sharks chewing a hole through it, escaping the enclosure, and attacking a group of college girls swimming in a nearby lake, eating one of them. Nathan, and Marla are also having a divorce, with the divorce papers ready to be filed. Six weeks later, General Remora is sent to oversee the operations, with Nathan, Marla, and the project's financier Lawrence Van Allen giving a demonstration of the sharks' abilities. However, they're all found to have escaped, eating two divers that were sent to repair the hole in the fence, before going into a lake. They attack a father, and daughter who are fishing, although both manage to evade them.\n\nWhen possible ties to a terrorist organization are discovered, Nathan is suspected, and taken into custody. Marla breaks him out, and they attempt to warn the Coast Guard of the sharks, although to no avail. Van Allen, in the meantime, initiates a manhunt to find them. Marla tells Nathan that she discovered that the program used to control the sharks is actually a shadow program overlaying a real program used by an unknown hacker to control the sharks. They realize that somebody has been working on the inside. Meanwhile, a fisherman who was fishing with the father, and daughter kills one of the sharks with a harpoon gun after it attacks a couple in the lake. Nathan, and Marla, meanwhile, discover that the sharks are heading towards a beach. While Marla attempts to regain control of their chips, Nathan attempts to warn beach-goers of the sharks. One is soon eaten by a shark, and Nathan is knocked unconscious while trying to evacuate other beach-goers.\n\nNathan awakens in a hospital where Marla reveals that she accidentally overloaded the chips, presumably killing all of the sharks. However, Nathan recalls only seeing four sharks at the beach. Van Allen arrives, and tells them about the fisherman killing one of the sharks. They soon realize that their computer technician Avery Dashlow is controlling the alpha shark, \"Red Dog\". They go back to the lab to confront him, although Remora arrives, and reveals that he was the one who created the shadow program; Avery is his accomplice. He's doing it in order to increase the U.S.'s security by making them more aware of terrorist matters, using Red Dog as an asset to place bombs in various areas. Marla then subdues Remora while Avery attempts to escape.\n\nNathan, and Marla chase Avery outside to discover a secret lab inside a truck. They discover that Red Dog is carrying a Russian plutonium bomb, set to detonate it near the Golden Gate Bridge. Avery then injures Nathan, and locks Marla in the truck, and he attempts to drive away. Nathan engages in a chase with them, and Marla manages to regain control of Red Dog. In the ensuing chaos, Avery crashes, and is killed while Marla survives. Red Dog then begins to head back to the lab as a result of a default setting. Van Allen locks Remora in a room that the shark is approaching. The bomb then detonates, killing both Remora, and Red Dog.\n\nSometime later, Nathan, and Marla are preparing to go to court with Van Allen to discuss their involvement in the project. Marla reveals that she didn't file the divorce papers, and the two kiss before heading inside."

    "Blue Iguana": "Eddie and Paul are Americans out on parole and working for the very demanding Louie in a greasy spoon. Paul is quirky, acts like a spoiled brat and wants to make movies and Eddie likes comic books. The viewer occasionally gets to see one of the comic books he's reading, and no, the hero is not Blue Iguana.\n\nKatherine, a pretty English lawyer, comes in the restaurant to make a deal with Eddie and Paul. She knows what they are capable of doing, and she offers $20,000 each if they will help her with a job in London. They want $30,000 each, and they want to avoid hurting anyone and she reluctantly agrees. As for how to get Louie to let them off work, Katherine has heard enough of his conversation with them to tell Louie she can get him in lots of trouble.\n\nSo the three travel to London (laws are broken to get the guys there, as we find out when she needs to use this against them) and meet with Katherine's cousin Tommy and Cornelius, who we later learn was passed over for Elijah Wood in the role of a Hobbit because he was too tall (or that's what he says).\n\nThe job is simple. At a museum, Paul and Eddie steal what looks like a children's backpack, and is referred to as a \"rucksack\". Someone who looks like Ken Jennings gets in the way and the blue bag, as it is called, is gone.\n\nSomeone else wants whatever is in that blue bag. Deacon is a really nasty man who runs a pub. Some people call him \"Billy Ray Cyrus\" because of his hair. Late in the movie someone does a bad impression of Cyrus singing \"Achy Breaky Heart\" to make fun of him. Deacon and two bumbling idiots take over a restaurant--the accomplices put on aprons to look like they work there--and Eddie, Paul and Katherine meet and Deacon and his crew get away with the bag.\n\nArkady is a successful businessman and not particularly nice. He is working with Deacon, but Katherine was also supposed to get him the contents of that bag in order to pay off a huge debt. He will settle for being told how to find the Americans. Believing Arkady will kill them, Katherine refuses and once again she owes Arkady a huge debt.\n\nEddie and Paul want to quit but Katherine points out they can now get in so much trouble they will be jailed in Britain.\n\nEddie, Paul, Katherine and Tommy set up a surveillance operation across the street from Deacon's place, in an empty building with street-style art.\n\nEventually, Katherine discovers Arkady is after a valuable diamond called the Blue Iguana, given by a Turkish prince to his fiancee, who then loses it gambling.\n\nAnd so our heroes try various schemes to get their hands on the Blue Iguana and return it to its rightful owner. In one case, they are not allowed in a hotel because a zombie movie is being filmed, but when they set off an explosion for an unrelated reason, they are covered with blood and easily pass for cast members.\n\nPaul manages to convince a tough, intelligent bartender named Dawn he works for NASA and starts a relationship with her.\n\nThere are other incidents which turn violent and people are killed. Katherine also has dirt on Arkady which she can use."

    "Blue Thunder": "In the Metropolitan Police Astro Division of Los Angeles, which controls all police helicopters, the night shift is about to begin. After checking off the list, Captain Braddock (Warren Oates) is looking for the senior pilot Frank Murphy (Roy Schneider). He orders the rookie observer Lymangood (Daniel Stern) to find Murphy. Lymangood finds Murphy in the ready room, playing with his digital wristwatch. In a few seconds, Murphy goes to talk to Braddock, only to find that his regular observer, Montoya, has been transferred to day shift. Instead, he gets the rookie Lymangood.\n\nThe pair takes off in one of the helicopters, and Murphy is able to spot things on the ground, pointing out things even before the rookie can even get his binoculars on it. They respond to a store robbery call, shine the \"midnight sun\" searchlight onto one of the perps, and get shot at for their effort. However, a squad car arrives and officers quickly bring the suspect down. As the helicopter circles overhead, Murphy and Lymangood spot someone creeping up on the officers. They try to give directions, but it's too dark, and Murphy takes the helicopter down, only 10 feet off the ground, and \"dust\" the suspect, drowning him in dust, which gives the officers enough time to subdue the other suspect.\n\nLater that night, they spot an apparently abandoned vehicle, no plates, in the Brentwood neighborhood, pretty upscale. They call it in, and Murphy decides to show Lymangood something interesting. They fly over to nearby Encino, which is outside their patrol area. At 9:30PM, Lymangood is able to observe a very flexible young woman doing some amazing yoga moves in the nude. Unfortunately, they are interrupted. That \"abandoned car\" they spotted earlier was not abandoned. The character inside watches as a black woman drives her Lincoln by, opens her gate, and enters. He quickly follows and places a brick to block the gate so it can't close, and another car roars into the courtyard, smashing into the back of the black woman's car. Then two men emerge from the car and rush forward, one yelling \"get the briefcase!\" as the other tries to subdue the black woman.\n\nThe patrol cars arrive on the scene just as the suspects try to escape, and run back into the yard, and Murphy's air unit arrives overhead, as they observe the ensuing gun battle. The two suspects only have light revolvers, while police are armed with revolvers and shotguns. One suspect is hit and falls face down into the swimming pool. The other tries to climb the fence with the briefcase, but he is spotlighted by the helicopter and police hit him twice. The briefcase falls and splits open, papers fly everywhere in the helicopter's downwash. The black woman is pleading, \"Just let them go! Please!\" as she staggers toward the gunfight. The suspect on the fence returns fire at the police, hitting the black woman instead in the neck. Then three policemen fire, hitting the suspect multiple times, who falls from the fence.\n\nMurphy, watching from above, suddenly has a Vietnam flashback, about being a pilot in a U.S. Army helicopter and about a man in North Vietnamese Army uniform falling after being pushed out of the helicopter by an unseen U.S. serviceman... and the helicopter loses several hundred feet in altitude before he regains control.\n\nA little later, Murphy's unit lands back at the base, and is summoned for a session with an angry Captain Braddock, who grounds both Murphy and Lymangood for that \"stunt\" over Encino, practically hovering right off someone's balcony, instead of patrolling over their assigned area, and may have prevented the assault on City Councilwoman McNealy (the black woman previously shot). McNealy is now in critical condition in hospital. McNealy had always criticized police tactics and this does not make the police look good.\n\nMurphy goes home, checks his phone messages on his anwsering machine, and is about to relax when he hears someone at the door fumbling with the lock. He pulls out his .38 pistol, only to find his girlfriend Kate (Candy Clark) and her son. They have a bit of discussion about their future, and she eventually leaves.\n\nThe following evening, Murphy decides to check out Councilwoman McNealy's residence, now a crime scene, having heard that McNealy has died in the hospital, and the Watts district is in an uproar as racial tentions are starting to escalate. Detectives have already gone through it, retrieving most evidence they can find. However, Murphy is able to find a piece of paper lodged in a tree. Just when he gets back to his car, his pager goes off. He finds a public phone and call back to base... Captain Braddock wants him back at the base ASAP.\n\nMurphy returns to base, only to find Captain Braddock with two strangers dressed in black business suits, who introduce themselves as Mr. Fletcher (David Sheiner) and Mr. Icelan (Paul Roebling). The two 'men in black' announce that Metro is going be the testing ground for a new $5 million goverment built helicopter, and Murphy has been selected as the senior test pilot, and will be observing the demonstration. They get into a van and drive off outside the city. Murphy asks what is this about, Icelan replies that soon, it'll be 1984 Summer Olympics, which will attract all sorts of rabblerousers... terrorists, and what-not. Thus, some contingencies must be planned, such as this thing they're about to see.\n\nThe van drives out into the desert, and approximately at sunrise, they arrive at the test range, along with various other observers: officers from various other law enforcement and military agencies, and many civilian contractors. The demonstration is for this new helicopter nicknamed \"Blue Thunder\", fully armored, and has a chain-gun in the nose capable to dealing out precise firepower. The chopper is also a full surveillance platform, with video, infra-red, and audio capabilities, as well as a \"whisper mode\" which cancels a lot of the noise from the rotor blades, and turbine boost for the two turbines for extra amount of power. It also has access to almost any computer database in the world.\n\nThe chopper makes a impressive demonstration, eradicating red targets (for terrorists) quickly and efficiently, but it does take out a few white targets (civilians) as well. Murphy remarks to Braddock, who replies that one civilian dead for every 10 terrorists is an acceptable ration. Murphy replies sarcastically. When \"Blue Thunder\" lands, Murphy is surprised to recongize the pilot whom is old nemesis: Colonel Cochrane (Malcolm McDowell), the commander of his unit in Vietnam. Cochrane is surprised as well to run into Murphy. It is clear that both men do not like each other very much as Cochrane makes some sarcastic quirks to Murphy who quietly bushes it off. In private, Fletcher and Icelan talk with Cochrane about that they didn't know that he knew Murphy. Cochrane quickly dismisses Murphy as \"no threat\" to the program to Fletcher and Icelan. To make sure of this, Cochrane orders Fletcher and Icelan to have Murphy on a \"check flight\" the next day.\n\nBack at Metro Headquarters, Murphy finds Montoya (Joe Santos) and asks him about that \"note\" he found in McNealy's place which is in Spanish and to translate it for him.\n\nNext day, Cochrane is out first... and sabotages Murphy's helicopter for some reason by tampering with a wire in the engine. During the day, Cochrane pilots Blue Thunder, with Murphy and Lymangood piloting the faulty chopper. Before the flight, Lymangood tells Murphy that he heard that Murphy had actually did a 360 vertical loop in a helicopter. Cochrane walks by and remarks that the move is physically impossible.\n\nAfter a series of maneuvers, Murphy's chopper loses control of the engine and has to auto-rotate to a landing. After failing to land on top of a passing yellow school bus, Murphy crash lands his helicopter on a construction shack instead in the Watts neighhood. The construction workers help Murphy and Lymangood out while keeping a crowd of angry and racist black and Latino citizens at bay.\n\nLater that day, Montoya meets with Murphy for he has translateted the note which tells something about some weird people in the barrio making trouble, and something about \"THOR\". Both Murphy and Montoya have no idea what it stands for.\n\nThe next morning, Murphy confronts Cochrane in a parking garage about his suspicions that he may have sabatoged his helicopter in trying to kill him for some irrational grudge against him steming from their service in Vietnam. Cochrane (clearly revealed as a charming sociopath at this point to the viewers) calmly denies any wrongdoing and tells Murphy that HE is the one who has a problem with him over being too soft-hearted.\n\nA little later, Braddock approaches Murphy claiming that Cochrane had just told him that Murphy threatened him with physical harm in the parking garage (with Cochrane naturally playing-acting as the \"poor, innocent victim\"). Murphy tells Braddock that Cochrane is lying and he has an agenda. Braddock wants to belive Murphy, but tells him to stay away from Cochrane to avoid any further hassles.\n\nThat evening, Cochrane's attempt to kill Murphy apparently didn't prevent both Murphy and Lymangood from flying the Blue Thunder for a test flight at night. Lymangood has previously learns that everything recorded onboard the Blue Thunder goes into a special tape deck below. Murphy and Lymangood take off to test the Blue Thunder.\n\nThe first thing Murphy and Lymangood do is take out the fuse for the cockpit voice recorder, so they can have a private conversation. They agree on where to stash the fuse for later use.\n\nThey find plenty of harmless targets to test the various capabilities. Just as they are returning, they spot Cochrane and Fletcher leaving the Metro building. Instead of returning to base and landing, they decide to follow Cochrane to see what he is up to, and they end up in the Federal Building downtown. Lymangood starts playing with the computer, looking up his own information, and it's amazingly complete. Murphy tries to look up his own info, but gets: \"FILE UNDER REPAIR\". He tries to search Cochrane, and gets a long military service history, as well as \"currently assigned to Project THOR\". An inquiry about Project THOR shows that T.H.O.R. stands for Tactical Helicopter Offensive Response. Murphy orders the whisper mode activated, thermal vision activated, and audio surveillance activated, as they search the Federal Building for Cochrane, and they find him, along with other people in the project, discussing the killing of McNealy, about how McNealy realized that they're stirring up trouble so she HAD to go, and how Murphy is becoming a problem and will be taken care of soon. Cochrane eagerly offers to kill Murphy himself and claims that he wished he had done it in Vietnam. The group agrees and permits Cochrane to kill Murphy whenever he feels the time will be right. It is right then when Cochrane looks out the window... only to see Blue Thunder looking back at him! Blue Thunder quickly returns to base.\n\nAt the base, Lymangood quickly \"borrows\" the code cards to remove the videotape, before any one else can get to it, while Murphy goes to find Braddock to tell him what he heard, only to find Icelan standing beside Braddock in Braddock's office, thus leaving Murphy with no choice but to keep silent. Murphy sees Lymangood removing the videotape from the helicopter, but plenty of people also see him do it.\n\nLater that night, Lymangood returns home, only to find his place burglarized, and a stranger sitting in his chair. Before he can utter a sound, he gets hit from behind and tied up, and his mouth taped up. The same perp who was at the NcNealy attack and a part of the Cochrane conspiracy meeting at the Federal building is outside in his car waiting for them. The two thugs tell Lymangood that they want the videotape, and they are willing to torture Lymangood to get it. They start by breaking one of Lymangood's fingers. Lymangood fakes compliance, and is able to disable the two attackers in his house. After subduing both of them, he runs outside, and the third perp chases him in the car. Lymangood almost gets away except when he runs into a bicyclist and falls, and gets run over by the perp and dies at the scene.\n\nMurphy, who was on the way to Lymangood's house, happens upon the scene as a paramedic team is putting Lymangood into a body bag. Murphy angrily curses at himself, but he knows that he has to get away, for whoever killed Lymangood will pin the killing on him. Murphy gets away before a squad car arrives on the scene.\n\nThe next morning at Astro Division HQ., Murphy sneaks into the main hangar and into Blue Thunder. He reinserts the fuse into the cockpit voice recorder and finds Lymangood's last audio message: he hid the videotape in a dumpster out by a drive-in theater's projection shack. Murphy is deciding what to do when a mechanic knocks on the window and shouts: \"Hey! You're not supposed to be in there!\" Murphy thinks for a second, then pulls his pistol and points it at the mechanic, who quickly flees. Murphy quickly dons the helmet and starts the engines, and takes off. While Cochrane and others are deciding what to do next, they see Murphy take off in Blue Thunder.\n\nMurphy quickly uses the mobile operator on board the helicopter to place two phone calls, one to Alf Hewitt (James Murtaugh), a Channel 8 investigative reporter, and one to Kate asking her to go find the tape at the dumpster and deliver it to the Channel 8 studio. Cochrane and the members of the conspracy overhear Murphy's two phone calls and decide to kill him before he goes public with what he knows.\n\nKate arrives at the drive-in theater. Seeing no one, she crashes through the front gate. The cleaner sees this and quickly calls the police. After some frantic searching, Kate finds the videotape, but only by jumping into the dumpster herself. She pulls it out just as a police car arrives. Murphy returns to escort Kate to the Channel 8 news building. Kate, being a pretty crazy driver, is able to evade pursuit by several police cars.\n\nMeanwhile, a SWAT team armed with heavy machine guns have boarded two helicopters, and have appeared on either side of Murphy. However, Murphy does not react at first. When one helicopter opens fire, Murphy responds by knocking the front searchlight off the shooter, then puts just a few bullets into the engine to force the helicopter down. The other chopper opens fire, but with little effect since most of the bullets bounce off harmlessly at Blue Thunder's thick armor. Murphy flies down into the L.A. reservoir channels, and in a series of tight turns, the police chopper, heavily laden, is unable to make a turn and crashes into a pillar, fortunately suffering no casualties.\n\nBack on the ground at police headquarters, Cochrane and his team are portraying Murphy to reporters and everyone else as a madman who killed his partner and is now in the sky doing terrorist acts (having fabricated Murphy's personnel file to include a vast list of false crimes). They convince Braddock and the local mayor (Jason Bernard) to ask the Air Force for help. Two F-16 fighter jets are scrambled.\n\nElsewhere, Kate is driving calmly when another police car recognizes her after being contacted by Cochrane to detain her. She tries to evade, but her small car cannot outrun a police car. She is stopped on a bridge when cornered by two police cars. The officers, with pistols drawn, order her out of her car when Murphy shows up in Blue Thunder. When the officers are distracted, she drives away. Murphy activates the cannon and fires a quick burst, cutting a police car in half and forcing the rest of the police cars to flee, but again causing no police casualties.\n\nKate makes it to Channel 8 news station. She has the tape still in the \"eraser\" container, which can be remotely activated to erase the contents of the tape. She enters and finds the lobby in chaos from the people asking about what is going on. She looks for Alf Hewitt, but she is told by the lobby receptionist that he's busy on a story. Just then, Fletcher arrives and pretends to be Hewitt's producer, and tries to charm the supicious Kate to give him the tape. Hewitt appears and is ready to take Kate away, and claims that has never saw Fletcher in his life. Fletcher tries to fight them for the tape, and pulls out a gun. The lobby security guard strikes Fletcher behind the ear with his gun knocking him out. Fletcher still has the grip on the cover, and as he falls, he pulls the cover off the tape. Just then, Cochrane and his boss (unable to find the code to the video cover to erase the tape) orders the \"eraser\" activated for all the videotapes, but it's too late for the tape is no longer in the cover.\n\nMeanwhile, the two Air Force fighters are approaching downtown L.A. Murphy sees them, then slows to a hover... right above the smokestack of a barbeque shack in nearby Chinatown. When one of the F-16 fighters opens fire with a Sidewinder missile, it goes astray and blows up the BBQ restaurant to bits, raining chicken all over the area. The two jet fighters fly off to regroup. The other fighter decides to take a shot. This time, Murphy hovers between the Arco towers over downtown, just as a SWAT team arrives to order everyone out of the area. The Sidewinder missile, delfected by the reflection of the sun onto the building, hits the Arco Tower instead, raining debris down below.\n\nThe two fighters circle, but Murphy's not done. He activates the cannon, and with a long-range burst, catches one of the F-16's in the wing. The pilot ejects while the second F-16 retreats.\n\nAt Astro Division HQ, a Hughes MD5 Defender chopper has arrived, armed with two powerful 20mm guns with armor-piercing bullets. Cochrane suddenly orders the existing pilot out as he'll fly the thing... wanting to kill Murphy himself. Cochrane requests permission to take off. The mayor, having lost two police helicopters, a BBQ shack, one F-16, AND a part of a skyscraper, has had enough, and denies permission to take off. Cochrane takes off anyway, with steel-like determination to kill Murphy.\n\nMeanwhile, Alf Hewitt and Kate are watching the tape in his office, and Hewitt was amazed at the content: it's a Federal government conspiracy to stir up trouble in the barrio, so that they can get funding for this armed helicopter program! Thus, Murphy is not only NOT insane, he could be \"the hottest thing since Horatius at the bridge\", according to Hewitt. He makes a call to someone.\n\nBack up in the air, Murphy is watching the F-16 pilot drifting back down to earth under his parachute when the evil Cochrane attacks from his blind-side. The heavy cannons punch through the cockpit and wound Murphy, causing damage to the Blue Thunder chopper, as well as jam the nose turret into a \"straight-ahead\" position. Murphy quickly goes into evasive maneuvers, as the two adversaries dogfight among the skyscrapers and landmarks of the city in a climatic aerial battle. Murphy tries to set an ambush by turning around and hovering behind a building and opens fire, but Cochrane gets away, as his lighter armored chopper is faster and more maneuverable. And with a bit more maneuvering, he's right back behind Blue Thunder and Murphy, who's busy dodging bullets among abandoned factories.\n\nIn another flashback to Vietnam, it is revealed that Cochrane was the soldier who pushed the North Vietnamese soldier out of the hovering helicopter that Murphy was flying, and thus tried to court-marial Murphy for insubordination to cover up the killing.\n\nBack in the present, with Blue Thunder now the hunted, a desperate Murphy decides on a gamble to end it all. He enables the helicopter's turbine boost on both engines, and goes for the 360 vertical loop. Cochrane tries to follow. The Blue Thunder completes the loop, and the cannon is heading up, as Cochrane's chopper is stuck in the sky, trying to loop but can't. Murphy opens fire with the cannon... and Cochrane's chopper explodes, killing the psychopath at last.\n\nAs it begins to get dark, Murphy spots a freight train traveling at a moderate speed. He lands ahead of the train, and tries to get out before the train hits. The train, unable to stop in time, smashes the chopper into pieces in a final big explosion. The final shot shows an exhausted Murphy walking away from the remains of Blue Thunder.\n\nFreeze frame. In a final voiceover by Alf Hewitt, he reports that Murphy ran out of fuel and destroyed the prototype helicopter and he begins to talk more about a goverment conspiracy behind the construction of Blue Thunder."

    "Blues Brothers 2000": "Eighteen years after the events of the original Blues Brothers movie, Elwood Blues is released from prison. He patiently stands by the road, waiting for Jake to pick him up, but Jake never comes. After Elwood waits a whole day, the warden notices him and informs him that Jake died while Elwood was in prison. Instead, a woman named Matara comes to pick up Elwood. Matara works for the Blues Brothers' former drummer Willie, who is now the owner of a strip club. Willie is happy to see his old friend free again and offers him a job as a house musician, but refuses when Elwood asks him if he is interested in reuniting the band.\n\nElwood goes to visit the \"penguin\", Sister Mary, who now works in a hospital. She tells him that the old orphanage has closed, and that Curtis, the orphanage's custodian and father figure to Jake and Elwood, has died. Elwood wallows in self-pity, now knowing he has no family left, no past, no future, nothing. Sister Mary is having none of it, though. She tells Elwood that Curtis had an affair with a married woman and sired an illegitimate son, so Elwood still has, in a way, a foster brother. However, she says this man knows nothing of his real father and advises Elwood against contacting him. She also introduces Elwood to Buster, a 10-year-old troubled orphan, and suggests that he be his mentor. Neither Elwood nor Buster are enthusiastic about the idea.\n\nElwood visits a used car lot and spots a former police car, this one a black and white Ford Crown Victoria. The owner, Melvin Gasperon, asks five hundred dollars for the car. Elwood, with Buster accompanying him, goes looking for his foster brother, against Sister Mary's advice, hoping he will lend him the money. Elwood finds the man, Cabel Chamberlain, to be a commander in the Illinois State Police. He tells Cabel about Curtis, offending him. He also asks him for a loan and asks if he is interested in joining his band. Cabel calls his mother to ask her about Curtis, and she is taken by surprise and does not deny it. Cabel, upset by the news about his real father and outraged by the requests made by Elwood with his long criminal record, throws Elwood out of his office. Outside the building, Buster steals Cabel's wallet. Elwood returns the wallet, but keeps the cash it contained. While Cabel files papers to have Elwood arrested for the theft, Elwood returns to Melvin's car lot to buy the car, which is to become the new Bluesmobile. Melvin says he's moving to New Orleans, and the two men wish each other well.\n\nAt Willie's strip club, Elwood notices Russian mobsters picking up \"protection\" money. He remarks to Willie later that this is not right. Willie sympathizes, but does not dare challenge the mobsters. One night, when Willie is not at the club, Elwood and the bartender Mac get the Russian mobsters falling down drunk, then steal their clothes and leave them bound and gagged in an alley with a note warning them to stop shaking down Willie. When the mobsters are reunited with the rest of their gang, they vow to destroy the strip club in retaliation for the slight.\n\nAnother night, Elwood invites Mac on stage with him, to Willie's mild chagrin, but Mac proves to be a talented singer. At that moment, several members of the Russian mob show up with machine guns and order everyone out of the building. They then shoot up the place and set it on fire. Elwood, with Buster still in tow, escapes along with Mac and Willie through a rear window. As they climb into the Bluesmobile, one of the mobsters recognizes Elwood, and they chase him in another car with their machine guns. Mac drops some nails out the window, puncturing the Russians' tires and causing their car to crash. Willie has now lost his livelihood, and agrees to play music with Elwood.\n\nElwood goes to look for the rest of the band members. Mac and Buster, now with suits like Elwood's, come along for the ride. They locate Matt, the guitarist, and Blue Lou at Matt's Mercedes dealership. This time, Matt's wife approves, if somewhat grudgingly, of Matt and Lou rejoining the band. They find Murph at a call center, and three other members working at a radio station, and they readily agree to rejoin the band. The last member is Mr. Fabulous, now a funeral director. They find him in a cemetery, holding a funeral for one of the Russians. Mr. Fabulous initially resists rejoining the band, but Elwood and Mac loudly make remarks that make the Russian mobsters think that he is planning to rob the grave. The Russians draw their guns, and Mr. Fabulous flees with the rest of the band members.\n\nWith all surviving members reunited, plus Mac and Buster, the band goes to see their former booking agent, Maury Sline. Maury suggests they enter an upcoming Battle of the Bands contest in New Orleans, and sets up a gig for them to play on the way there, at a county fair in Cynthiana, Kentucky. In the Bluesmobile and an additional car, the band leaves Chicago. Meanwhile, no one at Sister Mary's hospital has seen Elwood or Buster for a week, and they start to think Elwood has kidnapped Buster. They go to the police, and the FBI gets involved. Elwood's description gets passed to police agencies in neighboring states.\n\nThe band stops for dinner at Bob's Country Kitchen (the former Bob's Country Bunker) in Kokomo, Indiana. A trooper with the Indiana State Police happens to spot the car there. The police enter to arrest Elwood, but he is able to create a diversion and escape with Mac and Buster. The rest of the band shrugs off Elwood's antics, but they quickly leave when Bob starts to recognize them from their stunt in the original movie. Gradually, Elwood and Buster begin to warm up to each other.\n\nElwood is able to elude the policemen that night, but the police set up a massive roadblock at a bridge over the Ohio River the next day, where Elwood would have to cross to get to Kentucky. Elwood sees the police, and drives the Bluesmobile straight through the river, as if it was a submarine. When they reach the Kentucky side, they interrupt a meeting of a redneck militia group and accidentally destroy their boat, which was filled with explosives.\n\nThe police are looking for Elwood's car in Cynthiana, so they paint it white before arriving at the county fair. The rest of the band, in the other car, arrives before Elwood's car and only then discover that they are expected to play not blues, but bluegrass. Unseen by either the band or the police, one of the Russian mobsters also comes to the fair and climbs a scaffold, intending to shoot Elwood from it. Elwood, seeing all the policemen, invites the spectators to come out of the bleachers and crowd the stage, which hinders the police. The band begins playing \"Ghost Rider\", to the delight of the spectators. While they are playing, a heavy thunderstorm arrives over Cynthiana. The wind knocks over tents, the sudden driving rain interferes with the Russian mobster trying to aim his gun and washes the hastily applied white paint from the Bluesmobile. Buster grabs a harmonica and plays, and for the first time, Elwood is impressed with him. However, the police are still moving in, so Elwood uses a remote control to guide the Bluesmobile to the stage. As soon as they are done playing, they cram into the car and flee, abandoning their instruments. Lightning strikes the Russian mobster's scaffold, ending any chance he had to shoot Elwood.\n\nThe band continues south, but they run out of gas somewhere in Mississippi. Some of the band members walk toward the nearest town, and find a tent revival meeting, where Reverend Cleophus James, from Chicago, will be preaching. Elwood knows Cleophus and hopes to ask him for gas money, so they sit down for the service. Meanwhile, one of the other band members goes in a different direction and is able to obtain gas by himself. The police catch up to the band at the tent, Cabel Chamberlain among them, intending to arrest Elwood. Cleophus's music causes Cabel to have a religious awakening; the music is in his blood. He decides to join the band rather than arrest them. The other policemen think Cabel has been brainwashed somehow.\n\nThe remaining band member brings the freshly gassed Bluesmobile to pick up the rest of the group. Dozens of police cars from at least four states chase them. At a road construction site, Elwood jumps over some heavy equipment in the Bluesmobile, but the pursuing police cars crash into it, allowing the band to escape.\n\nThe band finally arrives in New Orleans, and goes to the mansion of Queen Mousette to audition for the Battle of the Bands. Queen Mousette was reputed to be ancient, ugly, and cannibalistic, but the band discovers she is none of these. She asks them to play Caribbean music. Elwood protests that music is not part of their repertoire, but Mousette puts a spell on them and they play the music requested. Mousette is impressed and invites them to compete the next day, but Elwood, Mac, and Cabel are transformed into zombies until their turn comes up.\n\nA large crowd enters the mansion to see the Battle of the Bands. The band that goes before the Blues Brothers is called the Louisiana Gator Boys, and they include, among others, Melvin Gasperon, the man who sold Elwood the car. After they play their number, the zombie spell is removed from Elwood, Mac, and Cabel, and the Blues Brothers take their turn. The emcee asks the audience to cheer for their favorite band, and the Gator Boys are declared the winners.\n\nJust then, the Russian mobsters and the redneck militia both arrive at the mansion looking for Elwood, but since neither armed group has yet met the other, each considers the other group potentially hostile, and they turn on each other. Mousette intervenes and casts a spell, turning both the Russians and the rednecks into rats. The Blues Brothers and the Gator Boys jam together.\n\nSister Mary arrives next, with more policemen, to find Elwood, Mac, Buster, Cabel, and the rest of the band still jamming. Cabel assures them that he is all right, but the police still suspect Elwood of kidnapping Buster. While the rest of the band members continue to play, Elwood and Buster slip out and drive away in the Bluesmobile, still pursued by police, toward an unknown fate."

    "Body of Lies": "Towards the start of the movie Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe), speaks to his CIA superiors. He explains to them how terrorists are turning their back on technology by throwing away their phones and computers and using old methods of communicating face-to-face and with written messages. This terrorist retreat into the stone age paradoxically makes the strengths Hoffman has to deploy worthless and increases his dependence on Ferris and his human intelligence.\n\nRoger Ferris (DiCaprio) is a CIA paramilitary operations officer. He is in Iraq trying to track down a terrorist called Al-Saleem. While following a lead, Ferris's asset (with whom he has become good friends) is killed during a car chase involving terrorists, rocket-propelled grenades and two missile-firing U.S. helicopters. Ferris recovers from his injuries at a U.S. facility in Qatar before he is sent to Jordan to run down some intelligence he recovered in Iraq. Meanwhile, unknown terrorists plan to follow up an offscreen series of bus bombings in Sheffield, with more attacks in Manchester but blow themselves up when the police find their cell.\n\nFerris and his handler Hoffman are strongly contrasting characters: Ferris acts on the human scale, relying heavily on trust and human intelligence. Hoffman is more Machiavellian, and keeps tabs on Ferris via a Sikorsky Cypher UAV.\n\nIn Jordan, Ferris tosses the ineffectual Station Chief out of his office before meeting Hani Salaam (Mark Strong), head of the Jordanian General Intelligence Department (GID). Salaam and Ferris form a fragile and complex bond. Salaam is deeply aware that whatever he thinks of Ferris, his duty is to his country, while Ferris acts for the CIA, whose interests cannot intersect with those of Jordan. Salaam demands one thing of Ferris -- never lie to him.\n\nHoffman finds an Al-Saleem safehouse in Jordan and orders Ferris to conduct a surveillance operation on it covertly. Simultaneously, he organises another operative Skip (Vince Colosimo) to conduct an operation without Ferris's consent. Skip botches the operation, blowing his cover by divulging compromising information to a terrorist from the safehouse. As the terrorist takes off, running, and intent on releasing the information that the safehouse has been compromised, Ferris makes chase: bitten by dogs in the run, Ferris ultimately kills the runner. Hani covers up the killing by passing it off as a robbery and Ferris accuses Hoffman of running \"side operations\", telling Hoffman to lay off. Tending his wounds in hospital, Ferris meets a nurse named Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani). Around them, the swirl of terror animating the action continues as cell phone-triggered bombing in an Amsterdam flower market that kills at least 75 people.\n\nHaving recognised one of the men living in the safehouse as well-known suspect Mustapha Karami (Kais Nashif), Hani takes Karami out into the desert and coerces him into working for Jordanian intelligence, threatening to set him up as a collaborator if he does not cooperate (he has been sending money to Karami's mother and making it appear as if it came from her reformed and successful son, so she doesn't know Karami is still a thief and now an aspiring Al Qaeda terrorist, and he is shamed and surprised when Hani does not kill him but lets him ride away on his bicycle). Hoffman asks Hani to hand Karami over to the CIA, most likely to interrogate him but Hani refuses, having earlier told Ferris he does not believe in torture. Unknown to Ferris and Hani, Hoffman tells Ferris's CIA subordinate to follow Karami and kidnap him. Karami gets away and notifies the terrorists in the safehouse that it is being watched, resulting in the safehouse being lit on fire and abandoned. Ferris's partner is caught and Hani professes his belief that Ferris had knowledge of the move on Karami and therefore blames his lack of honesty with Hani for the destruction of the safehouse. Hani gives Ferris 12 hours to leave Jordan.\n\nFerris comes back to the States for a while and argues with Hoffman, whom he derides as power-hungry and fat. He then comes up with a plan to make contact with the terrorist Al-Saleem by staging a significant terrorist attack, the logic being that Al-Saleem will hear about this attack and try to make contact with the terrorist group who committed it. With the help of one of Hoffman's CIA friends, Ferris is able to frame a Jordanian architect named Omar Sadiki by posing as a financier contracting a bank's construction in the UAE, making him look like the head of a terrorist cell.\n\nThe \"terrorist attack\" is staged at the Incirlik Air Base in Turkey. A bomb is exploded in the base and Ferris uses unclaimed local bodies dressed as soldiers to make it seem that soldiers were killed in the attack. Al-Saleem (Alon Abutbul) sees the report of the attack on television and tries to make contact with Sadiki.\n\nHani tells Ferris to come back to Jordan because he knows that he needs Ferris. Hani then talks to Ferris about his suspicions that Omar Sadiki is a terrorist. Ferris hides that this is not the case, and acts as if he doesn't know anything concerning Hani's suspicions. Ferris later tries to save Sadiki from being kidnapped by Al-Saleem's henchmen but fails and sees another CIA agent nearly killed in the subsequent car crash. Sadiki informs Al-Saleem that Ferris made it seem he committed the terrorist attack. Sadiki is killed. Ferris goes back to his apartment and finds out that Aisha, in whom Ferris is romantically interested, has been kidnapped. He then desperately asks Hani for his help, explaining to Hani that he made up Omar Sadiki's terrorist cell and the terrorist attack supposedly committed by Sadiki was faked. However, Hani refuses to help Ferris because Ferris lied to him.\n\nFerris gets a call from the kidnappers and is told to wait for a van. The van picks him up and drops him in the desert. Meanwhile back in CIA headquarters, Hoffman is watching everything via an unmanned aerial vehicle. Ferris is then picked up by a group of men in SUVs and the vehicles create a massive cloud of dust before splitting up. Hoffman is unable to follow Ferris because he has no idea which car he is in.\n\nFerris is taken to be interrogated by Al-Saleem, just across the border in Syria. When Ferris asks Al-Saleem about Aisha, Al-Saleem tells Ferris that someone has lied to him and he has been double-crossed. Ferris tells Al-Saleem that there is an infiltrator (Karami) in his organization who works for Ferris, and that, by association, Al-Saleem works for Ferris. Al-Saleem smashes two of Ferris's fingers with a hammer before turning on a video camera and ordering Ferris to be killed. Al-Saleem then leaves. Ferris is prepared by Al-Saleem's men to be executed on video. As Ferris is about to be executed, Hani and his team of Jordanian SF burst into the room, killing all of the terrorists. Al-Saleem is seen leaving the building and unwittingly getting into a car driven by Hani's men who arrest him.\n\nWhile in the hospital, Ferris is visited by Hani who reveals to him that it was his men who kidnapped Aisha, using blood she donated regularly at work to make it appear she'd been killed or wounded. He then brokered a deal with Al-Saleem (using Karami): he would deliver CIA agent Ferris to him for money. It was one of Hani's men who rang Ferris and dropped him in the desert. Since Karami was Hani's man inside Al-Saleem's organization, he was able to locate Ferris and Al-Saleem in time to save Ferris and arrest Al-Saleem. Aisha has been released unharmed but does not know what role her kidnapping played.\n\nIn the end Hoffman offers Ferris a job in his office, but Ferris declines and tells Hoffman that he is quitting the CIA. Hoffman prepares to leave Jordan and resigns himself to Ferris not changing his mind. At the movie's end, Ferris seemingly decides to not contact Aisha, therein refuting what Hoffman had repeated numerous times through the movie: no one is innocent. Hoffman is shown speaking with CIA operatives watching Ferris in the market buying pastries, in a box similar to that which he had taken to Aisha's. Hoffman declares that Ferris is no longer an asset. It is left to the viewer to decide whether Ferris leaves Aisha to live her life or becomes involved with her once again."

    "Bodyguard": "Reading from a diary a lad comes to know about a nobleman from Jaisinghpur, Sartaj Rana (Raj Babbar). Sartaj had saved Lovely's dying pregnant mother from a car crash & she gave birth to Lovely & Lovely knows this & has an immense sense of gratitude for Sartaj.\n\nOne day, a woman comes to Sartaj, requesting his help to rescue her daughter, who has been abducted by sex traffickers. The woman alleges that her brother works on the ship MV Arun Sagar, which will be used to transport the girls to Thailand. The police are in cahoots with the kidnappers. Since the ship is docked in Mumbai, Sartaj calls a security agency headed by Bindra (Sharat Saxena) to send his men to free the girls. Instead of sending a force, Bindra sends Lovely Singh (Salman Khan). Upon hearing that this is Sartaj's job, Lovely immediately attends to it. Lovely attacks the docks alone, defeats the junior Mhatre brothers (Chetan Hansraj and Salim Baig) and frees the girls. Sartaj invited the wrath of the Mhatre brothers, Ranjan (Mahesh Manjrekar) and Vikrant (Aditya Pancholi) by disrupting their business.\n\nFeeling threatened by the Mhatre brothers, Sartaj hires Lovely as a bodyguard for his collegian daughter, Divya (Kareena Kapoor), and her friend, Maya (Hazel Keech). Sartaj has plans to marry off Divya to a guy in London after she finishes college. Shekhar (Govardhan Asrani) is the manager of Sartaj's estate, while Surinder Narender Milkha 'Tsunami' Singh (Rajat Rawail) is also a servant of the house.\n\nNow Divya is embarrassed that Lovely accompanies her to college. Divya does not appreciate being followed around by Lovely over the entire campus, including inside the classrooms. Divya specifically hates the formal uniform that Lovely insists on wearing while he follows her. She tries to get rid of him with pranks like burning his uniform, but Lovely simply gets another uniform made overnight. Lovely is also in charge of teaching self defense classes to Divya and Maya and puts them through a grueling physical fitness regime.\n\nDivya then creates a fictional woman, Chhaya, who distracts him by repeatedly phoning him and telling him that she loves him. Divya as Chhaya tells Lovely that she loves his uniform, this prompts Lovely to ditch his uniform and revert to normal clothes, much to Divya's relief. What begins as a prank turns serious as Lovely believes this person to be real and falls in love. Meanwhile Mhatre's men had been searching for Divya and finally locate her.\n\nIn a bar, Ranjan's brother attacks Divya and is killed by Lovely. Sartaj is worried for Divya's safety, but Lovely promises Sartaj to return Divya safely to him, once the college is over.\n\nDivya understands Lovely's devotion to his job & her & falls in love with him & says so as Chhaya. The 3rd Mhatre brother, Vikrant makes an entry and swears revenge on Sartaj.\n\nDivya confesses her love to Maya who advises here not to reveal her feelings to Lovely as he treats Sartaj as God & would never betray his trust by having feelings for Divya.\n\nDivya doesn't listen to Maya & leads Lovely on. Divya tells Lovely that she wants to meet him, and this angers Maya. But when Lovely goes to meet Chhaya, Divya insists on going with him. Divya then hides from Lovely and calls him as Chhaya and says that she believes that Divya has feelings for Lovely and hence refuses to meet him. The idea was to break Lovely's heart and to get him to move on from Chhaya. In one of the phone conversations the maid Savita (Reema Debnath) hears Divya talking to Lovely, taking his name & tells Sartaj. Divya wants to run away with Lovely, but can't tell him that she is Chhaya, so asks him to meet him at railway station. Lovely refuses as he has to return Divya home as her college is over.\n\nSartaj tries to call Lovely to clear the confusion, but Vikram attacks at that moment. This makes Sartaj believe that Savita is telling the truth and that indeed Lovely is running away with Divya. Lovely kills the Mhatre brothers & saves Divya, but this is when Sartaj attacks him. Divya intervenes & tells Sartaj that Lovely loves Chhaya who is waiting at station. Sartaj allows lovely to go but sends an assassin to kill Lovely if no one is waiting for him at the station. Divya sends Maya to Station to save Lovely's life because Lovely's cell phone is lost in the fight. Divya tells Maya to tell Lovely the truth about her. But when Divya calls Maya later, Maya throws her own cell phone away & assumes the identity of Chhaya, whom Lovely accepts.\n\nSartaj calls Lovely several years later, when Maya is dead of cancer & Lovely has a son. He reveals the truth to Lovely & tells him that Divya never married & then hands over Divya to him."

    "Borderline": "The film follows a United States Border Patrol Agent in Charge, Jeb Maynard (Bronson), who is forced to track down the killers of a young Mexican boy and his colleague and friend, a veteran Senior Patrol Agent, \"Scooter\" Jackson, portrayed by (Wilford Brimley). Jeb Maynard is the Patrol Agent in Charge of the \"fictional\" Otay Border Patrol Station, located in the hills east of San Diego, CA. Otay Station is a composite of the actual El Cajon, CA and Brown Field, CA Border Patrol Stations. He is helped by the young boy's mother, Elena Morales, (Karmin Murcelo) and a rookie Border Patrol Agent, Jimmy Fantes, (Kirby).\n\nSenior Patrol Agent Jackson and the young boy are murdered by Hotchkiss, a ruthless alien smuggler, also called \"the Marine\" by the aliens, portrayed by (Ed Harris). The murders take place when a truckload of illegal aliens being smuggled by Hotchkiss is stopped by Senior Patrol Agent Jackson while on routine road patrol. The truck has boxes of tomatoes on top of a hidden roof on the back of the truck. Under the roof is a hidden compartment containing the load of illegal aliens. Hotchkiss shoots \"Scooter\" from a concealed position in the back of the truck with a sawed-off shotgun at close range. The Mexican boy is badly wounded by stray buck shot so Hotchkiss finishes him off with another blast from his shotgun. Hotchkiss drags the bodies into the bushes along the side of the road and conceals the Border Patrol sedan in the same bushes. The other alien smuggler driving the truck with Hotchkiss becomes very nervous about the murders so Hotchkiss later kills him to keep him silent after they drop off the load of illegal aliens at a local fruit ranch, owned by well to do fruit farmer Carl Richards, and used as a front to smuggle aliens. Hotchkiss later abandons the truck used to smuggle the aliens along a rural road. Hotchkiss leaves the body of the other alien smuggler who was driving the truck the night of the murders, along with the truck, and conceals some small bags of marijuana in the truck to make it appear to be a drug smuggler's vehicle. Other Border Patrol Agents find the bodies of Agent \"Scooter\" Jackson and the boy, and the Border Patrol car later in the morning. Agent Fantes finds some fresh tomatoes near the bodies. Agent Maynard notices some boot prints in the dirt among all the other foot prints at the crime scene. These particular prints were made by a pair of military style boots with some odd markings in the soles. One of a veteran Border Patrol Agent's professional skills is \"sign-cutting.\" \"Sign-cutting\" is the skill to examine, analyze, and interpret tracks and marks made in the ground. Patrol Agents use this skill to track groups of illegal aliens crossing the border. Maynard has Fantes take the tomatoes to the Agriculture department of a nearby university for analysis. The F.B.I. is called to investigate. The F.B.I. has primary juridiction investigating the murder of any federal agents. A couple of days later the abandoned truck is found with the drugs. The F.B.I. agents investigating the murders wrongly conclude that Agent \"Scooter\" Jackson stopped some drug smugglers that night and was shot because of it. Hotchkiss is running a sophisticated and highly profitable alien smuggling operation between Mexico and the United States. Maynard and Fantes start checking the trails in the hills that the smugglers use to bring in illegal aliens and drugs. They find the same military boot prints along a trail where a Border Patrol electronic ground sensor has been dug up and disabled. Hotchkiss is a former U.S. Marine who had been trained on such equipment while in the Marine Corps. He discovered the sensor and disabled it on a prior smuggling run.\n\nJeb Maynard thinks that \"Scooter\" Jackson was murdered by alien smugglers and tries to convince the F.B.I. that the marijuana in the truck was merely a ruse. The F.B.I. does not believe him. After \"Scooter\" Jackson's funeral with full honors, Jeb tells his boss, I&NS Commissioner Malcolm Wallace, about his suspicions. Commissioner Wallace cautions Jeb to proceed carefully in the matter. So Jeb begins his own investigation of the murders with the assistance of Patrol Agent Jimmy Fantes. Maynard had found a piece of paper with a San Diego address on it in the murdered Mexican boy's clothes. Maynard goes to the address and finds the boy's mother, Elena Morales, working at a well to do family's home as their nanny. Maynard takes Elena to the morgue so she can identify her son's remains. Maynard then asks for her help in finding her son's killers. Elena is brave and she agrees. Maynard goes undercover posing as the woman's cousin. They cross into Mexico and she introduces him to an alien smuggler in Tijuana, Mexico who brought her over the border when she last crossed. This smuggler is Hotchkiss's partner in Mexico. Maynard's physical features are such that he can pass for Mexican. Elena tells the smuggler that her cousin is simple minded and doesn't talk much. Jeb Maynard cannot speak Spanish well enough to pass as a native Mexican. Elena pays the smuggler with money Jeb gave her.\n\nThey are smuggled across the U.S.-Mexican border and through the hills east of San Diego into the United States along with a group of thirty illegal aliens. Maynard hears the smuggler guiding the group talking about \"the Marine\" who runs things\" to Elena. But then the group is ambushed by bandits who want to rob the group. Jeb and Elena escape unharmed. Jeb and Elena walk back towards the suburbs of San Diego. Jeb gets Elena home and thanks her for her help. He tell Elena that she should stop by his office the following week and he will try to help her straighten out her immigration status in the United States.\n\nMaynard gets home, cleans up, and tries to get some sleep. Jimmy Fantes stops by Maynard's home to report to him that the agriculture report came back on the tomatoes found at the crime scene. These particular tomatoes were treated with a particular new brand of pesticide. Fantes checked with the local office of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and only a few large farms in the local area use that brand of pesticide. Maynard and Fantes meet later at the Border Patrol station to plan their next move. They put on their Border Patrol uniforms and drive in Jeb's Border Patrol S.U.V. to check the local fruit farms that use that pesticide. They finally end up at Carl Richards's large fruit ranch. Jeb knows of Richards's reputation for hiring illegal aliens for poor wages to harvest his fruit. Hotchkiss is in the main ranch house when Maynard and Fantes arrive. Hotchkiss stays inside the house and Richards goes outside to speak to the Border Patrol Agents. While talking to Richards, Jeb Maynard notices the same style military boot prints in the dirt near the main house that he detected at the crime scene.\n\nJeb Maynard and Jim Fantes set up a surveillance of the Richards Ranch with the assistance of Border Patrol Agents Lambert and Monroe. While using binoculars they see Hotchkiss wearing his combat boots and camouflage marine field jacket departing the house with other smugglers, including the Mexican smuggler who was guiding the group that Jeb and Elena had infiltrated. Maynard has found \"the Marine\". Hotchkiss is planning a large alien smuggling run soon that will bring hundreds of illegal aliens into the U.S. in one evening. Then he plans on shutting down operations for a while until things cool off.\n\nFrom what he witnesses on the surveillance of the ranch over the following days Jeb Maynard deduces Hotchkiss's plans. Maynard get all his agents together at the station and plans an operation for the following evening. The Border Patrol is going to raid the Richards Ranch. Jeb Maynard and his Border Patrol Agents raid the ranch in the late evening/early morning capturing all the illegal aliens and the smugglers bringing them into the ranch's main barn. At dawn Hotchkiss arrives at the ranch with the last load of illegal aliens. As the Patrol Agents attempt to arrest him Hotchkiss pulls out a model MAC-10 nine millimeter machine pistol and fires a burst at the agents. The agents take cover and Hotchkiss jumps in a car and speeds away. Jeb Maynard pursues him in a Border Patrol four wheel drive truck. Hotchkiss attempts to lose Maynard on an old dirt road. The road dead ends and Hotchkiss runs on foot into the surrounding trees and bushes. Maynard draws his Smith and Wesson Model 28 .357 Magnum revolver from its holster and starts tracking Hotchkiss through the forest. Hotchkiss cirlces around back to the vehicles thinking he has given Maynard the slip. Just as Hotchkiss is about to get back in his car Maynard emerges from the treeline with his revolver pointed at Hotchkiss and says, \"the end of the road.\" Hotchkiss wheels about and starts firing his MAC-10 machine pistol at Maynard. Maynard is a better shot and kills Hotchkiss with a single shot from his .357 Magnum.\n\nThe film ends with Maynard and Fantes watching Richards leaving the United States Court House in San Diego, CA after he has been sentenced to three years in federal prison for alien smuggling. Fantes laments that Richards will probably go right back to smuggling aliens within a month of his release from prison. Jeb Maynard responds by saying, It's okay kid, we'll be there waiting for him."

    "Born to Fly": "Two American F-35 Lightning II fighters enter Chinese airspace and cause havoc near the coast. Flying at supersonic speeds, the F-35s create sonic booms that damage an oil refinery and affect local fishing boats. Chinese pilot Lei Yu (Yibo Wang) intercepts the F-35s with his Chengdu J-10. Lei Yu pushes the limits of his craft to compete against the 5th generation fighters; the intruding aircraft then leave the airspace. Lei Yu's craft suffers engine problems including a flame out during a vertical climb, which force him to make an emergency landing.\n\nIn a meeting, Lei Yu's superiors are critical of him pushing the jet that far, but Lei Yu argues it was the only way to fight against a superior enemy. The higher-ups discuss the main issue: foreign 5th generation fighters have a huge advantage over their 4th generation fighters. The Chinese Jet engines are not yet capable to compete with foreign enemy aircraft. Secretly, the Chinese have been developing the 5th generation Chengdu J-20 in order to counter foreign 5th generation threats. Commander Zhang Ting (Jun Hu) invites Lei Yu to join him in the new stealth fighter program and he agrees. The other test pilots include Deng Fang, Gao Yingjun (Yu Bu), Xia Pengfei (Yujia Zhai), Li Xiaohang (Xin Lu), Tong Gan (Zichen Wang) among others. Shen Tianran (Dongyu Zhou) is the evaluating officer of physical fitness tests of all pilots.\n\nAt the training facility, Lei Yu and his squad endure rigorous training by pushing their physical and mental limits. The J-20 is still going through refinement as the prototype WS-13 Taishan engine is incomplete. They've been using alternative jets to test the engine's capabilities before installing it in the J-20.\n\nDuring a flight test with Commander Ting, Lei Yu and Ting lose thrust and enter into a spiral dive. Lei Yu believes the situation is dangerous and ejects, while Ting manages to regain control of the aircraft and land the plane. Due to the ejection, the test data from the flight is lost due to instrument failure. So, Lei risked their lives for basically nothing. The incident gets Lei Yu grounded, and he is expected to leave the training facility. During his grounding, he studies the mechanical flaws and proposes an anti-stall parachute. This parachute will allow the safety of test pilots and aircraft while allowing pilots to collect the crucial limits data without failure.\n\nTing decides to have Lei Yu fly with him on his last day to test the fighter's engine and missiles, when the fighter suffers dual engine failure. The test was to ingest the missile smoke into the engines to see if the engine still performs. But both engines catch fire due to overheating. Ting and Lei Yu agree to eject together, but Ting stays in the aircraft and steers the jet outside of the city in order to prevent civilian casualties, dying in the process. Ting is later given a military burial, while Lei Yu chooses to stay with the squad to complete the J-20. Since Zhang is dead, Deng Fang is appointed the new chief pilot of the unit. Lei Yu refuses to go back home with his parents, even after his father admonishes him that China cannot compete with foreign powers to develop a stealth fighter all by itself. Lei Yu is determined to contribute to China's success.\n\nLei Yu then designs a fighter anti-stall parachute deployment system and tests it extensively in the ground. After extensive testing and modifications, the parachute deployment system works. Meanwhile, the design and engineering team makes changes to the engine so that it can operate with the hot gases from the missile exhaust, without overheating and rupturing.\n\nLei Yu and the chief pilot, Deng Fang (Yosh Yu), test the newest engine after Ting's death. They successfully fire 3 missiles and ingest the smoke into the engines, and it works. While testing the jet's ability to get out of a spiraling dive, a flock of birds strikes the cockpit, knocking out both crew members. Lei Yu manages to recover and attempt to regain control. The fighter has his anti-stall parachute installed and uses it to get the J-11 out of the spin, but the chute can't be ejected. Lei Yu receives orders to eject the aircraft, which would mean abandoning Deng Fang to his death, since he is still unconscious. Lei Yu pushes the engine to rip out the chute and tries to regain control as the blood in his eyes blinds him. He manages to pull up and prove the new improvements worked; this marks the completion of their prototype and onto mass production.\n\nIn a later encounter, American stealth fighters and drones infiltrate Chinese air space again. Lei Yu and Deng Fang launch in their completed J-20s and shoot down the drones. They then proceed to engage the F-35s. Since shooting down the American fighters would lead to an international incident, Lei Yu warns the pilots and the F-35s retreat from the airspace. In a mid-credits scene, Lei Yu and his squadron perform a surprise flyby by deploying colored smoke above a soccer field to show respect to Commander Ting's son."

    "Boss Level": "Roy Pulver, a retired Delta Force soldier in Atlanta, awakens in his loft with a machete-wielding man trying to kill him. He disarms the assassin before a helicopter gunner kills the man believing him to be Roy. Roy kills the gunner causing the helicopter to crash into Roy's loft. Roy leaps from the window into a truck full of sand, carjacks a man and is chased by a pair of assassins. Roy's car is hit by a bus, into which he is thrown and dies. It is revealed that Roy has been reliving the same day for over four months, and is being targeted by multiple assassins. He now knows their locations and strategies.\n\nOn attempt 48, Roy tries to call his estranged wife Jemma. Her phone is answered by her boss, Col. Clive Ventor, head of defense contractor Dynow Labs. Ventor tells Roy that Jemma died the previous evening in an accident in the lab. Roy is suspicious, but is killed before he can act on the information.\n\nIn the unlooped timeline, the day prior, Roy visits Jemma at Dynow Labs, believing she has gotten him a job interview. Jemma and Roy argue over their son Joe, because Jemma has not told him that Roy is his father. Dynow's head of security summons Jemma to speak with Ventor. Jemma reveals that she needs Roy's services, not the company.\n\nOn attempt 143, Roy arrives at Underground Atlanta and spots Joe, Roy follows him into the main arcade area, where he confesses he ditched school to participate in a video game tournament. The assassins arrive, and Roy uses his body as a shield to protect Joe, revealing that he is Joe's father before he dies. Roy realizes he is being tracked and discovers a transmitter in his tooth.\n\nRoy uses the next several resets to probe Dynow's defenses using trial-and-error. On attempt 156 Ventor reveals the truth about the machine in the lab and his plan: it is called the Osiris Spindle, a quantum device capable of rewriting history. Ventor plans to use it to set himself up as the world's dictator. Ventor also confirms his responsibility for Jemma's death. Roy realizes that Jemma used the Osiris Spindle to put Roy in a time loop. A later attempt reveals that the Osiris Spindle can't be shut down and that if it runs too long it will destroy the world. Roy discovers that while he is at Dynow, Joe was being targeted by the other assassins. Roy arrives at the arcade to find police removing Joe's body from the scene. As Roy attempts to get past the police, the Osiris Spindle explodes, destroying the world.\n\nRoy starts spending his days bonding with Joe through various activities. On attempt 249, Roy & Joe have a longer conversation and Joe reveals that he had gotten a voicemail from his mother that morning. Roy sees the timestamp on the message and realizes that Jemma is still alive when he wakes up each morning.\n\nOn a subsequent attempt Roy jumps onto the helicopter and orders the pilot to fly them to Dynow. He knocks out the pilot, uses the minigun to kill all the assassins who tracked him to the facility - thereby saving Joe - and fights his way downstairs just in time to kill Brett & Ventor and save Jemma. Roy reveals he has been spending his attempts being a father to Joe, and that he saw the end of the world. Jemma explains that they may be able to stop the chain reaction if Roy enters the Osiris Spindle, which will send him back to the start of the day one last time. Roy enters the Osiris Spindle, and awakens in his bed."

    "Bound by Honor": "In 1972, Miklo Velka (Damian Chapa) returns home to the Mexican-American barrio in East Los Angles, California, after living with his Caucasian father in Las Vegas, Nevada, for the last 18 months. He reunites with his Mexican mother and cousins Paco Aguilar (Benjamin Bratt) and Cruz Candelaria (Jesse Borrego) days before his 18th birthday. Miklo constantly fights the stigma of being a blond, blue-eyed Mexican. Seeing a gang painting graffiti in his neighborhood, he demonstrates his toughness by sneaking up and smashing their car window.\n\nLater, Cruz Candelaria wins an art competition, and is awarded a scholarship to the Los Angeles College of Art and Design. When Cruz drives a girl to a secluded area for lovemaking, the graffiti-painting gang members, led by Spider, pull him from the car and beat him so badly that he is taken to the hospital in grave condition. Paco and Miklo assemble their gang to retaliate.\n\nOn a hillside in the daytime, Paco stabs Spider repeatedly and carves his gang initials into Spider's chest, but is stopped by Miklo from shooting him. However, as the cousins leave, Spider shoots at them and wounds Miklo, who returns fire and kills him. Paco races Miklo to the hospital in his automobile, prompting police officers to give chase. Paco crashes during the pursuit, and both are arrested, but only Miklo is charged with Spider's murder.\n\nAfter being convicted, Miklo is sent to San Quentin State Prison in Northern California. Elsewhere, Cruz is released from the hospital, but walks with a cane as a result of his injuries. He is surprised when his stepbrother, Paco, greets him wearing a U.S. Marine Corps uniform, and explains that he enlisted to avoid going to prison.\n\nMeanwhile, in San Quentin, Miklo meets fellow inmate \"Chuey,\" whom he knows from the barrio, and learns about the various racial gangs that run the prison. When Chuey tries to stab Miklo, he is stopped by gang leader Montana Segura. Miklo wants to join Montana's gang, but his white skin presents an obstacle for acceptance. He offers to prove his loyalty by killing Montana's nemesis, kitchen manager Big Al.\n\nElsewhere, Cruz resumes painting, and after getting a gallery exhibition, he sells all his canvases on opening night. However, he embarrasses the gallery owner by showing up \"stoned\" with his friends and causing a scene.\n\nAfter befriending Big Al and getting a job in the prison kitchen, Miklo enters the storeroom and finds him engaging in a gambling scheme with a prison guard named Bob. As soon as Bob leaves, Miklo stabs Big Al, and takes the money and notebook ledger. Afterward, Miklo threatens to turn Bob over to the warden if he retaliates.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Cruz begins using heroin to treat the pain from his back injury. His younger brother, Juanito, finds him passed out. Emulating his older brother, he injects himself with one of Cruz's needles and dies of an overdose. Cruz's family, including Paco, disowns him.\n\nMeanwhile in prison, Miklo is accepted into the Mexican gang, and they take over running Big Al's gambling business. Over the next few years, the Mexicans become more powerful in prison, and Miklo is respected as one of the \"top dogs.\" Montana invests their profits in drug businesses outside prison to expand their gains.\n\nIn 1980, Paco has become a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) narcotics officer, and works undercover to bust drug dealers. When Miklo is denied parole, Montana encourages him to earn his release. He begins studying, and after passing his G.E.D. high school equivalency exam, Miklo appeals again to the parole board, and is granted an early release. After nine years of incarceration, he returns home in 1982, and reunites with Cruz.\n\nMiklo moves into a halfway house with former inmate \"Popeye,\" and tries to work a respectable job at a tire factory, but his life depresses him. He is surprised to learn Paco has become a \"narc.\" He rejects Paco's offer to help him rebuild his life, and confides to Cruz that he was making more money in prison. Soon, Miklo agrees to participate in an armored car heist for some thugs when he learns that Cruz owes them money. When Miklo excludes Popeye from the deal, the parolee takes revenge by tipping off police.\n\nPaco and his partner investigate, and witness several masked men robbing an armored truck. A shootout ensues, and Paco chases a robber on foot. As the officer overtakes the robber, Miklo removes his mask, tells Paco that he owes him for taking the rap for Spider's death, and flees despite Paco's warnings. Paco shoots him in the leg, and Miklo loses it in the hospital.\n\nSent back to San Quentin with a prosthetic leg, Miklo learns that the white gang has taken over the prison drug and gambling business. After seven years of silence, Paco visits Cruz, who insults him for shooting Miklo.\n\nMeanwhile, Miklo argues with Montana Segura about how to regain power, but Montana has lost his aggression. He has written an essay on prison reform, and has been asked to write a book on Chicanos in prison. Going behind Montana's back, Miklo recruits an inmate named \"Magic Mike.\" They wait for the right time to make their move, while fighting escalates between the black and white gangs. When Miklo appeals to Montana that they need to strike, the leader demands they speak to the Mexican council before making a move.\n\nMeanwhile, a thug named Smokey asks Paco for protection when his life is threatened. Paco agrees to help in exchange for information on the prison drug-running scheme, but when he arrives at their meeting, Smokey has been murdered. San Quentin Prison Lieutenant Ivan Burnett arrives in Los Angeles to work with Paco on the investigation.\n\nMeanwhile, having receiving approval from the council, Montana offers the Mexican gang's assistance to black leader Bonafide, and agrees to visit a prison in Chino and put an end to the Mexican violence against the black gangs there. Montana leaves Miklo in charge, and shares his excitement that he will get to see his daughter for the first time in fourteen years while en route. Montana spends the night at a jail midway to Chino, but as he prepares for his daughter's visit, he is stabbed to death by an elderly black inmate named Wallace. During the subsequent investigation, Wallace claims he made the hit after receiving a secret message from Bonafide inside a wooden hair comb.\n\nMeanwhile, chaos erupts in San Quentin as inmates riot. Miklo orders his men not to join in, because the prison guards will kill them. Bonafide is stunned to hear that Wallace believes he sent the message to kill Montana. Paco visits Miklo in prison to implore him not to retaliate against the black gang. Bonafide appeals to Miklo to continue their alliance, claiming the white gang set him up. Miklo tells Bonafide they will wait six-months, and then attack the white inmates when they least expect it. Paco and the prison warden are relieved at the apparent peaceful resolution.\n\nSix months later, on the Mexican holiday Dia de los Muertos, Cruz mourns at the grave of his brother, and his parents finally offer their forgiveness.\n\nMeanwhile, in San Quentin, black and Mexican inmates systematically attack and kill several white gang members. Afterward, the Mexicans turn on the blacks and kill several, including Bonafide. The news media reports that seventeen inmates were killed. Paco accuses Miklo of orchestrating Montana's murder in order to start the gang war, and Miklo argues that many Chicano lives were saved as a result. Paco is ashamed of him, and refuses Miklo's request to work together on illegal ventures.\n\nWhen the prison tries to break apart the Mexican gang by transferring several inmates to other prisons, Miklo orders his men to start gang charters in their new prisons to expand their power. Magic Mike reveals the soap mold he made of Bonafide's hair comb, and gives it to Miklo to destroy. The men express their love for Montana, and regret killing him to regain power. Magic Mike vows his life to Miklo as his \"Jefe\" (Chief).\n\nOutside the prison, in 1984, Cruz celebrates finally being free of heroin, and encourages Paco to make peace with Miklo, claiming family is all they have."

    "Braddock: Missing in Action III": "On April 29, 1975, South Vietnamese citizens evacuate their homes and head to the United States Embassy to find a way to leave the city of Saigon before it falls to the communist North Vietnamese army advancing on the city. U.S. embassy personnel and Vietnamese refugees board helicopters on the embassy's rooftop. U.S. Army Colonel James Braddock (Chuck Norris) enters the embassy looking for his Vietnamese wife, Lin Tan Cang Braddock (Miki Kim), an embassy translator. He learns that Lin returned home to get her travel papers.\n\nIn her apartment, Lin packs for her departure with the help of a friend. While assisting Lin, the friend steals a white bracelet, a gift from Braddock. After Lin leaves the apartment, a missile is fired into the building, killing her friend. While Lin walks to the embassy, her purse and travel documents are stolen. Meanwhile, Braddock arrives at Lin's apartment and sees two medics carrying out a body with a white bracelet. Believing the body is Lin, Braddock returns to the embassy.\n\nLater, Lin reaches the embassy's gates, but is unable to enter without her documents. As she pleads with the gate captain, waves of Vietnamese citizens storm the embassy walls, forcing soldiers to lock the gates and close down the embassy. On the rooftop, Col. Braddock sees a man push a woman to steal her seat on a departing helicopter. Braddock throws the man aside, but he pulls a gun and shoots Braddock. Injured, Braddock is placed in the helicopter and departs from Saigon.\n\nTwelve years later in Washington, D.C., Reverend Polanski (Yehuda Efroni) of the Amerasian Children's Mission in Vietnam for orphaned children of American and Asian parentage, approaches Braddock in a bar. He informs Braddock that Lin is alive in Vietnam, and living with Braddock's 12-year-old Amerasian son, Van. Braddock tells him he saw Lin's body and he never had a child with her. Disappointed, Reverend Polanski leaves the bar to return to Vietnam. As Braddock readies to leave the bar as well, two Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agents ask him to come with them. The agents bring Braddock to the office of Dan Littlejohn (Jack Rader). When Littlejohn asks if Reverend Polanski told him about his wife and son, Braddock concludes the story is true, otherwise the CIA would not have asked him about them. Braddock asks if the CIA will free his family, but Littlejohn says no.\n\nA few days later, Braddock flies to Bangkok, Thailand, and meets with Mik (Ron Barker), an expatriate pilot living in Thailand. Mik tells Braddock he has acquired a plane and supplies to allow Braddock to sneak into Vietnam. Before they leave, Littlejohn and CIA agents spot Mik and Braddock in a bar. As one agent leads Mik outside, Braddock fights Littlejohn and the others. Finding Mik in a car, they drive away, chased by Littlejohn's men and Thai law enforcement. After escaping, Braddock and Mik drive to the airfield. They fly toward the Vietnam coast.\n\nBraddock parachutes from the plane into the water below, with a jet-powered speedboat, and escapes capture by the Vietnamese military. Traveling along an inland waterway, Braddock hides his boat and looks for the Amerasian Children's Mission. Meanwhile, Reverend Polanski sits down for dinner with the orphans when he sees Braddock. He shows Braddock the hut where Lin and Van live. Upon entering, Lin hugs Braddock and introduces him to his son, Van. However, Van is distrustful of his father. The three leave, but Van lags behind and is stopped by two patrolmen. Braddock punches both men unconscious, and continues to direct Lin and Van to his boat.\n\nHowever, General Quoc (Aki Aleong) and his men surround the family. Quoc informs Braddock he has heard of his reputation during the Vietnam War of being an MIA and, to seek revenge, shoots Lin in the head, killing her.\n\nAt a military station, Quoc ties Braddock's wrists and hangs him with his toes just touching the floor. Quoc explains the ties connect to a shotgun that will fire at Van if Braddock sets his feet flat on the floor. As hours go by, Braddock does not move. Frustrated, Quoc electrocutes Braddock to make him move. Nevertheless, Braddock stays on his toes. Growing impatient, Quoc forces Braddock's feet to fall flat on the floor, but no shell is fired. The boy is placed in a nearby cell as Quoc continues to electrocute Braddock. Braddock passes out and Quoc orders his guards to take him away.\n\nOn the way to his cell, Braddock awakens and kills the guards. He frees Van and they run to the Amerasian Children's Mission. Quoc follows with reinforcements. At the Mission, Quoc finds Van, and orders him, Reverend Polanski and all the children taken to a prison. Afterward, Braddock returns to his boat for weapons and ammunition to attack the prison.\n\nThe following morning, Braddock sneaks inside and frees Van and the children. He tells them to get into a nearby truck as Van releases Reverend Polanski. As they escape, helicopters fire at them. To lose the helicopters, Braddock drives into the jungle and orders the children out of the truck to hide.\n\nAfter the helicopters leave, Braddock leads Reverend Polanski and the children toward the Thai boarder 90 kilometers away, but the children are unable to complete the trek. Braddock sees an airfield and steals an airplane. As they take off, Quoc and his men arrive and shoot bullets into the plane, puncturing the fuel tank. Braddock radios for assistance from any U.S. Armed Forces stationed nearby. When the fuel runs out, Braddock lands the plane. The group wanders into the jungle and locates a bridge that crosses into Thailand. Braddock tells Reverend Polanski to guide the children after he has killed the soldiers guarding the bridge. Before going, Braddock tells Van he is proud of him and loves him.\n\nOn the Thailand side of the bridge, CIA official Littlejohn tells General Duncan of the U.S. Armed Forces that Braddock and the Amerasian children are on the Vietnamese side. Braddock kills the Vietnamese soldiers, but is injured by a grenade. Seeing his father hurt, Van runs to Braddock as Quoc arrives in a helicopter gunship. As Quoc prepares to fire at Braddock and Van, two U.S. armed helicopters hover over the bridge, aiming their guns at Quoc. Van and Braddock shoot Quoc's helicopter, causing it to crash and killing Quoc. After the crash, Braddock, Van, Reverend Polanski and the Amerasian children cross the bridge and leave Vietnam for good."

    "Brahm\u0101stra Part One: Shiva": "In ancient India, a group of sages in the Himalayas collide with the energy Brahm-shakti, which produces many celestial weapons of great power called astras. The strongest among them, the Brahmastra, has the capacity to destroy the world. The sages use their respective astras to tame the unstable Brahmastra and become the Brahmansh, a secret society to protect the world from the powers of astras.\n\nIn present-day Mumbai, Shiva, a disc jockey, falls in love at first sight with Isha Chatterjee, a London resident who is visiting India for the Durga Puja festival at her grandfather's pandal. Soon, Isha reciprocates and expresses her feelings for Shiva. Shiva tells her that he is an orphan who never knew his father, and that his mother died in a fire when he was a baby (1993).\n\nMeanwhile, in Delhi, scientist and Brahmansh member Mohan Bhargav is attacked by Zor and Raftar for a piece of Brahmastra he safeguards. Mohan fights back using the Vanarastra but is ultimately subdued by Junoon, who works for the mysterious evil named Dev. Under Junoon's possession, who was using Vash Mukut, Mohan reveals that the second piece of Brahmastra is protected by an artist and archaeologist named Anish Shetty in Varanasi. Before he can reveal the current location and guru of the Brahmansh (Ashram), Mohan throws himself out of a balcony.\n\nShiva has a vision of Mohan's encounter with Junoon, as she has a piece of Agneyastra tied to her one hand, and Shiva is somehow connected to it. He and Isha head for Varanasi to warn Anish but are interrupted by Raftar, who now wields Mohan's Vanarastra. Anish defeats him using the Nandi Astra before escaping with Shiva and Isha. While going to Himachal Pradesh, where Ashram is located, they are chased by Junoon and Zor in a truck. Anish gives the second piece of the Brahmastra to Shiva and stays to fight Junoon and Zor, only to be killed. Shiva and Isha are chased by Raftar to Ashram where Shiva kills him using his power of fire after he tried to kill Isha. At Ashram, they learn about other astras and Shiva is forced to join Brahmansh by the guru Raghu for information on his parents. He meets other new recruits Rani, Raveena, Sher and Tenzing, who are all trained by Raghu on how to use their respective astras and Shiva also gains control over fire. As Junoon gets closer to them, Raghu reveals that Shiva is the son of former Brahmansh members, Dev and Amrita. Dev actually awoke the Brahmastra as he was the only person who was able to control multiple astras at once.\n\nDev's wife Amrita (pregnant with Dev's child), who wielded the Jalastra, defeated Dev in a battle on a remote island and both of them seemingly perished in the battle. Amrita's boat was found in the ruins of the battle, brought back from the island, with two broken pieces of the Brahmastra. The pieces of the Brahmastra were given to both Mohan and Anish. The third piece was believed to be missing, with Raghu and Shiva concluding that they both survived the battle. The third piece of the Brahmastra is in Amrita's Mayastra disguised into a conch shell, which Raghu releases by dropping Shiva's blood on the conch. Junoon and her army arrive at Ashram for the Brahmastra and hold everyone hostage. Shiva defeats Junoon while also killing Zor, who wielded Anish's Nandi Astra and releases everyone. But Junoon manages to take the third piece from Isha. She seemingly sacrifices herself to activate the Brahmastra. The destruction begins and Isha is in danger, but Shiva gains control over the Brahmastra with newfound strength stemming from his protectiveness of Isha and reunites with her.\n\nBefore the credits, due to Junoon having activated the Brahmastra, Dev, who was imprisoned as a statue on an unknown island, is released."

    "Brave": "In a prologue, we see Lord Fergus and Lady Elinor in a forested area, celebrating the birthday of their young daughter, Merida. Though Elinor happily plays with Merida, she grows perturbed when Fergus gives the little girl her own bow and set of arrows.\n\nAs Merida tries to hit a target, one of the arrows sails off into the forest nearby. Merida runs off and retrieves it, but soon encounters a glowing blue willo-the-wisp. Going back to her parents, she tells what she saw, and her mother explains that they can lead a person to their destiny.\n\nSuddenly, the mood is broken as an enormous black bear enters the camp grounds. Merida and her mother quickly take leave as Lord Fergus and his men fight against the bear.\n\nTime passes, and we see that Lord Fergus has lost his leg to the bear. In the time that has passed, Lady Elinor has given birth to three mischievous boys (triplets), and Merida is now a teenager. While her mother wants her to be proper, Merida is moreso intent on practicing archery, and journeying off in the forest.\n\nOne evening, a messenger brings word that the 3 neighboring clans have accepted the offer to fight for Merida's hand in marriage. Naturally, the young woman is not at all happy with this situation. Elinor explains to her daughter that the clans must be kept in harmony, or chaos may reign. She relates the story of how the clans were descended from four brothers, but one of them wanted more power than the others, and caused the balance of power to crumble. Even so, this does little to quell Merida's resentment of the betrothal.\n\nThe three clans soon arrive, and Lords MacGuffin, Macintosh, and Dingwall arrive with each of their sons. Per tradition, each of the first-born of the clans will fight in the event that the Princess chooses. This causes Merida to perk up, and she eagerly suggests archery.\n\nWhen it comes to the sport, almost none of the sons are good at the sport, but everyone is shocked when Merida appears before everyone, claiming that since she's a first-born as well, she'll be 'fighting for her own hand.' Elinor demands Merida stop, but she defies her mother, and makes a bulls-eye on each of the targets.\n\nNaturally, Elinor feels angry and humiliated at this, and both mother and daughter have a heated conversation in her room later on. Merida claims she does not want to be like her mother, and in anger, slashes a tapestry depicting the family, slicing a hole between her and her mother in the piece.\n\nUpset by this as well, Elinor loses her temper, and throws Merida's bow in a fireplace nearby. Upset by this, Merida flees the castle. Unseen by Merida, her mother regrets what she has done a few moments later, and manages to retrieve the bow from the fire.\n\nMerida flees to the forest, where she comes across a circle of stones, and several willo-the-wisps. Following them, she finds a small cottage inhabited by an old woman. The old woman claims she is just a wood carver, but Merida soon realizes she's actually a witch, when she notices an enchanted broom, and the woman's crow (which can talk!).\n\nMerida eagerly asks for a spell to change her mother, but the witch refuses, claiming she did a spell once before, and regretted it. However, Merida gets her to reconsider when she agrees to purchase all her wood carvings. The offer is too much to resist, and the witch brews a concoction that produces a small pie. Merida is instructed to give it to her mother, and she eagerly ruses off to do so.\n\nReturning to the castle, King Fergus is doing his best to quell the Lords after the events of the tournament. Merida encounters her mother in the kitchen, and eagerly gives her the pie, but after one bite, Elinor claims she does not feel well.\n\nMerida happily leads her to her chambers, but soon her happiness that her mother will change turns to shock...when her mother turns into a black bear!\n\nKnowing that King Fergus will surely kill Elinor, Merida enlists the aid of her brothers to distract Fergus and the Lords, while she sneaks her mother out of the castle, and back into the forest.\n\nThe two manage to find the witch's hovel, but find it is now empty. A message left for Merida tells that the Witch has gone away until the next Spring, and that the spell will become permanent within 2 sunrises. However, if Merida wants to reverse the effects, she has heed some specific words, in regards to 'mending.' Merida is unsure just what this means, and the two sleep in the woods that evening, before having breakfast in the morning.\n\nMerida manages to catch some fish for her mother, but when her mother demands more, Merida tells her mother she will need to catch them herself. The mother and daughter bond over this method, but when her mother wanders off into the woods, Merida chases after her. However, upon finding her, her mother suddenly attempts to attack Merida, before returning to normal. With less than 24 hours, it seems that if they do not find a way to reverse the spell, Elinor will lose her humanity, and become a bear forever!\n\nAs they wander in the woods, the two come across the willo-the-wisps again, and follow them. They are lead to a high mountain, and the ruins of a great castle. Inside, Merida finds a stone tablet depicting 4 men, with one of them separated from the group. Soon, Merida realizes that she is in the castle in the legend her mother told her about, and soon makes the connection:\n\nThe brother who attempted to seize power from his siblings went to the witch, and her spell turned him into a bear...powerful and stronger than his brothers, but he was unable to change back, and became a rampaging beast, the same one who took Lord Fergus' leg!\n\nSuddenly, the bear emerges from the darkness and attempts to attack Merida. Elinor manages to save her daughter, and the two head back to the circle of stones. However, Merida is now sure what needs to be done. The witch's spell mentioned mending, and Merida feels that if she can mend the tapestry she cut the day before, her mother will be saved."

    "Braveheart": "In 1280, King Edward \"Longshanks\" invades and conquers Scotland following the death of Alexander III of Scotland, who left no heir to the throne. Young William Wallace witnesses Longshanks' treachery, survives the deaths of his father and brother, and is taken abroad on a pilgrimage throughout Europe by his paternal Uncle Argyle, where he is educated. Years later, Longshanks grants his noblemen land and privileges in Scotland, including Prima Nocte. Meanwhile, a grown Wallace returns to Scotland and falls in love with his childhood friend Murron MacClannough, and the two marry in secret. Wallace rescues Murron from being raped by English soldiers, but as she fights off their second attempt, Murron is captured and publicly executed. In retribution, Wallace leads his clan to slaughter the English garrison in his hometown and send the occupying garrison at Lanark back to England.\n\nLongshanks orders his son Prince Edward to stop Wallace by any means necessary. Wallace rebels against the English, and as his legend spreads, hundreds of Scots from the surrounding clans join him. Wallace leads his army to victory at the Battle of Stirling Bridge and then destroys the city of York, killing Longshanks' nephew and sending his severed head to the king. Wallace seeks the assistance of Robert the Bruce, the son of nobleman Robert the Elder and a contender for the Scottish crown. Robert is dominated by his father, who wishes to secure the throne for his son by submitting to the English. Worried by the threat of the rebellion, Longshanks sends his son's wife Isabella of France to try to negotiate with Wallace as a distraction for the landing of another invasion force in Scotland.\n\nAfter meeting him in person, Isabella becomes enamored of Wallace. Warned of the coming invasion by Isabella, Wallace implores the Scottish nobility to take immediate action to counter the threat and take back the country. Leading the English army himself, Longshanks confronts the Scots at Falkirk where noblemen Lochlan and Mornay, having been bribed by Longshanks, betray Wallace, causing the Scots to lose the battle. As Wallace charges toward the departing Longshanks on horseback, he is intercepted by one of the king's lancers, who turns out to be Robert the Bruce, but filled with remorse, Bruce gets Wallace to safety before the English can capture him. Wallace kills Lochlan and Mornay for their betrayal, and wages a guerrilla war against the English for the next seven years, assisted by Isabella, with whom he eventually has an affair. Robert sets up a meeting with Wallace in Edinburgh, but Robert's father has conspired with other nobles to capture and hand over Wallace to the English. Learning of his treachery, Robert disowns his father. Isabella exacts revenge on the now terminally ill Longshanks by telling him that his bloodline will be destroyed upon his death as she is now pregnant with Wallace's child.\n\nIn London, Wallace is brought before an English magistrate, tried for high treason, and condemned to public torture and beheading. Even whilst being hanged, drawn and quartered, Wallace refuses to submit to the king. As cries for mercy come from the watching crowd deeply moved by the Scotsman's valor, the magistrate offers him one final chance, asking him only to utter the word, \"Mercy\", and be granted a quick death. Wallace instead shouts, \"Freedom!\", and the judge orders his death. Moments before being decapitated, Wallace sees a vision of Murron in the crowd, smiling at him.\n\nIn 1314, Robert, now Scotland's king, leads a Scottish army before a ceremonial line of English troops on the fields of Bannockburn, where he is to formally accept English rule. As he begins to ride toward the English, he stops and invokes Wallace's memory, imploring his men to fight with him as they did with Wallace. Robert then leads his army into battle against the stunned English, winning the Scots their freedom."

    "Braven": "Logging company owner and family man Joe Braven (Jason Momoa), lives with his wife Stephanie (Jill Wagner), and their daughter Charlotte (Sasha Rossof). A storm is coming, and Joe's driver Weston is taking a truck full of logs. He asks Weston to stay overnight for the storm to pass, but Weston insists to complete the run as he needs to be back by the next day.\n\nBraven's father Linden (Stephen Lang), who suffers from dementia, gets into a bar room brawl after mistaking a woman for his wife and asking her to come back home with him. This requires Joe to come to his aid and resulting in hospitalization for Linden (after he is hit in the head with a beer mug). Sheriff Cal Osser (Steve O'Connell) is very understanding but tells Joe that he will have to arrest Linden if this happens again. The doctor tells Joe that Linden's mental condition is getting worse and that he needs full time supervision, but Joe refuses to consider putting Linden at an old age home.\n\nJoe is distraught at the idea that he has to let Linden go as he is the strongest person he knows. On Stephanie's suggestion Joe and Charlotte spend some time together at the family's secluded mountain cabin with Linden.\n\nWhile transporting logs by truck, Joe's co-worker, a driver named Weston (Brendan Fletcher) is asked by Hallett (Zahn McClarnon), a drug trafficker, to recruit other drivers into Hallett's criminal activities, but Weston refuses. Hallett loads 2 tree logs full of cocaine bags into Weston's truck. Hallett sits in the driver's cabin with Weston. As Weston gets back on the road, the storm hits in full force and Weston loses control of his truck, causing a crash that displaces all the logs and cocaine from the vehicle. Hallett cracks up his 2 logs and transfers all the cocaine pallets into a large bag.\n\nWeston and Hallett resolve go to Joe's mountain cabin to store the cocaine there in Joe's garage. On their way back, Weston and Hallett are picked up by a police patrol car and taken to the nearest motel. Hallett relays the news of the crash to his employer, drug lord Kassen (Garret Dillahunt). Kassen is livid as he specifically told Hallett to bring the load over in multiple runs, but Hallett ignored his instructions and decided to bring the entire load in a single run.\n\nAfter Joe, Linden and Charlotte arrive at the cabin, the next morning. Charlotte was hiding in the family car as Joe and Linden were going to the cabin some alone time together and Joe wanted Charlotte to stay back with Stephanie. When they reach the cabin, Joe talks to Linden about having more supervision for Linden, but Linden is offended by the idea and believes that Joe wants to put him at an old age home. Meanwhile Joe discovers the cocaine in his garage. Linden walks into the garage and they both realize that the stuff stored is drugs and that someone is coming their way to pick it up. Charlotte comes out of the car and reveals herself to Joe. Kassen and his men pick up Hallett and Weston from the motel and head to Joe's cabin.\n\nJoe, Linden and Charlotte try to drive out, but the cabin has a single approach road, which is covered by Kassen's men. Joe senses danger with the abnormal movement of wildlife on the road and backs up to the cabin.\n\nThe cabin is then surrounded by Kassen's mercenaries. Joe tries to negotiate with Kassen by giving him half the drugs, and the other half when he clears the property and meets Joe in town in half an hour. When Weston tries to act as a go-between, Kassen kills him. Kassen sends Joe back into the cabin to get the remaining half of the drugs. Joe tries to fire up the short-wave radio, but the reception is very patchy and not clear. Unable to call for help because of lack of cellular signals at the cabin, Joe, armed with a bow and arrow, and Linden with a gun, kill some of the mercenaries during the ensuing standoff.\n\nNeeding higher ground in order to access a cellular network, Joe drives out of the house on a Quad bike with the original cocaine bag, and Charlotte, hidden under a blanket. Joe drops off Charlotte and instructs her climb to the mountain.\n\nMeanwhile, at home, Stephanie finds a note from Charlotte that she left with Joe and starts to drive towards the cabin. On top of the mountain, Charlotte calls Stephanie when her cell phone receives proper reception and tells her that unknown men are shooting at them at the cabin. Circling back, Joe dispatches more of Kassen's men. Kassen finds the bag, but it is empty. Discovering where Joe sent Charlotte, Kassen sends one of the mercenaries, Ridley (Glenn Ennis), to find her, though when Kassen enters the cabin, he is stabbed twice by Linden, who then retreats, and is later wounded by another mercenary, Essington (Teach Grant).\n\nJust before Ridley catches up to Charlotte, a bow-wielding Stephanie arrives, and shoots Ridley with an arrow. A hand-to-hand fight ensures, during which she stabs Ridley before fleeing.\n\nMeanwhile, Joe returns to the cabin, where he dispatches Clay (Fraser Aitcheson) and kills Essington. Charlotte is picked up by the sheriff as Ridley continues to pursue Stephanie. Kassen takes Linden hostage. Joe pleads for his life, but Kassen fatally stabs him. Kassen is then shot by the sheriff, and escapes the cabin, later retrieving the lost cocaine. Joe then chases after him, and after a knife fight in which Kassen bests Joe and taunts him about Linden's death, Joe tackles Kassen off a cliff, killing him. Joe tearfully reconciles with his family."

    "Brawl in Cell Block 99": "Former boxer and drug mule Bradley Thomas is laid off from his job at an auto-repair shop. As he arrives home, he sees his wife, Lauren, sitting in her car talking to someone on her cellphone. Bradley approaches her and sees a love bite on her neck. Lauren confesses that she has been seeing somebody else. Bradley orders her inside the house before he violently dismantles her car with his bare hands. When calm, he enters the house to discuss with Lauren their failing relationship. Bradley decides to forgive Lauren and returns to work as a drug mule.\n\nEighteen months later, Bradley and a now pregnant Lauren have relocated to a larger, more expensive home. Bradley's boss, Gil, introduces him to Eleazar, a new business associate, and gives him a new task. Bradley is to sail off the coast with two of Eleazar's men to pick up a package of crystal meth. Bradley does not trust the larger of the two men, Roman, but accepts the job when Gil offers him three months paternity leave. As they arrive at the pier, Bradley senses they are walking into a police trap and dumps his bag into the water. Bradley instructs the other two men to do the same, but they ignore his order and confront the police in a firefight, wounding three officers. After pausing and considering turning away, Bradley instead shoots both Eleazar's men in order to assist the police. The third drug trafficker dies in the shootout. Bradley is taken into custody and sentenced to seven years in a medium-security prison.\n\nDuring the night, Lauren is kidnapped by men under orders of Eleazar. On the second day of his incarceration, Bradley is visited by the Placid Man, who informs Bradley that he works for Eleazar. He tells Bradley that, unless Bradley assassinates an inmate named Christopher Bridge, located in Redleaf Correctional Facility, a separate maximum-security prison, the limbs of his unborn child will be surgically removed by an abortionist and sent to him. Bradley reluctantly accepts.\n\nBradley picks a fight with multiple guards, until he is overpowered and transferred to Redleaf. There, he meets unforgiving Warden Tuggs. Bradley is put into a horrible cell, where the toilet is clogged with feces. Eventually, he is able to go outside for yard time. When a fellow inmate informs him that Christopher Bridge is not located in this section of the prison but in another section known as cell block 99, Bradley fights some other inmates and consequently is thrown into cell block 99.\n\nWarden Tuggs explains that cell block 99 is where he devises special punishments for society's most despised criminals. Bradley is forced to wear a stun belt that gives him electric shocks at a push of a button, as a punishment for the fight. His cell in block 99 is lined with broken glass and only contains a crude squat toilet hole. Bradley speaks to a man in an adjacent cell, who informs him that Christopher Bridge does not exist at all. During the night, a young brutal guard named Wilson escorts Bradley to another, larger cell in block 99, where Eleazar, Roman, and two other gangsters are located. The gang torture Bradley with the electric belt, and taunt him by threatening to call the abortionist. He is beaten and shocked so badly that he needs to be dragged back to the cell unconscious.\n\nBradley devises a plan and tears the lining out of his shoes: he places the rubber between his body and the belt to prevent the shocks. This enables him to ambush Wilson and another guard; resulting in him killing Wilson. Bradley locks the second guard inside a cell. Bradley confronts Eleazar, and brutally kills all three henchmen in hand-to-hand combat. During the brawl, Eleazar calls the Placid Man and instructs him to activate the abortionist. Bradley first tortures Eleazar by breaking his leg, then calls the Placid Man to negotiate for Lauren's freedom. It is agreed that the Placid Man will deliver Lauren to Gil's house. Bradley drags Eleazar into his own cell, across the broken glass, to await confirmation of Lauren's freedom. Warden Tuggs and his men arrive at block 99, but Bradley threatens to kill his two hostages. Bradley states he is waiting for a phone call, and promises that he will surrender peacefully, exactly one minute after the call ends.\n\nThe Placid Man and the abortionist follow Eleazar's instructions and drive Lauren unharmed to Gil's house. As they drive away, Gil retrieves a hidden assault rifle and kills the Placid Man. Lauren then takes the rifle and shoots the abortionist. Gil phones Bradley to inform him that his family is finally safe. Bradley speaks to Lauren for the last time, and shares a few words with their unborn child.\n\nBradley destroys the cell phone, then reminds Warden Tuggs that he still has 60 seconds of freedom remaining. Bradley shoves Eleazar's face into the squat hole and stomps several times on his neck, decapitating Eleazar and leaving the head at the bottom of the toilet. Warden Tuggs and his men finally enter the cell. Warden Tuggs orders Bradley to turn around with his hands behind his head. Bradley says \"78 days\" and turns around to face Warden Tuggs and his guards. Bradley gives one last look at Tuggs, who then shoots Bradley twice, once in the chest and once in the head. The screen cuts to black on the third gunshot and Bradley's body hitting the floor is heard."

    "Breaking In": "The film opens with a man named Isaac (Damien Leake) going for a job from the city to a suburban neighborhood. He gets hit by a pick-up truck on the way. The driver steps out of the car and walks over to Isaac and stomps his head in.\n\nSometime later, Isaac's estranged daughter Shaun Russell (Gabrielle Union) is driving to Isaac's old home with her kids Jasmine (Ajiona Alexus) and Glover (Seth Carr) in order to settle the estate and sell the house. Upon arriving to the house, Glover finds security cameras in the basement, along with the remote that controls everything in the house.\n\nHours later, as Shaun is ordering pizza, four criminals - Peter (Mark Furze), Sam (Levi Meaden), Duncan (Richard Cabral), and leader Eddie (Billy Burke) - break into the house and take Jasmine and Glover hostage. Peter attacks Shaun outside, but she fights him off and stabs him with a broken wine glass. When she tries to get into the house, she finds Eddie standing over the kids menacingly. Peter chases after Shaun into the woods with a crowbar. She fights him and manages to knock him unconscious when he hits his head on a rock. She leaves him bound and gagged.\n\nShaun runs back to the house to speak to Eddie on the intercom. He says they only came for the safe in the house containing $4 million. They have 90 minutes before the security company calls the police and they want to find the money immediately. Duncan is bloodthirsty and thinks they should kill everyone since they saw their faces, but Eddie is more relaxed about it.\n\nAs Shaun tries to find a way inside the house, Maggie (Christa Miller), the real estate agent, comes to the house with paperwork for Shaun. She is greeted at the door by Eddie, who says that Shaun went into town for groceries. When Maggie notices Shaun's car is still there, as well as her purse, she becomes suspicious and decides to leave. Before she can get to her car, Duncan attacks her and slits her throat, which Shaun sees. Eddie and Sam chastise Duncan for this.\n\nShaun manages to get her hands on firecrackers as she sneaks around the house to find a way in. She sets off the firecrackers and breaks the security lights. The villains try to find her, but Shaun manages to find a way in and get to the kids. She gets to Jasmine and tells her what to do so she and Glover can stay safe.\n\nWith time running out, Shaun has to get out as the villains go back to the room with the kids. Jasmine tells Eddie she knows where the safe is. She leads them to a room where she pulls back a tile on the wall and the safe is revealed hidden by the closet. However, only Peter knows how to open the safe.\n\nThe villains go outside as Shaun comes back with Peter and a knife held at his throat. Knowing that they need him, she demands that they let the kids come out so they can leave together and they can take the money. Eddie responds by shooting Peter dead and forcing Shaun to run back into the woods. Eddie takes a flash drive off a necklace that Peter was wearing so that they can open the safe. They then tie the kids up as Duncan starts to dump kerosene everywhere so they can light the place on fire.\n\nShaun makes another attempt to save the kids by coming from the roof, but she is found by Duncan and Sam. After a tense moment, Shaun takes the rope she was holding and swings down to the ground after pushing Sam off the roof, where he dies after his head hits the ground. Meanwhile, Jasmine cuts herself and Glover loose. Eddie finds them, but Jasmine manages to stab him before Glover takes his gun. He fires at Eddie and misses. Shaun takes Sam's keys as the kids run out of the house. They make it to Sam's truck as Duncan walks up from behind. Shaun goes in reverse and runs Duncan over, but Eddie shoots at the truck and causes them to crash.\n\nShaun and the kids run back to the house and lock themselves in. Soon, Shaun's husband Justin (Jason George) arrives and is attacked by Eddie. He makes his way back in the house and finds Shaun holding a lighter over the money bag after she poured kerosene on it. She knows that if Eddie kills her, she will just drop the lighter and he will lose what he came for. Eddie takes out the cartridge from the gun, and Shaun lets him take the money. However, Duncan returns and stabs Eddie to death. He goes after Shaun and threatens to rape her and Jasmine. Jasmine arrives to help her mom, but Duncan overpowers her. Shaun goes for Eddie's gun, but Duncan kicks it away. Before he can do anything else, Shaun swipes his knife and stabs him dead.\n\nThe film ends as Shaun goes outside to hold Justin and their kids close as the police arrive."

    "Bright": "This film is set in an alternate reality of the city of Los Angeles, where humans co-exist with orcs, elves, and fairies. Officer Daryl Ward (Will Smith) is out on the streets with his partner, Nick Jakoby (Joel Edgerton), who is the world's first orc cop. Jakoby is grabbing a burrito when an orc gangster emerges from a shop and blasts Ward with a shotgun.\n\nSome time later, Ward is ready to go back to the force. He is struggling to keep his house that he shares with his wife Sherri (Dawn Olivieri) and daughter Sophia (Scarlet Spencer). Sophia hates that her dad is a cop because she worries he'll get killed. They see a video from Joe Rogan interviewing an orc as they discuss Jakoby being on the force. The other orcs hate Jakoby as they consider him a traitor. Ward dislikes having him as a partner because he blames Jakoby for him getting shot. Sherri then makes him go outside to deal with a fairy that's attacking the bird feeder. Ward takes a broom and whacks the fairy to death.\n\nWard and Jakoby ride together, with Ward openly blaming Jakoby for the shooting incident. After driving through the wealthy Elftown neighborhood, they arrive at work, where a few rotten cops - Pollard (Ike Barinholtz), Hicks (Matt Gerald), and Brown (Joseph Piccuirro) - mock Jakoby when he's not around. When Ward is assigned to be on patrol with Jakoby for the day, he protests to Sergeant Ching (Margaret Cho), but she doesn't care for his complaints.\n\nWard and Jakoby head downtown to handle a disturbance, meeting with Sheriff Rodriguez (Jay Hernandez). A crazy man named Serling (Chris Browning) is waving a sword around and yelling nonsense. With the officers drawing their weapons, Serling surrenders and is taken into custody. On the ride back to the precinct, Serling pukes in the back of the car before starting to speak Orkish to Jakoby, saying he has a message from an organization called the Shield of Light, telling him to \"remember the old ways\", and how a prophecy has chosen him, and that Ward is blessed.\n\nWard is later approached by Captain Perez (Andrea Navedo), along with two men - Yamahara (Kenneth Choi) and Arkashian (Bobby Naderi) - who order Ward to record Jakoby admitting that he let Ward's shooter get away.\n\nSerling is interrogated by an elf FBI agent, Kandomere (Edgar Ramirez), and his partner Montehugh (Happy Anderson). The agents ask Serling what he knows about two elf sisters - Leilah (Noomi Rapace) and Tikka (Lucy Fry). Serling knows that Leilah is a dark elf, part of the Inferni clan that wants to resurrect the Dark Lord, an evil entity that was defeated 2,000 years earlier by the Nine Armies. Leilah and her minions want to bring him back to unleash darkness upon the world with the use of three magic wands. Leilah is a \"Bright\", meaning she can wield a wand without it destroying her. Montehugh says they need to find Tikka in order to set a trap for Leilah.\n\nOn the night patrol, Ward tries to get Jakoby to confess to the incident, when they are alerted to something going on at a house on Abrams Street. They arrive and are shot at by an unseen assailant. After a shootout, the officers kill the assailant. They head inside the house and find dead bodies, including a few that look like they were burnt alive. The officers find Tikka, who is in possession of the wand.\n\nWard calls in Ching and the other cops in regards to the wand. They want the wand for themselves, and they order Ward to go along with it and kill Jakoby, or he dies as well. Ward goes outside to do the job, but first he presses Jakoby at gunpoint on what really happened when he got shot. Jakoby admits he did let the shooter get away, but it was because he lost him in a crowd. He thought he cornered the guy in an alley, but it was just a young orc spray-painting the side of a building. Knowing that the human officers would kill the kid on the spot, Jakoby let him get away on a fire escape. Moments later, Ching and the officers step outside. Ward spins around quickly and shoots them all dead, but Pollard is the only one hanging on for his life. Jakoby attempts to arrest Ward until they are approached by a gang led by wheelchair-bound Poison (Enrique Murciano), who knows about the wand and wants it for himself so that he can walk again. Ward and Jakoby take Tikka and head into their van as the gangsters start attacking.\n\nThe officers drive away as the gangsters pursue them. The gangsters shoot at them, but Ward and Jakoby are able to shake most of them off. They find a place to hide briefly until more gangsters come after them. One of them finds the wand and tries to grab it, but it causes him to explode and kill those around him.\n\nLeilah and her minions arrive at the Abrams house and find Pollard dying before Leilah finishes the job. She then finds another Inferni elf, Larika (Nadia Grey), who is stuck to the walls. She tells Leilah that Tikka got away with the wand, and she slashes Larika's throat. The elves then come across a family that they kill for more information on the wand's whereabouts. Kandomere and Montehugh later come upon the crime scene at the Abrams house, and Kandomere knows Leilah has lost the wand, making her vulnerable.\n\nWard, Jakoby, and Tikka walk through a sleazy orc/human strip club. Poison and his gang find them and once again threaten them for the wand, but Leilah and her minions show up and slaughter Poison and his gang. Another shootout happens, forcing the trio to run again. They run into a nearby convenience store where they find a place to hide. While tending to their wounds in a bathroom, Ward and Jakoby discuss their relationship. Although Ward doesn't think of them as friends, he does tell Jakoby that he shouldn't want to be like him, despite Jakoby previously stating he wishes he were because he sees Ward as fearless.\n\nRodriguez shows up to the store after hearing about Ward killing the officers. He orders Ward to cuff Jakoby since everyone suspects him anyway, and Jakoby willingly relents. Rodriguez is then shot dead as the elves drive up and crash through the store, shooting at the cops. The trio fight back, shooting at the elves before getting away.\n\nThe trio are then found by a group of orc gangsters belonging to the Fogteeth clan. After Ward mocks them, they get beaten and dragged to a church that serves as their lair. The orcs bring them to their leader, Dorghu (Brad William Henke). He wants the wand as well, and he mocks Jakoby for being unblooded (accepted by the other orcs as one of their own). After the cops refuse to give up the wand, Dorghu orders them to be executed. The guards drag Ward and Jakoby to a pit, and Dorghu orders his son Mikey (Brandon Larracuente) to execute Jakoby. However, Mikey can't bring himself to do so, because he is the young orc that Jakoby let get away. Dorghu allows Mikey to go home, and Dorghu shoots Jakoby, letting his body fall into the pit. Tikka then pulls out the wand and uses it to resurrect Jakoby and raise his body up. The other orcs are astonished and kneel before Jakoby, believing him to be the one the prophecy spoke of. The three then leave.\n\nTikka then speaks English for the first time, now that she knows she can trust Ward and Jakoby. She explains that she took the wand because she knew Leilah wanted to bring back the Dark Lord, and she had sent Larika to kill her, but Tikka took the wand herself. The use of the wand took a toll on her, and it's starting to kill her. She tells them that the Shield of Light can help them if they take her to a pool back at the Abrams house.\n\nWard and Jakoby bring Leilah back to the house. Leilah and the other dark elves show up and battle the cops. Ward and Jakoby manage to kill the elves, and Jakoby appears to shoot Leilah dead. They then take Tikka to the pool beneath a tree, but Leilah emerges, still alive. When she tries to get the wand, Ward grabs it himself. It starts to glow, and he doesn't explode, meaning he is a Bright. Tikka tells him a war word to cast a spell, which Ward repeats, causing the wand to blast Leilah to smithereens. Outside, authorities arrive just as they witness the explosion. Ward and Jakoby look for Tikka, but she's gone.\n\nThe officers are in the hospital and are approached by Kandomere and Montehugh. Although Jakoby tries to explain everything that happened, Ward denies that there was ever a wand, and that gangsters killed the corrupt officers.\n\nIn the final scene, Ward and Jakoby are commemorated for their heroism. Pollard, Brown, Hicks, and Ching are also honored alongside Rodriguez, with Ward expressing his hatred for that fact. Jakoby tells him to let it go, since at least they know the truth. Sherri and Sophia are there to support Ward, while he and Jakoby notice Tikka walking among the crowd, smiling at them."

    "Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia": "A pregnant woman is shown caressing her stomach as she lies near a pond of swans. Two men inform tell her that her father, a powerful Mexican landowner known only as \"El Jefe,\" expects to see her. El Jefe asks his daughter to her who the father of her child is. It isn't until his bodyguards break her arm, that she finally answers, \"Alfredo Garc\u00eda.\" El Jefe then offers $1 million to whoever brings him the head of Alfredo Garc\u00eda.\n\nThe search for Garc\u00eda progresses as different people go across several Mexican places asking for anyone who has seen him. In Mexico City, a pair of business suit-clad, dispassionate hit men, Sappensly and Quill, enter a saloon and encounter Bennie, a retired U.S. Army officer who makes a meager living as a piano player and bar manager. The men ask about Garc\u00eda, believing they will have more luck getting answers out of a fellow American. Bennie plays dumb, saying the name is familiar but he doesn't know who Garc\u00eda is.\n\nIt turns out that everyone in the bar knows who Garc\u00eda is they simply don't know where he is. Bennie goes to meet his girlfriend, Elita, who is a prostitute, at a big hotel. Elita admits to having been with Garc\u00eda, who had professed his love for her, something Bennie refuses to do. Elita informs him that Garc\u00eda died in a drunk-driving accident the previous week.\n\nExcited by the possibility of making money by simply digging up the body, Bennie goes to Sappensly and Quill in the hotel room of the man who hired them, El Jefe's business associate Max, and makes a deal for $10,000 for Garcia's head, plus a $200 advance for expenses. Bennie convinces Elita to go on a road trip with him to visit Garc\u00eda's grave, claiming that he only wants proof that Garcia is in fact dead and no longer a threat to their relationship.\n\nEn route, Bennie proposes, promising that their future will soon change, and she can retire from her cleaning job. Elita warns Bennie against trying to upset their status quo. While having a picnic, Bennie and Elita are accosted by two bikers, who pull guns and decide to rape Elita. Bennie seems unsure how to react. Elita agrees to have sex with the bikers if they spare Bennie's life, then goes off with one of them. He rips off her shirt, lets her slap him twice, slaps her back, then walks away. Bennie knocks the second biker unconscious, takes his gun and finds Elita about to make love with the first biker. Bennie shoots him dead and kills the second biker as well.\n\nBennie confesses to Elita his plan to decapitate Garc\u00eda's corpse and sell the head for money. A disgusted Elita, still shaken from what has just happened, begs Bennie to give up this quest and return to Mexico City, where they can be married and live a modest life of relative peace. Bennie again refuses, although he agrees to marry Elita in the church of the town where Garc\u00eda is buried. They find Garcia's grave, but when he opens the coffin, Bennie is struck from behind with his shovel by an unseen assailant. He wakes up to find himself half-buried in the grave with Elita, who is dead. Garc\u00eda's corpse is then revealed to have been decapitated.\n\nBennie learns from villagers that his assailants are driving a station wagon. He catches up with the men after they blow out a tire. Bennie shoots them, searches their car, and claims Garc\u00eda's head. Stopping at a roadside restaurant, he packs the sack containing the head with ice to preserve it for the journey home. Bennie begins addressing the head as if Garc\u00eda were still alive, first blaming Alfredo for Elita's death and then conceding that both of them probably loved her equally.\n\nBennie is ambushed by members of Garc\u00eda's family. They re-claim the head and are about to kill Bennie when they are interrupted by the arrival of Sappensly and Quill. The hit men pretend to ask for directions. Quill produces a sub-machine gun and murders most of the family, but is fatally shot by one of them. As Sappensly sorrowfully looks at Quill's corpse, Bennie asks: \"Do I get paid?\" Sappensly turns to shoot, but Bennie kills him. Bennie returns to Mexico City, \"arguing\" with Garc\u00eda's head all the while.\n\nAt his apartment, Bennie gives Garc\u00eda's head a shower and then brings it to Max's hotel room. Feigning willingness to surrender the head for his $10,000, Bennie reveals he is no longer motivated by money; he says Alfredo was a friend of his and demands to know why Max and the others want his head so badly. He also blames Elita's death on the bounty and intends to kill everyone involved. Several men pull guns, but Bennie manages to evade fire and kill them all. He takes a business card from the desk with El Jefe's address on it.\n\nAfter finishing the baptism for his new grandchild, El Jefe greets Bennie as a hero and gives him a briefcase containing the promised million-dollar bounty. Bennie calmly relates how many people died for Garc\u00eda's head, including his beloved. El Jefe responds apathetically, telling Bennie to take his money and throw the head to the pigs on the way out. Infuriated that the object responsible for Elita's death is viewed as nothing more than garbage, Bennie guns down all of El Jefe's bodyguards.\n\nEl Jefe's daughter enters with her newborn son, causing Bennie to hesitate shooting El Jefe. She tersely urges Bennie to kill her father. Bennie obliges, taking along Garcia's head. Bennie drives away, only to be killed by El Jefe's men, their machine guns tearing him to pieces."

    "Britannic": "The film opens with several real life shots of the Britannic being launched and fitted out in Belfast, as well as several shots of World War I taking place.\n\nOn November 12th, 1916, at Southampton Docks, a boat approaches the sister ship of the Titanic, His Majesty's Hospital Ship Britannic. On board the small boat are the wife of the British Ambassador of Greece, Lady Lewis (Jacqueline Bisset), her two children, William and Sarah (Archie Davies and Eleanor Oakley) and her governess, Vera Campbell (Amanda Ryan). The Britannic's First Officer, Townsend (Ben Daniels) tells the passengers of the boat that Britannic is \"their home away from home\", and because of the modifications made to her after the sinking of Titanic, she is \"unsinkable\".\n\nMeanwhile, on the dockside, a car pulls up near an old warehouse. Out of the car steps the Britannic's Chaplain. Just he steps out of the car, however, he is attacked by two German men and killed. Out of the shadows steps another German man (Edward Atterton), who climbs into the car and talks to the driver, who is also German.\n\nOn the Britannic, people are now boarding, and the ship's captain, Charles Barrett (John Rhys-Davies) is talking to Townsend about how he didn't expect to be in charge of \"a cruise ship decked out like a floating nursery\". Meanwhile, the Lewis family and Vera Campbell have just boarded when Campbell suddenly faints.\n\nShe is taken to the ship's doctor, Doctor Baker (Bruce Payne), and when he asks her if she has sailed before, she confirms that she has. When Campbell leaves Doctor Baker's office, she goes to the bridge and asks to speak to Captain Barrett alone. He tells her that whatever she has to say can be said in front of Townsend, so she hands him an envelope marked \"Top Secret\". He is surprised to hear that she is not actually Lady Lewis' governess: she is working undercover for the Military. She tells him that the Military believes that there is a spy on board the ship, but Captain Barrett believes that that is ridiculous. Campbell tells him that the Germans believe that the ship is carrying munitions, so he shouts out that this is not true, apart from a few small arms to secure the ship. He then tells her that if she has not found her spy by the time that the ship has arrived at Naples to refuel, he will contact the Admiralty and ask for her to be put ashore.\n\nCampbell leaves the bridge to find the two children, William and Sarah, playing with a fire hose. She tells them that she is looking for pirates, and that they can help her look for them. As they run around looking for them, William bumps into the same German man that climbed into the car on the dock (who speaks perfect English). He tells them that he is the Chaplain, Reynolds. As he agrees to help the children look for pirates some time, the ship leaves the harbour, and Campbell becomes worried.\n\nIn her cabin, Lady Lewis is being examined by Doctor Baker, as she had injured herself sometime before. She also tells Baker that it is rather strange that Campbell has been assigned as her governess, as she is not her usual one. Later, as Britannic begins her voyage, the crew have a briefing with the medical staff, and afterwards, Reynolds heads down to the boiler rooms, where he learns that the bulkhead doors are opened twice every day for about fifteen minutes.\n\nOne of the stokers, Evans (Alex Ferns) talks to Reynolds, saying that his son is very ill, and getting worse every day.\n\nIn this movie appears Wolf Kahler who will later play Ludendorff, chemist and Fritz Shimon Haber's close friend in Haber (2008)."

    "Broken Arrow": "Major Vic \"Deak\" Deakins (John Travolta) and Captain Riley Hale (Christian Slater) are pilots in the United States Air Force, stationed in the southwest United States. After a sparring match between the two where Deak also coaches Hale on how to dodge a blow from an opponent, the pilots are assigned to a top secret exercise on a B-3 Stealth Bomber (a fictional advanced version of the actual B-2 Spirit stealth bomber) with two B-83 nuclear bombs on board. Deakins and Hale take off from Whiteman Air Force Base carrying the two live nuclear weapons on an evening exercise over Utah.\n\nAfter successfully evading Air Force radar during the exercise, Deakins begins a friendly conversation to distract and shoot Hale. A struggle ensues, ending when Deakins ejects Hale. He then releases the bombs from the plane without detonating them. When the Air Force base regains radar contact with the aircraft, Deakins reports, \"Hale's lost it. I'm punching out\", and ejects, leaving the plane to crash into a mountainside over the Utah canyons.\n\nA search and rescue team is sent to recover the warheads. They do not find the warheads in the plane's payload bay wreckage and report a \"Broken Arrow\", a situation wherein nuclear weapons are missing. The team later locates the warheads in a canyon but are killed while recovering them by mercenaries, including Sgt. Kelly (Howie Long), a corrupt member of the team. Deakins arrives moments later and plots his next move with Pritchett (Bob Gunton), the operation's financier.\n\nMeanwhile, Hale survives the ejection and is found by Park Ranger Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis) whom, after a brief stand-off, he convinces to help him track down Deakins and foil his plot. After recovering the weapons from a hijacked Humvee and escaping to a nearby copper mine, Hale attempts to disable them using a safety feature which would render them unusable by intentionally entering the arming code incorrectly. Deakins, however, had anticipated this scenario, and Hale inadvertently arms the warhead.\n\nFinding himself unable to disarm the warhead, Hale decides to place the unarmed weapon deep in the abandoned mine to prevent them from being used elsewhere. Deakins arrives and secures the unarmed warhead, leaving Hale and Terry to die in the upcoming explosion. A helicopter chases Deakins, as the mercenaries proceed with their mission to blackmail the government with the threat of detonating the warhead in a civilian area. Pritchett berates him for allowing the helicopter to give chase, and Deakins, fed up with his complaining, kills Pritchett by crushing his throat with a flashlight. Hale and Terry escape from the mine via an underground river just before the bomb detonates. The bomb's EMP disables and subsequently destroys the NEST Team sent in to recover the warheads when their helicopter crashes and explodes. Terry and Hale track Deakins to a motorboat to be used for transporting the remaining warhead. While trying to steal the boat, Terry is forced to hide on board while Deakins moves the warhead. Military forces find Hale and arrest him, believing Deak's last transmission that Hale had lost his mind on the bomber. Hale is able to convince them otherwise.\n\nHale deduces that Deakins intends to move the warhead on board a train and sets off in a helicopter to find the train and hunt down the remaining mercenaries. Deak had left an ID tag from a Salt Lake City hospital on the boat he'd used to escape. Believing that Deak will try to hide the bomb in the radiology department of the hospital, task forces are sent to Salt Lake City to intercept Deak if he arrives there. Hale thinks that Deak is trying a classic \"rope-a-dope\"; planting the Salt Lake ID to send the pursuit in the wrong direction. Hale suggests that since they have Salt Lake secured, they should check out Denver to the east. Hale's hunch is right and the pursuit finds Deak's train heading east.\n\nAboard the train, Hale finds Terry, whom Deakins has tried, unsuccessfully, to threaten into arming the weapon. A gunfight ensues in which the helicopter that Hale was on with Colonel Wilkins (Delroy Lindo) is destroyed, and Wilkins and most of Deakins' mercenaries are killed. With his own helicopter sabotaged by Hale and his plan falling apart, Deakins decides to detonate the nuke early. Kelly, realizing they will have no chance to get away in time, holds Deakins at gunpoint and demands he disarm the weapon. As the train passes over a viaduct, Hale leaps into the boxcar and kicks Kelly out to his death below. Terry detaches the rear section of the train (with the bomb) from the front, but soon gets into a shootout with the engineer, resulting in the engineer falling on the train brakes and causing the train to stop. However, the detached boxcars continue to coast at high speed. Deakins, still in possession of a remote that can either disarm or detonate the bomb instantly, forces Hale to drop his gun and challenges him to a hand-to-hand fight. Hale uses his greater speed to match Deakins' strength, ultimately winning their rematch from the night before. Hale leaps out of the train at the last second with the weapon's remote control and disarms it. As he does so, the detached boxcars slam into the halted front half of the train. The impact from the collision propels the disarmed warhead into Deakins' chest, and the entire train derails, exploding in a fireball, incinerating Deakins.\n\nHale survives and finds a 20-dollar bill fluttering on a twig in the debris - the same 20-dollar bill Deakins had won from him earlier during their boxing practice - plus the nuclear warhead, damaged but intact. He then finds Terry and they formally introduce themselves to each other amidst the wreckage."

    "Bronson": "The film begins with scenes from Peterson's delinquent early life which he narrates with self-deprecating humor. Initially he addresses the camera dressed in prison garb; other times, he tells his tale in a vaudeville-style theatre with a live audience. The film's story unfolds as a surreal narrative of connected vignettes punctuated by vaudeville interludes.\n\nHe recounts episodes of crime and violence leading to his first prison sentence of seven years. At sentencing his mother hopes he will be out in four but his violence in prison extends his sentence beyond seven years. He is sent to a psychiatric hospital where he continues to rebel and is administered drugs which he claims make him physically weak. His first escape attempt is to walk sluggishly toward the exit, where he is waved back to a chair by a staffer. He decides to escape by earning a transfer back to prison and attempts to strangle a detainee that revealed himself to be a pedophile, but is apprehended before killing the man. He comments to the audience that despite all his prison time and solitary confinement, he has never killed anyone.\n\nIn the vaudeville theatre he shows film footage of a rooftop protest during which he claims to have caused \"tens of millions of pounds' damage\". He credits this destruction with the government's decision to declare him \"sane\" and have him released. After a brief reunion with his parents he sets off to see his flamboyant Uncle Jack. He is welcomed and reintroduced to an old prison mate who promises to set him up as a bare-knuckle boxer and gives him the name Charles Bronson, after the American actor.\n\nBronson enjoys the violence and showmanship of bare-knuckle boxing. Not content with his meagre winnings, he ups the stakes by fighting two opponents at once and even fights a dog. He proposes to a woman and steals a thousand-pound ring in the hope that she will marry him. She declines and after sixty-nine days of freedom Bronson is sent back to jail.\n\nHe takes the prison librarian hostage and waits for reinforcements to arrive, alternately screaming at his hostage and peaceably enquiring after his family. When other guards arrive, he strips naked and forces the librarian to assist in applying his \"body armor\" of petroleum jelly, to make him harder to grab in the imminent brawl. After being restrained, he is warned by the prison governor that he will die inside if his behavior does not improve. Encouraged by a prison art teacher who notices something special in his drawings, he becomes a model prisoner for a while, channeling his confusion and pain into vivid imagery of birds and grotesque creatures. When told the art studio will be closing, Bronson attacks the teacher and holds him hostage.\n\nWhile prison officials wait outside, he demands music be played. He paints his naked body black and ties the teacher to a post. He paints a moustache onto the teacher's face, forces an apple into his mouth and removes his hat and glasses to put on the teacher's head. After this human still-life has been arranged to his satisfaction, he accepts his fate, calling for the prison guards to burst in for yet another brawl, for which he will be sent back to solitary confinement."

    "Brother 2": "In this sequel to Brat (The Brother), this film opens with Danila Bagrov (Sergei Bodrov Jr.) being interviewed on television with two friends from the army. All three now live in Moscow, where Ilya Setevoy (Kirill Pirogov) is a programmer at a history museum, Konstantin (Kostya) Gromov (Alexander Dyachenko) works in security for a bank.\n\nAfter the interview, the friends retire to a bathhouse where Kostya reveals that his twin brother, Dmitry Gromov, is an ice hockey player for the Chicago Blackhawks and is being blackmailed by American kingpin Richard Mennis (Gary Houston). According to Konstantin, Dmitry once played for his home club he was invited by the NHL and emigrated to the United States. After he moved, the Ukrainian mafia moved in on him, demanding protection money. Dmitry (also portrayed by Alexander Dyachenko in a dual role) was desperate and appealed to Mennis for protection. Mennis took him under contract, but it left Dmitry as an indentured servant as all proceeds are paid to Mennis. Konstantin informs that Mennis has come to Moscow to meet his employer, Valentin Belkin (Sergey Makovetsky) to discuss a business proposal.\n\nIn Priozersk, Danila's brother Viktor (Viktor Sukhorukov) watches the interview with their mother. Seeing how her older son has turned into a drunken policeman, she pleads that Viktor travels to Moscow and seek his brother there. After the bathhouse, Danila meets up and begins an affair with pop singer Irina Saltykova (playing herself), who he met at the TV station.\n\nThe next morning, Kostya approaches Belkin and pleads to remind Mennis about his brother. Belkin agrees, but Dmitry Gromov is of little concern to both of them. Belkin, being a Russian kingpin himself, wishes to cooperate with Mennis to legalize their assets. That evening, Danila stops at Kostya's apartment to discover him shot dead.\n\nAfter being briefly arrested and getting into a fight in jail, Danila and Ilya begin planning their revenge in the museum. On the black market, they purchase a CD with personal information about Belkin. They also purchase guns from a neo-Nazi friend of Ilya's. Meanwhile, Viktor has arrived in Moscow and manages to find find Danila in the museum, where he agrees to join their plans, and helps them steal a car.\n\nAs it is the start of the school year of September 1, the gymnasium where Belkin's son Fedya is studying is holding its opening ceremonies. Arriving at the school in the stolen car, Danila introduces himself as Fedya's new teacher and invites Belkin to the staff-room for a private conversation. He confronts Belkin at gunpoint and interrogates him about Kostya's murder. Belkin reveals that it was not his doing, but that of Mennis. Danila leaves Belkin after he pleads for his life.\n\nThe trio clear the museum, and Danila gives Ilya his remaining money to procure passports and tickets to Chicago. It is revealed that Kostya's murder was due to a misunderstanding, as he only wanted him fired. However, the stunt in the school now threatens his whole operation with Mennis. Belkin's thugs and his police contacts begin to search the city for Danila. Danila decides to lay low at Saltykova's apartment and brings Viktor with him. Meanwhile, Belkin's thugs discover the stolen car in the building's parking lot. Saltykova's chauffeur Boris warns Danila, and the Bagrov brothers ambush the mobsters and then lead them on a chase through the town and into a closed alley, where they make quick work of the thugs. News of Bagrov's success concern Belkin's partners, who begin doubting the security of their operation. Learning of the bought tickets under Bagrov's name, Belkin alerts the Ukrainian mafia in Chicago.\n\nTo avoid capture, the brothers fly to America separately, and Viktor arrives in Chicago without any suspicion. Danila instead takes a flight to New York City where he arrives in Brighton Beach. There, he buys a cheap car to travel to Chicago by road, but it breaks down along the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Stranded, he hitches a ride to Chicago with trucker Ben Johnson (Ray Toler). Despite Danila's limited English, the two become close friends and on his way to Chicago, Ben shows Danila much about American life. Upon their arrival in Chicago, Ben drives by prostitutes, one of whom, Marylin, turns out to be a Russian named Dasha (Darya Urgens Lesnikova).\n\nBack in Moscow, Belkin is still determined to catch Danila, but a background check revealed that Viktor was on board the flight to Chicago. Paranoid, Belkin alerts the Ukrainian mafia in Chicago to find him. Meanwhile, Viktor arrives to the Ukrainian district in Chicago. Danila attempts to meet up with Dmitry and Viktor, but is unable to make contact with them. Badly needing a translator, he decides to find Dasha and travels to the neighborhood where she works. Just before he can run away with her, he is savagely beaten by Dasha's pimp's henchmen. The Police let him go on the basis of recognizance and he gets revenge by tricking the same group into selling him weapons, which he steals by subterfuge. Afterwards, Dasha's pimp attempts to get even with her but is in turn killed by Danila, leaving Dasha no choice but to go with him.\n\nDanila and Dasha finally meet up with Viktor and the three enjoy an evening campfire on the beach of Lake Michigan where they share their experiences and attitude towards American society. Dasha tells her story of how she came in the early 1990s as an exchange student, worked in escort service in New York before finally degrading into a street hooker. Viktor, on the other hand, is much too impressed with the power of money that drives America. Danila instead shows his patriotism and offers Dasha to come back home with them, replying to her \"what will I do there?\" with the \"What have you achieved here?\" inferring to her social status. As for Viktor, Danila reminds him there are things that money can't buy. This philosophical discussion is broken by a homeless black man, who stumbles across them and is insulted when Danila called him a negr (not knowing that the word is an insult in English). While waiting for a fight to come, Dasha replies that she believes that the aggressive primal nature of black people drives fear into white people, thus making them ultimately superior. This theory fails its test, when Danila's warning shots into the sand quickly forces the attackers to flee.\n\nRegardless, Danila finally begins to move in against Mennis and first hits his front, the Club Metro. Expecting Mennis to be there he sneaks a weapon into the toilet, and during a Rock concert that evening, involving the Bi-2 band, he kills every member of Mennis' mafia he encounters in the basement. Mennis, alas, is absent. Viktor, himself picked up a tail by the Ukrainian mafia, draws them away and kills their hit-man, but not before learning of the mafia's operations and headquarters. The next morning Danila climbs 50 or so floors on a skyscraper's fire escape to reach Mennis' office. He finds him in a game of chess. Killing his colleague, he finally confronts him alone. As if continuing the debate on the lakeside, in his monologue (in Russian) he asks the American if power really comes from money. Arguing that his brother (whose photo is lying next to the chess table) believes this theory, Danila instead thinks that power lies in the Truth. He (implying Mennis), can be rich, but not strong, as his money he stole from someone else. Thus the tricked person is right, so he is stronger. Almost weeping in fear, Mennis agrees. In conclusion, he demands all of the money he took from Dmitry to be returned.\n\nGiving Dmitry his money, Danila sets off back home to Moscow driving through the Ukrainian neighborhood he witnesses a police siege around the former headquarters of the Ukrainian mafia, where Viktor killed everyone inside. As he is dragged out handcuffed, Viktor shouts his intentions to stay in America. The film ends with Danila and Dasha taking off to Moscow, and the final call to Irina is not intercepted, as presumably, Belkin is also removed by his \"investors\", who in an earlier scene, face to face told him, that the sum of money he set up in this operation is too much to be risked. At the airport, Dasha is told that she will never be able to enter the United States again due to the expiry of her visa, but she does not care, signaling an intention she will never come back."

    "Buccaneer's Girl": "Frederic Baptiste, a gentleman pirate, captures yet another ship belonging to Alexander Narbonne, the wealthy New Orleans shipping magnate, not realizing that among his booty is a stowaway from Boston named Deborah McCoy, who is disguised as a cabin boy. Rather than being put on a lifeboat with the other passengers, Deborah is kept aboard the pirate ship, where she soon attracts Baptiste's attention. When the pirate threatens to maroon her on a small island, Deborah slips ashore while his ship is docked in New Orleans, and is soon hired as an entertainer by Mme. Brizar, the proprietor of a \"School for Genteel Young Ladies.\" After months of training, Deborah is finally sent out on her first assignment, a party held by Captain Robert Kingston, the head of the Seaman's Fund. Deborah is surprised to discover that Robert and Baptiste are one and the same, but she agrees to keep his secret when she learns that Robert has been using his plunder from Narbonne's ships to support the local seamen. In actuality, Robert killed the real Baptiste, who had been hired by Narbonne to destroy the competition, and now pretends to be the pirate in order to raise money to rebuild the local fleet. Robert's ruse is discovered by Narbonne when his thugs steal the sea captain's ring. With the help of Patout, his secretary, Narbonne sets a trap for Robert, not knowing that Deborah has overheard their plotting. Later, Deborah gets into a fight with Robert's fiance, Arlene Villon, the governor's niece, and becomes a fugitive from justice when Villon files assault charges against her. Later, Robert returns to his ship and sets sail, unaware that Deborah is aboard, waiting for him. When Deborah tells Robert what she overheard between Narbonne and Patout, he recognizes Narbonne's deception and changes course in order to attack the French ships that are actually carrying the shipping magnate's riches. After months at sea, Robert successfully sinks Narbonne's three remaining ships, then heads back to New Orleans. Deborah proclaims her love to Robert, but, as a man of honor, he rejects her, having already promised himself to Arlene. Upon arriving in New Orleans, however, Robert learns that Arlene wed Narbonne during his absence, and is further shocked to learn that she sees her marriage merely as a convenience that should not interfere with their romance. When Robert rejects her adulterous proposal, the infuriated Arlene agrees to help prosecute her ex-fiance for piracy. After Robert and his crew are arrested, the sea captain mistakenly believes that Deborah betrayed him. Later, Narbonne offers Robert clemency if he agrees to sign a statement stating that all the money raised by the Seaman's Fund was from his looted ships, but the pirate refuses. He then learns from Patout that it was Arlene who betrayed. Robert and his men are then broken out of jail by Deborah and the local seamen, and the pirates set sail for distant waters, with Robert and Deborah happily united."

    "Buck Privates Come Home": "In this sequel to 'Buck Privates', after serving in Europe during World War II, Herbie Brown (Lou Costello) and Slicker Smith (Bud Abbott) return to the United States aboard a troop ship. Also on board is their old boot camp sergeant, Collins (Nat Pendleton). As the ship nears New York, Collins and his superiors search the men's belongings for contraband. A six-year old French orphan, Evey (Beverly Simmons), whom Herbie and Slicker befriended in France, is found in Herbie's duffle bag. She is handed over to Lieutenant Sylvia Hunter (Joan Fulton) who delivers her to immigration officials in New York. However, during a shift change at the office, Evey is mistaken for a neighborhood kid and set free.\n\nMeanwhile, Herbie and Slicker are back to their pre-war occupation of peddling ties in Times Square. Collins is back at his old job as well, as a police officer assigned to the same beat. He is about to arrest the boys when Evey shows up and helps them escape.\n\nHerbie and Slicker attempt to adopt Evey, but are told that one of them must be married and have a steady income. Evey suggests that Herbie marry Sylvia. They show up at her apartment, but learn that Sylvia already has a boyfriend, Bill Gregory (Tom Brown).\n\nAt one point, Herbie and Slicker purchase what seems to be an ideal home for $750, but the seller doesn't want to let them see the interior prior to purchase. Before Herbie can get the front door open, the seller gives a signal, and a truck hauls off the fa\u00e7ade, revealing that the boys had just purchased a broken down old bus. The two have to fix it up to use as a home.\n\nBill is a midget car racer. He is sure he will win the $20,000 prize at the Gold Cup Stakes, but his car is being held at a local garage until past due bills are paid. Herbie and Slicker use their separation pay and loans from their old service pals to get the car out of hock. Collins, however, has other plans. He had been demoted repeatedly to ever less desirable beats thanks to the boys' escaping from him. He stakes out the garage in hopes of catching them and returning Evey to the immigration authorities to get himself back in good favor with his boss. He eventually chases them to the track, where Herbie gets in Bill's race car and leads everyone on a wild chase through the streets of New York.\n\nHerbie is eventually caught, but not before the head of an automobile company is impressed enough to order twenty cars and 200 engines. With his financial future secure, Bill can now marry Sylvia and adopt Evey. Slicker and Herbie will be allowed to visit Evey if they get jobs. Collins' captain suggests that they join the police force, which they do...with Collins as their instructor!"

    "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century": "In 1987, NASA astronaut Captain William \"Buck\" Rogers (Gil Gerard) is piloting the space shuttle Ranger 3 when he flies into an unexpected space phenomenon and is frozen for 504 years. In the year 2491, his shuttle is found drifting in space by the alien flagship Draconia, which is headed to Earth for a trade conference, under the command of Princess Ardala (Pamela Hensley) and her aide-de-camp, Kane (Henry Silva), a former native of Earth. Rogers is revived from his cryogenic sleep and is questioned by the princess and Kane. Princess Ardala is visibly attracted to Buck, though Kane arranges for Buck to be placed back on his shuttle and returned towards Earth.\n\nIt turns out that the Draconians are actually planning to conquer Earth through staged pirate attacks on Earth's shipping fleet, forcing Earth to seek a treaty with the Draconians and unwittingly opening up their defenses to the invaders. They plant a homing beacon aboard Rogers' shuttle to track a way through Earth's planet-wide defense shield. Buck lands in New Chicago and is immediately taken into custody by Colonel Wilma Deering (Erin Gray), commander of Earth's military forces. He is interrogated and learns that Earth has been rebuilt over the centuries in his absence following a nuclear holocaust, and now much of Earth outside this huge city is a desolate, radioactive wasteland. Over the course of his time in detention, Buck meets Dr. Elias Huer (Tim O'Connor) the leader of Earth's Defense Directorate, the AI computer Dr. Theopolis, and the robot drone Twiki (voice of Mel Blanc), most of whom attempt to help him adjust to his current surroundings.\n\nWhile recounting his encounter with the Draconians, Buck notices several discrepancies and suspects that the Draconians must be armed, contrary to the terms of the trade meeting. Against advice, Buck ventures outside the city to the ruins of old Chicago in an attempt to find out that what he has been told is real, eventually finding his own parents' grave and having to be rescued by Wilma and her troops from the mutants inhabiting the ruins. Following Buck's return to the Inner City, the Draconian tracking device is found aboard his shuttle, and the authorities accuse Buck of espionage and sentence him to death. Buck claims that the Draconians simply used him, and eventually Wilma persuades Dr. Huer to prove Buck's claims by requesting a meeting with Princess Ardala and Kane aboard the Draconia. During the meeting, the pirate ships (actually Draconian marauders) attack their flagship as a diversion, but Buck manages to destroy them single-handedly, thus earning Wilma's respect.\n\nAt the official diplomatic reception on Earth, Ardala, still attracted to Buck, invites him back to the Draconia. Buck uses the invitation to go aboard and find out the truth behind the Draconians' scheme. On the ship, Ardala informs Buck she needs a man such as him to rule by her side and offers Buck the position. After drugging Ardala, Buck explores the ship and discovers their marauders and plans to launch an imminent attack on Earth. Dr. Theopolis and Twiki, who have followed Buck aboard, eventually meet up with him and alert Earth to the Draconian invasion. Wilma immediately scrambles Earth's starfighters and attacks the Draconia, while Buck sabotages the Draconian marauders prepared to attack Earth and fights off Ardala's bodyguard, Tigerman. During the battle, the Draconia is critically damaged, but Buck, Theopolis and Twiki are rescued by Wilma before the ship explodes. Ardala and Kane also escape before the Draconia's destruction in an escape shuttle, while Kane vows to return and to take his revenge on Rogers."

    "Bullet Train": "A former professional assassin code-named Ladybug returns to work with a newly positive attitude, where he is tasked by his handler, Maria Beetle, to collect a briefcase aboard a bullet train travelling from Tokyo to Kyoto after her normal contact, Carver, is forced to call out due to illness. Unbeknownst to Ladybug, three other killers are on board: hit-men brothers Tangerine and Lemon, and deceptively innocent schoolgirl The Prince. Tangerine and Lemon have been hired by White Death, head of the world's largest crime syndicate, who seized control of the Japanese underworld years before.\n\nHaving recovered the crime lord's kidnapped son and the briefcase containing his US$10 million ransom, the brothers are delivering both to Kyoto. The Prince summons another assassin, Yuichi Kimura, to the train, having pushed his young son off a building. With an associate at the hospital ready to finish the boy off, the Prince forces Kimura to cooperate with her plan: rigging the briefcase and Kimura's gun with explosives to kill White Death. Stealing the briefcase, Ladybug is forced to kill another assassin, The Wolf, who arrives seeking revenge for the deaths of his wife and his entire cartel, poisoned at their wedding.\n\nRealising the briefcase is missing, the brothers find White Death's son dead by poisoning. The Prince leads Tangerine to believe Ladybug is responsible, while Ladybug attempts to negotiate with Lemon but is forced to subdue him. Ladybug runs into the Wolf's intended target, The Hornet - the poisoner who massacred his wedding, hired to kill White Death's son. She stabs Ladybug with a syringe of boom-slang venom but he injects her as well, then saves himself with her only dose of anti-venom, and she dies instead.\n\nFighting Tangerine to a stalemate, Ladybug tries to help him convince White Death's men that his son and the briefcase are safe, then kicks Tangerine off the train. Suspicious of Kimura and the Prince, Lemon shoots Kimura but succumbs to a bottle of water drugged by Ladybug, and is shot by the Prince. Climbing back inside the train, Tangerine finds his brother's body and confronts the Prince, but is fatally shot in a scuffle with Ladybug. Kimura's father, The Elder, boards the train and reveals himself as a former Yakuza lieutenant whose wife and clan were killed in White Death's rise to power.\n\nEnsuring his grandson's safety by having the Prince's associate killed, he and Ladybug find Kimura and Lemon still alive, and they all prepare for the ambush awaiting them. The train arrives in Kyoto, and Ladybug is met by White Death and his men. The Prince, revealed to be White Death's disgruntled daughter, tries to goad him into firing Kimura's booby-trapped gun, but he instead tells her she was never part of his plan. The White Death reveals that he hired all the assassins aboard the train as revenge for the murder of his wife.\n\nAfter Tangerine and Lemon massacred his men during a job in Bolivia, his wife was called to bail their son out of jail and was killed by Carver, who meant to assassinate her husband. And the surgeon who was going to save his wife was poisoned by the Hornet, ensuring her death by killing the one person who could've saved her. Blaming the brothers, Carver, the Hornet and his own son, White Death arranged for all the assassins - including the Wolf, and Ladybug, who unwittingly replaced Carver on the train - to kill each other and his son. Before White Death can kill Ladybug, the briefcase bomb is triggered, knocking them both onto the train which Lemon sets back in motion.\n\nAs the train speeds out of control, the Elder duels White Death while Kimura and Ladybug fight off his henchmen. Lemon tackles a thug off the train into the river below, and the train derails, crashing into a nearby town. Ladybug is held at gunpoint by White Death. He attempts to shoot Ladybug, but is killed himself when Kimura's gun explodes. Ladybug, Kimura, and his father are confronted by the murderous Prince, who is run over by Lemon driving a truck carrying tangerines. Maria arrives to rescue Ladybug, who has fully embraced a positive outlook on life."

    "Bulletproof Monk": "In 1943 Tibet, a young monk learns that he has fulfilled a series of prophecies that mark him as his master's successor. Forgoing his name, the monk is entrusted with guarding a scroll with the power to keep whoever possesses it powerful, young, and immune to injury, yet could bring about disaster in the wrong hands. The monk is forced to flee when Nazi soldiers, led by Colonel Strucker, attack his temple and murder his master.\n\nSixty years later, the nameless monk encounters a young pickpocket named Kar fleeing from police, as well as members of a local gang who do not like him pick-pocketing on their turf. When the pair collide with a young girl and put her into the path of an oncoming train, Kar and the monk rescue her. After the pair introduce themselves, Kar steals the scroll from the monk and flees. The monk follows Kar, believing may have fulfilled the first prophecy. When Kar finds himself fighting the local gang's leader, he meets a roguish young woman among them named Jade, whom he falls in love with.\n\nThe following day, Jade attends a museum exhibition where she meets the director of the organization; a woman who is later revealed to be Strucker's young and equally vile granddaughter, Nina. Using the museum as a cover, Nina secretly spearheads Strucker's ongoing hunt for the scroll. Later, Jade chances upon Kar being lectured by the monk and asks him to return her necklace, which he had stolen to earn her esteem. The meeting is interrupted when the monk is forced to run from Strucker's mercenaries, dragging Kar along with him.\n\nWith Kar's help, the monk arrives at a laundromat that secretly houses a group of monks who provide him shelter, and the monk offers to train him as thanks. Later, while training in an abandoned warehouse, Strucker's mercenaries come down on them in force. In the ensuing chase, Kar accidentally drops the scroll from the rooftop, where it is taken by a delighted Nina; however, she later discovers the scroll is a fake. The monk reveals to Kar that the scroll's true text has been tattooed onto his body all along. Angered, Nina visits Kar's home to track the pair down, murdering his employer.\n\nThe monk abandons Kar out of shame, but Kar, filled with newfound purpose, reunites with him at the laundromat. The pair are forced to flee when an ambitious monk betrays their location on Nina. The monks are taken to Strucker's secret facility beneath the museum, where they are forced into Strucker's memory-extracting torture devices; the monk who betrayed them is killed.\n\nSeeking help, Kar and the monk visit Jade at her home, learning that she is the daughter of an imprisoned crime lord. The monk realizes that this fact, coupled with a small scuffle between Kar and Jade inside the house, has fulfilled the second prophecy. A moment later, Nina and her men breach the windows, shooting the monk with a tranquilizer dart and taking him back to the museum. Recognizing Nina from that morning, Jade surmises where the monk was taken and chooses to help rescue him. Meanwhile, Nina suggestively scans the monk's tattoos and inputs the compiled text into Strucker's computer.\n\nStrucker begins reading from the scroll but is interrupted when Jade and Kar breach the gates and launch an explosive attack, taking out most of Strucker's guards. The pair then make their way into the facility through an underground water main, where they become separated. In the sewers Jade is intercepted by Nina, dressed for combat in a military-style jumpsuit and hiding a knife in her boot. After a fierce martial arts duel Jade manages to outwit the overconfident Nina, breaking her leg with a well-placed kick. Despite Nina's injury, Jade beats the crippled blonde into a daze before wrestling to her rear and brutally snapping her neck.\n\nStrucker, dressed in his old uniform, regains his youth after reading from the scroll; however, he finds that the scroll's last verse, which the monk reveals he memorized, is missing. Before Strucker can scan the monk's brain for it, Kar arrives and distracts him, allowing the monk to break free. While Jade works to free the other monks, the nameless monk fights Strucker alongside Kar, knocking him off of the roof and onto live electrical wires.\n\nBelieving that Strucker has been dealt with, the pair reunites with Jade. The contents of the scroll transfer to Kar, as he has fulfilled the third prophecy. Strucker, still alive, attempts to kill Kar but is killed himself by a falling statue. Kar is surprised to find Jade alive after seemingly being shot by Strucker; like Kar, she also fulfilled the three prophecies, and the scroll's power transferred to her as well. The monk, now aged, meets with Kar and Jade the next day, giving each one half of the final verse, deeming them inseparable. The pair wish him a good vacation from his duties before departing to fulfill their new roles."

    "Bullitt": "It is a Friday night in April 1968 in Chicago. Johnny Ross works with his brother Pete; both are involved with organized crime, and \"the Outfit\" is after Johnny Ross because he siphoned off $2 million of their money. Johnny escapes a mass of gunmen outside his office, then greets Pete in the garage of their office building. The two exchange brotherly greetings and go on their way - Johnny drives past yet another attempt on his life while Pete telephones his higher-up and tells them that Johnny escaped.\n\nSaturday afternoon in San Francisco. A man goes to a hotel and asks the desk clerk for a message for \"Johnny Ross\", and seems surprised that no message is there. The man takes a cab and has the driver stop by a phone booth, where the man makes a pair of calls, one of them long-distance. At that point, Sgt. Don Delgetti of the SFPD awakens his partner, Detective Lt. Frank Bullitt, at his apartment. Bullitt has been trying to get some sleep after a case that stretched to 5 AM that morning and grumpily chats with his partner.\n\nAfter showering and getting dressed, Frank Bullitt is driven by Delgetti and another policeman, Sgt. Carl Stanton, to the plush mansion of politician Walter Chalmers, who is entertaining a vast pool of guests at a function. Chalmers tells Frank of a star witness who will testify against the mob - Johnny Ross - and who needs protection through his appearance to testify on Monday morning. Chalmers clearly hopes to use Ross as well as Bullitt to the benefit of his political career, and leaves Frank and his two partners to guard Ross at the Hotel Daniels, a flophouse on the Embarcadero near a highway overpass.\n\nFrank, Delgetti, and Stanton meet the man who had inquired about a Johnny Ross letter, and the man is puzzled about Chalmers putting him up in such a cheap hotel. After phoning his boss, Captain Samuel Bennett, Frank arranges three shifts to guard Ross, with Delgetti going first, then Stanton, then Bullitt.\n\nAround 1am the following morning Stanton gets a call from the front desk claiming that Chalmers and a friend want to see them. Stanton has the two men wait, then calls Frank, who realizes something is wrong and rushes to the Hotel Daniels. Stanton then notices the door to their room is unchained, just as the two men - one white-haired, elderly, and fairly short, the other dark-haired, wearing glasses, and tall, - kick the door open and shoot both he and Ross. Stanton is hit in the leg, crumples to the floor and is kicked in the face by one of the hit men. Ross is shot in the upper chest, neck and head and is thrown back into the wall next to the bed.\n\nDelgetti and ambulances arrive before Frank does, and Frank accompanies Stanton in the ambulance ride to the hospital, where the injured officer describes the gunman, identifies the gun brand (a Winchester pump-action shotgun), and relates that Ross unchained the door, to the puzzlement of Frank.\n\nCaptain Bennett arrives at the hospital after getting a report on the hotel from the SFPD crime lab, and after getting what he can from Frank warns him that Chalmers is livid upon learning of this fiasco and will try to lay the blame on the department in general and Bullitt in particular. For his part, Bullitt is ready when Chalmers arrives and questions him; Chalmers demands to know how Bullitt fouled up the protection detail and Frank pointedly asks Chalmers about Chalmers' deal with Ross, but the oily politician vows to ruin Frank's career if Ross dies - even to the point of requesting a different doctor be assigned to Ross.\n\nA white-haired man - the shotgun killer - appears at the hospital and asks a doctor about a friend of his with a gunshot wound; the doctor tells him that it might be the man on the second floor (Ross), then phones Bullitt. Frank has a policeman guard Ross' room, and when a nurse spots the shotgun killer untaping an ice pick from his leg, Frank chases him through the hospital. Bullitt nearly corners the man in the physical therapy wing in the basement, but the killer eludes him and escapes.\n\nMore bad news arrives when Ross suddenly goes into respiratory failure and dies. Frank tells the doctor not to confirm Ross' death, as Chalmers will ruin them both. Bullitt also believes that the killers, upon knowing they've succeeded, will disappear; the doctor agrees to misplace Ross' medical chart and Frank has Delgetti take Ross' body under the name John Doe to the coroner's office.\n\nWhile Frank goes home to shower and get some rest, Chalmers, accompanied by a posse of assistants and police Captain Baker, arrives at the hospital and immediately demands to know Ross' location. The supervising nurse tells Chalmers that Ross' file has been misplaced. He telephones Bullitt and gets the runaround, and tells Baker to punish Bullitt for the mishap.\n\nFrank and Delgetti, meanwhile, question the Hotel Daniels desk clerk -- he'd been hit & knocked unconscious by the killers. They get a description of the cab Ross arrived in as well as a description of the driver; Frank deduces who drove Ross and rides with the cabbie in question and learns about Ross' phone calls -- the cabbie has a sharp recollection of Ross' stops during the ride & is able to point out that Ross had made a long distance phone call at a phone booth. Frank telephones Eddy, an informant, and they arrange a meeting near Enrico's restaurant, where Eddy tells Frank about the Outfit's pursuit of Ross and what they're after him for.\n\nChalmers, meanwhile, intercepts Captain Bennett while he and his family are going to mass and serves him with a legal writ, duly witnessed by two of Chalmers' aides-de-camp, requiring Bennett to turn in Ross by Monday morning.\n\nAfter being dropped off at his own car at the cabbie's garage - a Ford Mustang - Frank notices that a black Dodge Charger has been following him around the city. He drives around some of the hilly side streets and eludes his pursuers enough to become the pursuer himself. The two mob assassins, realizing they've been outmaneuvered, make a break and a mad high-speed pursuit ensues through the hills of the city and eventually spilling onto a two-lane freeway. The shotgun man finally opens fire on Frank but Frank bumps the Charger as they approach a gas station/repair shop; the Charger flies off the road, plows through the gas station, and explodes as pumps are sheared off, killing both gunmen.\n\nFrank and Delgetti are now angrily questioned by Bennett and Baker and Frank reveals Ross' death, and that a check of phone records shows that Ross called a woman, Dorothy Simmons, staying in a San Mateo hotel hours before his death. Bennett holds the legal writ until Monday morning, giving Frank one day to prove the two men killed in the gas station were Ross' killers. He is driven to the San Mateo hotel by his girlfriend Cathy, but he finds the woman dead. Cathy follows Frank into the room, and is horrified by what she sees there. As they drive back to San Francisco, Cathy confronts Frank about his work, expressing a fear that he is becoming as inhuman in his own way as the criminals that he pursues, and wondering what will happen to them.\n\nLater, Frank and Delgetti search the victim's luggage and discover a travel brochure for Rome and books of travelers checks worth tens of thousands of dollars, made out to Albert Renick and Dorothy Renick, the latter being the real name of the dead woman. Delgetti calls Chicago to fax their passport applications to the SFPD while Frank gets a fingerprint check on Ross at the coroner's office. The fax printout comes through and Bullitt shows that Chalmers had the wrong man the whole time - the man that the police had been guarding was actually Albert Renick, a used car salesman from Chicago - and realizes that Ross has been playing Chalmers by using Albert as a double, in order for Ross to flee the country on Sunday night.\n\nFrank and Delgetti must now comb the San Francisco Airport to find the real Ross while Chalmers, determined to take in the real Ross himself, follows. Renick was originally booked on a flight to Rome, however, after he arrives at the airport, he switches to an earlier flight to London. Frank, going on a hunch when Renick doesn't show at the Rome check-in, gets the airport controllers to order the London plane to return to the terminal, then boards the plane himself to search for Ross, and identifies him by his expression and actions. Ross jumps off the plane through its rear cabin door and runs across the runway, with Frank pursuing. Ross runs back into the terminal as Delgetti arrives with a security guard. Trapped between two automatic doors, Ross tries to shoot his way out and kills a deputy sheriff before Frank shoots Ross dead. Chalmers arrives at the scene and is disgusted that he's lost his star witness, but he leaves without saying a word.\n\nFrank returns home, where Cathy is sleeping, and looks at his reflection in the bathroom mirror as he starts to wash his hands. He begins to wonder if she may be right about him becoming as inhuman as the criminals he pursues. He puts his badge on a table and joins her in bed."

    "Bumblebee": "On Cybertron, the Autobot resistance, led by Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), are on the verge of losing the civil war with the Decepticons and prepare to evacuate the planet. A Decepticon force, led by Soundwave (Jon Bailey) (a Decepticon scientist) and Shockwave (Jon Bailey) (Decepticon communications officer, who houses his minion Ravage in his chest), intercept them during the evacuation, and Optimus sends Autobot scout B-127 to Earth on an escape pod in order to set up a base of operations where the Autobots can regroup. However, Decepticon seekers Starscream, Thundercracker, and Skywarp destroy the launch pad during the escape.\n\nIn 1987, B-127 (Dylan O'Brien) reaches Earth alone, crash-landing in California and disrupting a training exercise by Sector 7, a secret government agency that monitors extraterrestrial activity on Earth. Colonel Jack Burns (John Cena) (Agent of sector 7) presumes B-127 to be a hostile invader and attacks, driving B-127 into the forest, where the Decepticon Blitzwing (David Sobolov) (a Decepticon who transforms into a red/white McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II and is responsible for damaging Bumblebee's voice box) ambushes him. When B-127 refuses to reveal Optimus's whereabouts, Blitzwing tears out his voice box and damages his memory core; despite this, B-127 kills Blitzwing. Before collapsing from his injuries, B-127 scans a nearby 1967 Volkswagen Beetle.\n\nMeanwhile, teenage girl Charlie Watson (Hailee Steinfeld) remains traumatized by the death of her father, and resentful of her mother Sally (Pamela Adlon) for remarrying. Charlie finds a yellow Volkswagen Beetle in a scrapyard belonging to Hank (Len Cariou) (junkyard owner), who gives it to her as an 18th birthday present. Charlie unknowingly activates a homing signal that is detected by Decepticons Shatter (Angela Bassett) (a Decepticon triple-changer who transforms into a red Plymouth GTX and a Harrier Jump Jet) and Dropkick (Justin Theroux) (a Decepticon triple-changer who transforms into a blue AMC Javelin and a Bell AH-1 SuperCobra) as they interrogate and execute Autobot Cliffjumper (Andrew Morgado) on one of Saturn's moons. The pair head to Earth, and pretend to be peacekeepers, persuading Dr. Powell (John Ortiz) and Sector 7, despite Burns' misgivings, to help them find and capture B-127, whom they claim is a fugitive.\n\nWhile Charlie attempts to fix the Beetle, it transforms into the amnesiac B-127, whom she befriends and nicknames \"Bumblebee\". They unlock a message from Optimus urging Bumblebee to defend Earth in their absence, which restores some of his memories. Bumblebee is discovered by Charlie's neighbor Memo (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.), who agrees to protect their secret due to his feelings for Charlie. Left alone, Bumblebee accidentally destroys Charlie's home and causes an energy spike that attracts Sector 7's attention. When Sally blames Charlie for the destruction, Charlie angrily leaves with Bumblebee and Memo, only to be intercepted by Sector 7 and the Decepticons. Bumblebee is captured while Charlie and Memo are returned home.

    "Bunohan: Return to Murder": "The film primarily revolves around the family of Pok Eng (Wan Hanafi Su), a once renowned shadow play puppeteer who has gone out of business following the banning of the performance by the local Islamist state government. He was first married to a mysterious woman known as Mek Yah (Tengku Azura) who he was pressured to divorce because of her unorthodox ways. She bore him his eldest son, llham (Faizal Hussein) who left home at a very young age following his parents' divorce. Pok Eng then remarried, this time to a woman from the city named Mek Na, who he is now separated from and has since returned to the city. Through his second wife, Pok Eng had his middle son, college professor Bakar (Pekin Ibrahim) and the rebellious Adil (Zahiril Adzim), whom his own mother despises for unknown reasons. The family's hometown is in the rural Malaysian town of Bunohan in Kelantan, which is located close to the Thai border.\n\nThe story begins with the youngest brother Adil, who is now a young kick-boxer since leaving home five years ago. He has fallen deeply into debt, with little hope of paying his creditors honestly. In desperation, he agrees to an illegal high-stakes death match at a boxing club on the other side of the border. In the midst of the fight, with Adil losing badly, his best friend Muski (Amerul Affendi) bursts into the ring and breaks up the match, dragging Adil away. Adil and Muski return to Bunohan, where Adil was born and raised. They take refuge at the swamp of Pok Wah (Nam Ron), the owner of the local fight club and Aidil's former mentor. During their journey, Aidil almost gets lost while hallucinating about a familiar looking woman but is quickly rescued by Muski.\n\nMeanwhile, the middle brother, Bakar returns to Bunohan from his comfortable upper-middle class life in Klang Valley on the pretense of looking after his ailing father. In reality, he has plans to manipulate his father into selling their family's land to a large business corporation from Kuala Lumpur for a huge amount of money. Although he is the most successful and educated of his brothers, he is also the greediest. His father refuses to give him their land since he had already received his share and lost it in his previous business ventures. Regardless, Bakar is determined to claim ownership of his family's remaining land, and has plans that will bring disrespect to his family and community.\n\nAt the same time, Peng (Bront Palarae), one of the organizers of the fight in Thailand, sends Ilham, who is now a ruthless hired killer, to find and execute Adil to set an example for their other fighters. Ilham reluctantly goes to Bunohan, which he left many years ago after his estranged father divorced his mother. Upon returning, memories of loneliness and abandonment flood his mind, and he experiences waves of resentment and regret. As Ilham narrows his focus on his target, he learns from an old friend, Jing (Jimmy Lor) that he and the fugitive boxer are actually half-brothers. He then finds his mother's grave in a piece of land near the beach and starts digging for her remains to give her a proper burial. However, he later finds out that his father's new family is planning to sell the land and he goes all out to prevent this from happening.\n\nWhen Bakar learns that Aidil is also back in town, he becomes nervous since he fears his younger brother will come to claim his share of the land. Jolok (Hushairy Hussain), the local don agrees to help Bakar steal the land as long as they can become business partners. Bakar arranges for Jolok to visit his father with a business proposition, all while pretending to not know the man. However, the father knows Jolok's real intentions and sends him away, claiming the land is merely in his name but is not actually his. Regardless, Bakar hires local thugs to dig out the graves. Ilham follows the thugs into the swamp and kills them, but is injured in the process. He is then rescued by the same woman Aidil encountered earlier in his hallucinations.\n\nPart of the land is now the site of Pok Wah's fight club, who received it from Aidil's mother while she taught him traditional medicines. Awang Sonar (Soffi Jikan), who is Pok Wah's partner owes Bakar money. Jolok pays of Awang's debts and now Awang has to repay him with the land. They then organize a match with Aidil against a fighter from Bachok District. Aidil wins the match easily but the money is still not enough to repay Awang's debt.\n\nIlham and Aidil finally come face to face on their father's land. Ilham almost kills his own brother, albeit reluctantly, but is stopped by Pok Wah. While helping them recover from their fight, Pok Wah and Jing reveal that Aidil is not born to Mek Na like what everyone believes. Instead, he was born to both Pok Eng and Mek Yah after their divorce, making him an illegitimate child. Finally realizing why Mek Na despised him, he promises to return home to his father for good after one last fight to help Pok Wah and Awang pay off their debts to Jolok and Bakar. Meanwhile, Pok Eng is visited by the spirit lady that appeared before both Aidil and Ilham before. She turns out to be their mother, Mek Na, who is now a guardian of the land. She asks Pok Eng to come with her, but he refuses, saying that he is not done raising their sons properly and only can come once his duty is completed.\n\nBefore the final fight, Bakar goes to meet Muski and pays him to fight Aidil by promising to pay off his sick mother's medical bills. At the same time, Jolok rigs the match by putting poison into Aidil's medication. During the fifth, Muski unwittingly kills his own best friend in the ring. Meanwhile, while the entire village is at the boxing match, Pok Wah is conducting a cleansing ritual in his land to ward off evil spirits. Bakar shows up uninvited and murders his own father in cold blood. At the same time, Ilham confronts Peng, who has come to the village, and asks him to let his brother go. Unwilling to let Aidil live, Peng stabs Ilham and lives him to die at the swamp.\n\nWith his father and half-brothers now dead, Bakar has full control of his family's land. The film ends with a shot of board proclaiming the development of a new holiday resort on the land that was once owned by the family."

    "Bunraku": "In a hyperreal, hyper-saturated, hyper-driven dystopia, guns are banned upon pain of death and the sword is now king.\n\nNicola the Woodcutter is the most powerful man east of the Atlantic, a shadowy crime boss who rules with an iron fist with the help of his lady Alexandra, a femme fatale with a secret past, and nine diverse assassins and the Red Gang, a force not to be trifled with. His right-hand man is Killer #2, a cold-hearted, smooth-talking, toe-tapping murderer dressed in red and wielding a deadly blade without remorse. The citizens live in fear of this pack of wolves, and wait for the hero who can overthrow the tyrant.\n\nOne night, a mysterious drifter walks into the Horseless Horseman Saloon of the local insurgent bartender and desires two things: a shot of whisky and to kill Nicola. Soon, another stranger enters the bar, a samurai named Yoshi. Yoshi wants to avenge his father by taking back a talisman that Nicola stole from his clan. Armed with crossed destinies and incredible fighting skills and guided by the wisdom of the bartender, the two eventually join forces to bring down the corrupt and contemptuous reign of Nicola and set out on a journey, breaking bones and cracking heads in search for Nicola.\n\nIn an amalgam of samurai film, spaghetti western and chop socky and using a stylish blend of neo-noir, German expressionism and Russian futurism, characters in the world of Bunraku spin and ricochet against a backdrop that resembles a pop-up-book made of origami, ever-changing and whirring like a steam driven Victorian theatre set. It is a universe driven by pugilistic force, delivered in a brash style of amazing physical combat sequences."

    "B\u0101hubali 2: The Conclusion": "Kattappa (Sathyaraj) continues to narrate how he ended up killing Amarendra Baahubali (Prabhas). After vanquishing the Kalakeyas, Amarendra Baahubali is declared as the future king of Mahishmati and Bhallaladeva (Rana Daggubati) is declared as the commander-in-chief. Before the coronation, Rajamatha Sivagami (Ramya Krishnan) begins to look for a bride for Amarendra. She instructs Amarendra and Kattappa to tour the kingdom to understand its current state and its people. Amarendra falls in love with Devasena (Anushka Shetty), a princess of the Kuntala kingdom (7.5 Yojanas in the North from Mahishmati) and the sister of the king of Kuntala. Bhallaladeva learns of Amarendra's attempts to woo Devasena and hatches a plot to drive a wedge between Amarendra and Sivagami by asking for Devasena's hand in marriage for himself. Sivagami, unaware that Amarendra is in love with Devasena, promises Devasena's hand in marriage to Bhallaladeva.\n\nSivagami sends an emissary to the kingdom of Kuntala, who delivers the marriage proposal in a patronizing way. An insulted Devasena rejects the proposal with a scathing reply. Sivagami is enraged to hear Devasena's response and sends an order to Amarendra that Devasena be brought to Mahishmati as a captive. The kingdom of Kuntala is attacked by Pindaris, a Dacoit-like army. Amarendra, with the help of Devasena's maternal uncle, Kumara Varma (Subbaraju), is able to nullify the attack and save Kuntala. Amarendra reveals who he is, promises Devasena that he will protect her honor no matter what and convinces her to come with him to Mahismati as his future bride. Upon reaching Mahismati, the misunderstanding comes to light. When Sivagami delivers an ultimatum to Amarendra that he must either chose the throne or Devasena, he chooses Devasena. Bhallaladeva is crowned king and Amarendra is made the new commander-in-chief. During the coronation ceremony the citizens of Mahishmati clearly display their preference for Amarendra over Bhallaladeva.\n\nAt Devasena's baby shower, Bhallaladeva relieves Amarendra of his duties as commander-in-chief so that Amarendra can be with his wife. Devasena immediately speaks out against the King's manipulation and the mute inaction of Sivagami. Due to further clashes, Devasena and Amarendra are banished from the Palace. Amarendra and Devasena live happily among the people. Bhallaladeva notices that to the people, Amarendra is their king, and hatches a plot with his father Bijjaladeva (Nassar) to convince Sivagami that Amarendra is trying to assassinate him. Bijjaladeva has a mock fight with Bhallaladeva where Bijjal tries to stop Bhalla from hatching a plot to kill Bahubali. The whole scene is witnessed by Kumara Varma. Bhalla throws Bijjala aside. Later, Kumara Varma meets Bijjala, and Bijjala convinces him to attack Bhalla to save Bahubali. Kumara Varma does, not knowing that he has walked into a trap & is killed by Bhalla. Sivagami, convinced that Bhallaladeva's life is under threat and open action would result in factions and civil war, orders Kattappa to assassinate Amarendra. Kattappa, bound by his word to serve the Queen, lures Amarendra by feigning he is in trouble, and then stabs him in the back and kills him.\n\nKattappa learns of Bhallaladeva's treachery and informs Sivagami. Devasena too arrives to learn of her husband's death with her son, in her arms. Sivagami announces the panicked hordes outside her palace that Amarendra is dead and the baby, Mahendra Baahubali, is the new King. As Bhallaladeva and his men are about to seize the queen, she flees with baby Mahendra Baahubali. Devasena is taken prisoner for the next 25 years. The Kuntala Kingdom is destroyed completely by Bhallaladeva. The now ousted Kuntala King (Meka Ramakrishna), leads the rebel group that has indulged in guerrilla warfare against king Bhallaladeva.\n\nAfter listening to the whole story, Mahendra Baahubali alias Shivudu (Prabhas) decides to avenge his father's death by raising his own army with the help of Kattappa and returns to Mahishmati along with Avantika (Tamannaah) and the people of the city. Bhallaladeva once again kidnaps Devasena and seals the palace, but Baahubali, ingenious like his father, manages to enter the palace to capture Bhallaladeva.\n\nBijjala Deva tries to brainwash Kattappa reminding him of his forefather's pledge of their allegiance to protect and defend the throne of Mahismati and their duty to be loyal to the king. Kattappa reminds him that Sivagami had declared Mahendra Baahubali king before her death 25 years back and hence his loyalties instead lie with the rightful king, Baahubali. Bhallaladeva is later defeated by Baahubali and burnt alive on a pyre prepared by Devasena. Ending the cruel regime of Bhallaladeva, Baahubali becomes the new King of Mahishmati with Avantika as his queen, declaring peace and harmony. In the end credits, a child is heard asking an elder whether the son of Mahendra Baahubali will become the next king of Mahishmati. To which, the elder replies: \"Who knows what Lord Shiva is planning!\""

    "B\u0101hubali: The Beginning": "In the ancient Kingdom of Mahishmati in India, Sivagami (Ramya Krishnan), carrying a baby in her arms, emerges from a cave directly next to a waterfall. She is being chased by soldiers. She kills the soldiers but falls into the river nearby. Knowing that she can't be saved, she makes the ultimate sacrifice, her own life, to save the baby. She holds her hand and the child above water, while she drowns herself. Local villagers spot the stranded child and save the infant while Sivagami dies with her finger pointing to the top of the waterfall. Sanga (Rohini) and her husband name the infant Shivudu and raise him as their own son. To prevent anyone from coming for the baby, they seal the cave with a large rock.\n\nShivudu (Prabhas) grows up aspiring to climb the waterfall which irks his mother as she does not want to lose her son. He attempts again and again to climb the massive waterfall but fails. Seeing that his son isn't going to stop climbing she asks Swamiji (Tanikella Bharani) for a solution. He tells her that she has to pour water on Shivling 116 times and only then will Lord Shiva answer her prayers. When Shivudu finds out about it, he picks Shivling on his shoulders and puts it below the waterfall. From the top of the falls, a mask falls in to the lap of Shivudu. After pressing the mask into the dirt, he creates an imprint of the person whom the mask belongs to, a beautiful girl. He tries again to climb the waterfall and seeing visions of the girl whom the mask belongs to, succeeds.\n\nOn top of the waterfall, Shivudu, now called Shiva, discovers that the mask belongs to Avanthika (Tamannaah), a rebellious warrior whose group has indulged in a guerrilla warfare against king Bhallala Deva / Palvaalthevan (Rana Daggubati) of Mahishmati Kingdom. The group intends to rescue former queen Devasena (Anushka Shetty) who is the real mother of Shiva and she has been imprisoned by the king for the past 25 years.\n\nWhile Avanthika initially doubts Shiva's intentions, later she falls in love with him after she finds out that he has climbed the waterfall for her. Shiva pledges to help her in her mission and sneaks into Mahishmati to rescue Devasena. Meanwhile, the king's Royal Guard Kattappa (Sathyaraj), known for his warrior abilities, is making arrangements to erect a large statue of the King. During the celebrations, Shiva infiltrates the boundaries of the Mahismati kingdom. During the erection of the statue, some workers slip & the statue is about to fall, when Shiva steps in and stops the statue from falling all by himself, before rallying the men & erecting the statue correctly. The villagers recognize Shiva as Bahubali & chant his name, which worries Bhallala as no-one has spoken the Bahubali name in his kingdom for 25 yrs.\n\nImpressed by Katappa's skills, a warrior (Sudeep) from a Kingdom in the Eastern region, offers his friendship to Kattappa (this scene takes place earlier). On the other hand, Kattappa and his group, attack Shiva upon the order of the King. After Shiva beheads Bhadra (Bhallala Deva's son), Kattappa drops his weapons on realizing that Shiva is Mahendra Baahubali, the son of late king Amarendra Baahubali. Shiva's adoptive family travel through the cave to join the others and witness his ascension.\n\nA flashback reveals the animosity between cousins Amarendra Baahubali and Bhallala Deva / Palvaalthevan, whose father is Bijjala Deva / Pingaladevan (Nassar). They are both trained in all areas including warfare but both of them have different approach towards kingship. Amarendra Baahubali is liberal to everyone and loves his public and so the public love him but Bhallala Deva has tendency to achieve his goals with any means possible. When a war is waged by another Kingdom, they both are guided by Shivagami that whoever brings the head of the enemy Ruler will be rewarded as the New King.\n\nSivagami is Bijjala's wife & became the caretaker of the kingdom when Amarendra's father & Bijjala's younger brother died in a freak accident. Amarendra's mom died in childbirth. Bijjala saw this as an opportunity to wrest the kingdom for his son, but Sivagami decided to treat both sons equally & let fate decide the future king of Mahismati kingdom.\n\nWhile Amarendra Baahubali uses his skill, cunning and ability to crush the enemy by motivating his troops against the stronger Army, on the other side Bhallala Deva uses all the resources of the Army, killing innocent people as well as the enemy, to win the war. In the end, when Baahubali is on the verge of killing the Enemy Chief, Bhallala Deva kills the Enemy Chief with his ranged weapon, thus taking all the credit of winning the war.\n\nBut Shivagami, who is wise, announces Amarendra Baahubali as the new king because of his nobility and leadership in the war. Kattappa and the others worship him as the king. After the flashback, when Shiva asks Kattappa who killed his father, Kattappa reveals himself as the killer."

    "CHiPS": "The driver in a robbery reveals himself to be an undercover FBI agent named Castillo, and he arrests the criminal who killed his partner a few years ago. Meanwhile, at the training center for the California Highway Patrol, an older rookie motorcycle officer named Jon Baker (Dax Shepard) is being allowed to graduate on a probationary basis. He is a former freestyle motocross racer beginning a new career after his body has been left damaged by his sport. He is on a regimen of pain killers and is living in the guest house, after he and his wife separated when he lost his sponsors. The evaluating officer decides to take sympathy on Baker's sob story and gives him a second chance to succeed, but he has to finish in the top 10 of his class to keep his job. The FBI agent, now undercover as Frank (Ponch) Poncherello (Michael Pe\u00f1a), is sent to the CHP after an armored car robbery, which makes it apparent that there are corrupt cops working in the department (a police car blocked the freeway on which the armored car was travelling, making it easier for the robbers). He is partnered with the rookie Baker, who will be too inexperienced to understand the corruption investigation Ponch will be leading, but can ride a bike (since the robbers are on bikes, Frank's boss thinks Baker can help get undercover quickly).\n\nFrank is constantly irritated by the over active Baker, who keeps writing tickets for minor traffic offenses (as he wants to finish in the top 10). Frank does not want to attract attention and Baker is making it difficult to maintain a low profile. The corrupt officers are seen being led by Lt. Ray Kurtz (Vincent D'Onofrio), who is stealing the money from armored cars to get his heroin-addicted son out of Los Angeles. Ponch argues with his new partner over whether Baker's wife is unfaithful, while Baker gives Ponch unsolicited advice on what he perceives to be a sex addiction.\n\nPonch insults Baker and later Baker saves his life when they are pursuing the robbery suspects. Baker wakes up on a wet morning with pain all over his body and with medication quite a distance away. He has no option but to call Ponch for help. They have a moment together and Ponch reveals to Baker that Ponch is FBI investigating the armored car robberies. They start investigating together, interviewing the widow of the dead police chopper pilot who jumped from his chopper (when asked to by the robber) when the armored car van guard was held captive. The widow reveals that the pilot was gay and the guard was his boyfriend. So the chopper pilot was dating the guard and somehow the robber knew that. This confirms the suspicion that it was an inside job. One witness overhead one robber say LT, which means lieutenant.\n\nPonch & Baker are convinced that Ray is the man behind the robberies. Ponch confronts Ray, but doesn't have any evidence. He gets a call from his boss who informs him that a parallel investigating is underway by another agent, who is tracking the marked bills from one of the robberies and has the money being traced to a drug dealer's house. The house is under surveillance, but Ponch and Baker show up and the suspect (ray's son, who is using the marked bills to buy drugs) tries to escape. Ponch is fired from the FBI when the suspect is killed during the chase. Bakes is seriously injured during the chase (Ray was made aware of the chase by his accomplices, so he took his hummer to rescue his son, but was enraged by seeing him dead and rammed his car into Baker). Baker is hospitalized and his wife does not visit him once. Upon release, Poncho drops him home, only for Baker to see that his wife has sold the home.\n\nHowever, he is sworn into the CHP when he and Baker identify the dead suspect as Ray Kurtz' son. Kurtz sets a trap for them by kidnapping Baker's wife. Baker knows it is a trap but persuades Ponch to go anyway, despite the fact that his wife has just sold their home without his approval. After successfully rounding up the gang of corrupt officers and killing Kurtz, Ponch decides to remain in the CHP."

    "Caliber 9": "Small-time Milanese gangster Ugo Piazza is released from prison after three years. He is immediately harassed by his old gang, led by a powerful American launderer known simply as \"The Americano\" (or \"The Mikado\" in the English dub), who believe that he stole 30,000 US dollars during a robbery shortly before his arrest. Piazza emphatically denies the theft, even under coercion from The Americano's right-hand man Rocco. His girlfriend, go-go dancer Nelly Bordon, also believes he stole the money, as does the police commissario, who unsuccessfully attempts to turn him informant.\n\nPiazza meets his former godfather Don Vincenzo, now a blind old man, and his sole remaining capo Chino. Though Rocco mocks Vincenzo's authority, they still hold a begrudging respect for Chino, who has refused to leave his godfather even after everyone else has. The Americano gives Piazza an ultimatum to return the money and resume working for him, but he still insists he doesn't have it and doesn't know who does. Paranoid about more, similar thefts, Rocco begins killing off his money couriers.\n\nAn exchange Piazza is sent on is crashed by a mysterious assailant in a white scarf (who has been following Piazza since his release), who kills their client and steals the money. The Americano sends Rocco and Piazza to kill the men he believes responsible, but when they arrive they're revealed to be Chino and Don Vincenzo. Piazza refuses to kill his former godfather, but Rocco coldly shoots the old man, while Chino narrowly escapes. The Americano has Piazza beaten for his insubordination, but before he can be killed, Piazza manages to convince him that he doesn't know where the $30,000 are or who stole them, but implicates Rocco and his crew in the theft.\n\nThe Americano retreats to his rural villa with his bodyguards, including Piazza, but is shot and killed in an ambush by a vengeful Chino. Piazza turns his gun on the Americano's men and finishes them off, before Chino dies of his injuries. Piazza travels to an abandoned church and retrieves the $30,000 - revealing he'd orchestrated everything to kill the Americano and keep his money unabated. However, he's picked up by police for driving with an expired license and forced to go to the station for an interview.\n\nWhile in the waiting room, Piazza runs into Rocco (who's being questioned for the shootout at the Americano's house). Rocco, seeing the bag containing the money, tells Piazza he's impressed and offers that the two become partners. Piazza turns him down and is released. He heads to Nelly's house with the money, planning for the two to run away together. She reveals that she had conspired with her secret lover Luca, one of Rocco's crew and the man in the scarf, to get the money from Piazza for themselves. Luca shoots Piazza, but he manages to kill Nelly with a single punch before expiring. Rocco, who had followed Piazza home, bursts in and beats Luca to death in a fit of rage for his betrayal. The police, who had in turn followed Rocco, drag him away from Luca's bloodied corpse."

Terry McMillan, who sheepishly uses sneak tactics to make it to New York without driving his orange Chevorlet Blazer, Beutell Morris, who uses the race as a ruse to help a rich couple deliver their Lincoln Continental to New York without a single scratch, and Sandy, driving a custom blue van with her two waitress friends, Judy and Ginny. What Coy does not know is that his gambler brother Bennie made a deal with mob boss Lester Marks to make sure Coy wins the race as Bennie is in heavy debt to them.\n\nLinda has no choice but to accompany Coy in the race, but eventually decides to leave her in Zippo's company, when Redman starts trying to run him off the road. Not long after, the dirty tricks begin to come into play: Bennie, with the help of his prison escapee friend Sharpe, secretly planted a bomb under Messer's Pantera, which explodes during a police pursuit in the desert and Redman shoots out a tire in Coy's Trans Am. He later beats up Sharpe, posing as a motorcycle cop pretending to stop Coy on a routine traffic stop, and confronts Redman at a roadside grocery store, where they wreck the entire establishment. Redman escapes the melee and shatters the headlights on Coy's car before taking off. That night, Coy notices the broken headlights and winds up totaling his car on a winding mountain road, but not after being loaned a green Ford Mustang by a pair of rural auto mechanics, who are big fans of him.\n\nRedman gets word that Coy is still in the race and is forced to call in more reinforcements to stop him. They mistake Zippo as Coy and beat him to a pulp, with Linda defeating most of the men with judo and karate moves. Coy shows up and learns from Linda that Zippo was actually driving the car that night when a young girl died, resulting in Coy's prosecution. Coy tells Linda that he took the fall for it because Zippo would have never survived in prison. Linda wants to ride with Coy again, for fear of her safety, but Coy says the race is almost over and they will be together soon. Other sub-plots include Jim's Corvette suffering from a damaged fan belt and after unsuccessful attempts to repair it, they try to steal one from a supermarket parking lot, only to be chased away by a suspicious cop and Sandy and her friends duping a pair of handsome patrolmen by having sex with them to avoid a speeding ticket.\n\nAt this point, a half-crazed Redman notices Coy driving into the construction site of an unfinished bridge. He dumps Perman and Sharma out of the car and speeds after him. Coy manages to jump the bridge to the other side, but Redman's brakes give out and pummels down to a fiery death. Meanwhile, Sharpe plans to assassinate Coy using a sniper rifle, not knowing it is actually Zippo driving the car. Sharpe shoots Zippo through the head and loses control of the Trans Am, ejecting Linda in the process, and explodes. Beutell, distracted by the explosion, accidentally knocks down the car Sharpe was laying under, fatally crushing him. Jim and Maryann spot Linda lying on the road and to take her to a nearby hospital, but not after unintentionally causing a multi-car pile-up. At the hospital, the doctor tells them she will be okay and Jim thinks they should forget about the race and go home, but Maryann still wants to push forward, even though they might not win first place.\n\nTerry and his girlfriend Louisa are the first ones to arrive at the finish line, but are disqualified when she blabs that they left their celebratory champagne on the plane. The second one to arrive is Coy, who is greeted by Bennie, but the victory is cut short when a TV cameraman tells Coy about the pile-up, the other red Trans Am destroyed in the explosion, and that Linda was taken to the hospital. Coy learns the truth about the plan Bennie had all along, rips up his race ticket, and heads for the hospital, as a disappointed Lester and his bodyguard escort a doomed Bennie to Lester's limo, as Jim and Maryann arrive and end up the official winners of the race. At the hospital, Coy rushes to Linda's room and is relieved to see her alive, but badly injured, and the two lovingly embrace, as Beutell eventually delivers the now-wrecked Lincoln to the couple standing outside a downtown hotel."

    "Capricorn One": "At Cape Canaveral, Florida on the morning of 4 Jan, NASA readies the spacecraft Capricorn One, the first manned mission to Mars, for launch. As the Command pilot Charles Brubaker and his fellow astronauts, Peter Willis and John Walker, are performing final checks inside the capsule, an official opens the hatch and demands that they leave the craft immediately due to an emergency. From the launch site, they are flown on a NASA Learjet to an abandoned military base in the desert. Meanwhile, the spacecraft is launched, and the control room in Houston, Texas is not aware that it is unmanned. At the base, the director of NASA, Dr. James Kelloway, explains to the astronauts that the life-support system, supplied by a greedy contractor, was recently discovered to be faulty, and it would have only kept them alive for three weeks. However, aborting the mission would destroy NASA's reputation and funding, considering the skepticism for space exploration within the current administration, as well as the waning interest among the public. To reveal the only available solution, Kelloway takes the three astronauts into the warehouse where a set has been built of a space capsule on the Mars surface. He says that mission control in Houston knows nothing of this staging because they are receiving information from the real command module in space, as well as the astronauts' voice and medical data recorded during the practice simulations. Kelloway assures the three men that they are only required to participate in the live television transmissions from the Mars landing and flight. When the module returns to Earth, they will be flown to the ocean landing and placed inside the capsule before the recovery vessel arrives. Charles protests the morality of the scheme and asks what happens if they don't comply. Blaming powerful interests, Kelloway clarifies that their families are being flown back to Houston on a plane rigged with an explosive device that will detonate if the astronauts refuse to cooperate. On 16 Mar, Elliot Whitter, a technician at mission control in Houston, notifies his superior Dr. Bergen that the television signals from Capricorn One are coming in ahead of the spacecraft signals. Dr. Bergen assures him that his console, which has malfunctioned previously, will be checked. Not satisfied, Elliot continues to research the data at home. On 14 May, while Houston mission control receives communication from Capricorn One that they have landed on Mars, Elliot asks Kelloway about the unusual transmission problem. Kelloway pretends to be grateful for his diligence, but dismisses his findings as a failure with the console. As the public watches on television, the astronauts take their first steps on Mars. Later during a game of pool, Elliot complains to his friend Robert Caulfield, a newspaper reporter who covers NASA, that his calculation must be wrong because it indicates that the television signals from the spacecraft are no more than 300 miles away. Their conversation is interrupted when Robert receives an unnecessary telephone call at the bar. When he returns to the pool table, Elliot is no longer there. On the Mars set, while Charles declares to Peter and John that he will not lie to his wife during tomorrow's broadcast, a technician overhears and warns Kelloway. In their final communication before landing, the astronauts speak to their wives from the capsule. At mission control, Kelloway observes closely and is ready to pull the signal if Charles tries to expose the plot. Although he hesitates at first, Charles simply tells Kay that he is going to take their son to Yosemite again as they did last summer. Upon learning that Elliot's phone has been disconnected, Robert arrives at his apartment to discover that someone else now occupies it, and there are no traces of Elliot. When Robert drives away, the brakes on his car fail, and he is unable to stop as the vehicle picks up speed through the streets. However, he manages to survive the plunge when the car careens off a bridge into the water. On 19 Sept, Charles, Peter and John are on board the Learjet flying to the capsule's landing site in the ocean. Meanwhile at mission control in Houston, technicians receive an alert that the heat shields of the capsule have disintegrated during reentry, causing the immediate deaths of the astronauts. Charles, Peter and John are returned to the military base in the desert, and Charles suspects that there must have been a problem with the reentry, which means they are now considered deceased. He proposes they leave the compound at once. They subdue Kelloway's men and seize the Learjet. Soon after takeoff, the plane runs out of fuel, and Charles must make an emergency landing in the desert. After divvying up the survival kit, the three astronauts begin walking in different directions to seek help. Charles instructs his colleagues to fire their flare gun if Kelloway's men capture them. Back in Houston, Robert replays footage of the astronauts' conversations with their wives and notices a confused look on Kay's face when Charles mentioned Yosemite. Later, she explains to Robert that Charles made a simple mistake. Their family vacation last year was not in Yosemite, but Flat Rock, Arizona. Meanwhile, Kelloway's helicopters discover the abandoned Learjet and begin a search for the astronauts, who are now showing signs of exhaustion and dehydration. Charles avoids detection by hiding in the sand and later in a cave, but the helicopters corner John, who has collapsed in a dry riverbed. Charles and Peter spot his flare signal. In the ghost town of Flat Rock, a gunshot is fired in Robert's direction as a warning to end his investigation, but he returns to question Kay further, convinced that Charles was trying to tell her something when he referred to their vacation. Kay shows him home movies from their Flat Rock trip, which documents a film being shot in the town, and she remembers that Charles was amazed how the filmmakers could so convincingly create reality. Back in the desert, Peter struggles to climb a cliff only to have the helicopters waiting for him at the top. Charles notices his flare, and Kelloway now instructs the helicopter pilots to focus the search west, in Charles' direction. Based on the research of his colleague, Judy Drinkwater, Robert drives to the desert to investigate the facility of Jackson, the only abandoned military base within a 300-mile radius of Houston. There, he finds a pendant with the inscription, \"Bru from Kay.\" At a crop dusting company, Robert hires Albain to fly him over the desert to search for Charles. Meanwhile, Charles staggers to a deserted gas station and telephones Kay, who has just left the house with the children to attend the memorial service for the astronauts. Albain and Robert spot Kelloway's helicopters near the gas station and arrive just in time to rescue Charles, who hangs on to the wing of the bi-plane. In a midair pursuit, Albain is able to evade Kelloway's men by blinding the helicopters with crop dusting spray, which causes them to crash into the cliffs. Charles and Robert arrive at the memorial service in Houston while the President of the United States is speaking. Charles runs to the tent where Kay and the others are sitting. Everyone, along with the television cameras, turns to look in disbelief."

    "Captain America": "The film opens in 1936, in Portovenere, Fascist Italy. Child prodigy Tadzio de Santis entertains his family with a piano recital. Armed men enter the house, kidnap the boy, and execute his entire family. The boy has been chosen as a test subject for a secret project to create a super-soldier. The process has been created by scientist, Dr. Maria Vaselli, and has so far only be tested on animals. A rat gained enhanced intelligence and physical properties, though it gained an unusual red color.\n\nWhen the process on Tadzio is about to begin, Vaselli first witnesses the cruel treatment of the boy. She protests about it, and she is almost arrested. She manages to escape, though she hears Tadzio's screams from a distance. The boy has been mutated, and will grow to become the villainous Red Skull.\n\nIn 1943, Vaselli works for the United States and has created an improved version of the super-soldier process, code-named Operation: Rebirth. The first human test subject chosen for the process is Steve Rogers of Redondo Beach, California. He is a patriotic young man, who walks with a limp because of polio. In Redondo Beach, Steve is about to depart, saying goodbye to his widowed mother and his friends. He also has a private talk with his girlfriend Bernice \"Bernie\" Stewart, who promises to wait for his return.\n\nThe process to mutate Steve Rogers takes place in a secret laboratory, hidden in the basement of a nondescript diner. A small crowd of officials witnesses the process. One of them is actually a foreign spy. The process is a success, and the spy congratulates Dr. Vaselli. He then shoots at her, and continues firing around. An enhanced Steve Rogers manages to kill the spy, though he is shot three times in the process. Vaselli dies in Rogers' arms while expressing her hopes for him. The wounded Rogers falls unconscious.\n\nRogers quickly recovers in a hospital, and the military starts training him for his first mission as Captain America. He is given a bullet-proof suit designed by Dr. Vaselli, although he is not impressed by its lack of camouflage features. He is given a specially designed shield as his primary weapon. Following a brief period of training, Captain America is transported to Italy by a military aircraft. He feels that he should have more training.\n\nThe authorities in Italy have created a prototype intercontinental ballistic missile, and the Red Skull is about to fire it against the White House. Captain America infiltrates the facility, and meets the Skull for the first time. In a battle between them, the Skull uses his superior training to defeat Cap. He ties Cap to the missile, but Cap soon grabs one of the Skull's hands. The Skull cuts his own hand with a knife in order to escape. The missile is fired.\n\nIn Washington D.C., young Thomas Kimball does not want to sleep. He sneaks away from his sleeping parents, and prepares to photograph the White House. Just as the missile is about to hit its target, Cap manages kicks one of the missile's fins and changes its course. Kimball is the only witness to the event and gets a close-range photograph of Cap. The missile eventually falls in Alaska, and Captain America is frozen in ice.\n\nShortly after, Thomas Kimball has returned to his hometown of Springfield, Ohio. He discusses what he witnessed with his best friend Sam Kolawetz. The two boys try to determine the identity of the hero in the photograph. They decide that the man was neither Namor the Sub-Mariner, nor the Human Torch. But they don't have a clue who Cap was.\n\nThe following scenes follow Thomas Kimball's life though the following decades. He becomes the town's local hero, serves in war, starts a political career, and is eventually elected President of the United States. In 1993, Kimball wants to sign an environmental treaty and introduce new pro-environmentalist legislation, to face a global crisis. His ideas anger corrupt General Fleming, and other representatives of the the military-industrial complex. They have a secret meeting in Italy to discuss the situation. The Red Skull has become a businessman and crime lord, and leads this meeting. He refuses to assassinate President Kimball, pointing out that he had orchestrated previous political assassinations who turned their victims into martyrs. He instead wants to turn Kimball into a convenient puppet ruler.\n\nMeanwhile in Alaska, a West German research team discovers the frozen Captain America. While examining the block of ice, they accidentally revive Cap. He mistakes them for Nazi agents, because they speak in German. He flees from them, but one of them manages to photograph him. Captain America's picture is printed in several newspapers. Thomas Kimball recognizes the mystery man from his past and informs his best friend, newspaper journalist Sam Kolawetz. Kolawetz intends to find the mystery man. Meanwhile the Skull learns of \"his brother\"'s (as he calls Cap) return. He assigns his daughter and chief assassin Valentina de Santis to find and eliminate Cap.\n\nKolawetz finds Captain America wandering on foot in northern Canada, and helps him escape from Valentina and her henchmen. He informs Cap about the events of the last 50 years, but Cap does not believe him. Cap steal's Kolawetz's car and starts a long journey back to California. He arrives in Redondo Beach in hopes of reconnecting with his family and friends. He finds the city and its people have changed a lot. He locates Bernie's house, and is surprised to find that she is an old woman. He meets Bernie's husband, and their adult daughter Sharon. He learns that Bernie waited for him until 1959, and then married. Cap realizes that he has been missing for 50 years.\n\nUsing past information on Project Rebirth , gathered over many years, Kolawetz manages to locate Bernie and approaches her for information on Steve Rogers. Unknown to him, he was being tracked by Valentina and her henchmen. Valentina shouts Kolawetz and Bernie's husband. She then violently interrogates Bernie, and eventually kills her in cold blood. Steve and Sharon soon learn about what happened, and realize that the Red Skull is responsible.\n\nCap manages to locate Dr. Vaselli's abandoned laboratory and retrieves her private diary. They find some clues on the Red Skull's identity, though Vaselli did not know Tadzio's real name. Meanwhile, President Kimball is abducted from a hotel in Rome. Red Skull starts planning to turn Kimball into a mind-controlled puppet.\n\nCap and Sharon travel to Portovenera, search the formed home of the de Santis family, and discover a sound recording of the executions. They are located and attacked by Valentina and her henchmen. Sharon allows herself to be captured, to allow Cap to escape. Cap infiltrates the castle of the Red Skull, while Kimball and Sharon escape their cells.\n\nRed Skull is confronted by failure and plans to commit suicide. He plans to detonate a nuclear weapon, which will exterminate all life in Southern Europe. He is killed in a final battle with Cap, before he has time to detonate the weapon. Cap also uses his shield to take down Valentina. The released President Kimball signs the environmental treaty. The film ends."

    "Captain America: Civil War": "In 1991, the brainwashed super-soldier James \"Bucky\" Barnes (Sebastian Stan) is dispatched from a Hydra base in Siberia to intercept an automobile carrying a case of super-soldier serum. Barnes is activated using a series of code words written into a Red book. Once activated, Barnes is a compliant soldier. Barnes attacks a Cadillac on an isolated road, which crashes and kills the occupants. Barnes steals the serum from the boot of the car.\n\nIn the present day, approximately one year after Ultron's defeat in the nation of Sokovia at the hands of the Avengers, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) stop Brock Rumlow (Frank Grillo) from stealing a biological weapon from a lab in Lagos. Rumlow steals the weapon and escapes in an armored vehicle despite the best efforts of the Avengers. Rumlow knows that he cannot outrun the Avengers and gives the weapon to his associates for extraction. He stays behind to stop the Avengers. Rumlow blows himself up, hoping to kill Rogers. Before dying Rumlow reveals that Barnes is the buyer and that he remembers Rogers. Romanoff kills the associates to retrieve the biological weapon. When Maximoff tries to displace the blast into the sky with Telekinesis, it destroys a nearby building, killing several Wakandan humanitarian workers.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) informs the Avengers that the United Nations (UN) is preparing to pass the Sokovia Accords, which will establish a UN panel to oversee and control the team. If the Avengers reject the oversight, then they will have to retire. The team is divided: Tony Stark (Robert Downey) supports oversight because of his role in Ultron's creation and Sokovia's destruction, while Rogers has more faith in his own judgment than that of the government. Vision argues that it has been 8 years since Stark announced himself as Iron Man, since then the number of enhanced people and the number of world ending events have both risen exponentially. Vision argues that their strength invites challenge and conflict. Tony, Rhodes, Vision sign the document. Clint retires and Wanda is TBD.\n\nAt a conference in Vienna where the accords are to be ratified, a bomb kills King T'Chaka (John Kani) of Wakanda. Security footage indicates the bomber is Barnes, whom T'Chaka's son, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), vows to kill.\n\nInformed by Sharon Carter (The acting head of SHEILD) (Emily VanCamp), Peggy Carter's grand niece (Peggy Carter was Roger's first true love in the 1940's) of Barnes' whereabouts and the government's intentions to kill him, Rogers intends to bring in Barnes, his childhood friend and war comrade, himself. Rogers and Wilson track Barnes to Bucharest. Barnes insists that he had nothing to do with the bombing in Vienne. Rogers and Wilson attempt to protect him from T'Challa (who appears as the Black Panther and prevents Barnes from escaping) and the authorities, but all four including T'Challa are arrested.\n\nVision stops Wanda from leaving on Stark's orders, moving Wanda from a TBD to firmly anti-oversight. Stark speaks to Rogers and almost convinces him to sign the accords. But Rogers refuses when he finds that Stark has kept Wanda under his custody under the guise of her safety.\n\nHelmut Zemo (Daniel Br\u00fchl) tracks down and kills Barnes' old Hydra handler, stealing a book containing the trigger words that activate Barnes' brainwashing. Zemo questions the handler about the mission report for the 1991 mission carried out by Barnes, before killing him. Infiltrating the Berlin facility where Barnes is held, Zemo recites the words to make Barnes obey him.\n\nZemo questions Barnes about his mission report from 1991, then sends him on a rampage to cover his own escape. Rogers stops Barnes and sneaks him away to a safe-house. When Barnes regains his senses, he explains that Zemo is the real Vienna bomber and wanted the location of the Siberian Hydra base, where other brainwashed \"Winter Soldiers\" are kept in cryogenic stasis. Barnes reveals that after injecting the serum, the super soldiers were trained, but they were barely controllable and had to be put in Statis. Zemo wants control of these soldiers to mount an attack against the Avengers.\n\nUnwilling to wait for authorization to apprehend Zemo, Rogers and Wilson go rogue, and recruit Maximoff, Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner), and Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) to their cause.\n\nWith Ross's permission, Stark assembles a team composed of Romanoff, T'Challa, James Rhodes (Don Cheadle), Vision (Paul Bettany), and Peter Parker (Tom Holland) (Stark offers Peter a serious technology upgrade to bring him to his side) to capture the renegades. Stark's team intercepts Rogers' team at Leipzig/Halle Airport, where they fight until Romanoff allows Rogers and Barnes to escape. The rest of Rogers' team is captured and detained at the Raft prison, while Rhodes is partially paralyzed from the neck down after being inadvertently shot down by Vision, and Romanoff exiles herself.\n\nStark discovers evidence that Barnes was framed by Zemo. He finds that Zemo is a member of the Sokovian intelligence & was directly orchestrating the framing of Barnes. Then Stark visits Wilson, Wanda and Barton, who have been imprisoned by Ross. Stark convinces Wilson to give him Rogers' destination, the Siberian location where Barnes was created by Hydra.\n\nWithout informing Ross, Stark goes to the Siberian Hydra facility and strikes a truce with Rogers and Barnes, unaware they were secretly followed by T'Challa. They discover that the other super-soldiers have been killed by Zemo, who shows them footage from Hydra's archives. Zemo reveals that he lost his entire family in Sokovia and hence wanted to end the Avengers. The footage reveals that Barnes killed Stark's parents during his mission in 1991.\n\nEnraged that Rogers kept this from him, Stark turns on them both, dismembering Barnes' robotic arm. Rogers disables Stark's armor and departs with Barnes, leaving his shield behind, when Stark reminds him that the shield was made by Stark's father & that Rogers doesn't deserve it. Satisfied that he has avenged his family's death in Sokovia by irreparably fracturing the Avengers, Zemo attempts suicide, but T'Challa stops him, and he is taken to the authorities.\n\nIn the aftermath, Stark provides Rhodes with exoskeleton leg braces that allow him to walk again, while Rogers breaks his allies out of the prison. In a mid-credits scene, Barnes, granted asylum in Wakanda by T'Chanka, chooses to return to cryogenic sleep until a cure for his brainwashing is found. In a post-credits scene, Parker tests a new gadget."

    "Captain America: The First Avenger": "Captain America is excavated from a crashed plane along with his shield. Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving), a high-ranking Nazi, in search of a glass cube (the Tesseract). Jonhann is the top-ranking scientist in Nazi Germany, working on superpowers from the Occult. He finds the Tesseract in Norway. In New York, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is a thin asthmatic found ineligible for US military service. He friend James \"Bucky\" Barnes has been accepted & is accepted to 107th infantry.\n\nDr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) notices Steve, & his determination despite his appearance. He is also on the recruitment board & accepts Steve when he applies next. Meanwhile Johann works with Arnim Zola to harness the power of the cube to create energy weapons. They are both part of Hydra which earlier operated under Nazi, but to grow further Johann terminates his association to Hitler & goes independent.\n\nErskine takes Steve for basic training under Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones). Chester is supervising Erskine's super soldier program. Peggy Carter (Haley Atwell) is a British Officer on the platoon. Despite being smallest & weakest, Steve impresses all with his spirit and selflessness. Erskine reveals to Steve that he worked with Johann earlier to create a serum that gives man superhuman strength. When Erskine used it on Johann it backfired & left him as a sinewy red skeleton. Thats when Erskine had to flee & join the US. Erskine performs the procedure on Steve instantly transforming him into a super soldier.\n\nA Nazi spy kills Erskine & steals the last serum & escapes. Steve runs after the perpetrator & captures him, but the perpetrator swallows the vial of cyanide & kills himself. He has a tattoo of Hydra on himself. As Chester & Peggy conduct their investigation, Steve is enlisted by a Senator to raise funds for the bond as a comic superhero Captain America.\n\nHe is taken overseas where he meets Chester & Peggy & finds that the 107th has been captured by Hydra. Eager to save Bucky, Steve wants to go in. Howard is a private defense contractor and friend of Peggy. When Chester refuses to help Steve, Howard air drops Steve behind enemy lines & near Hydra's weapons plant.\n\nSteve comes face to face with Johann & sees his red skull face. Johann escapes with Arnim, & Steve destroys the base & finds a map with the location of rest of Hydra's bases. He rescues Bucky & 500 other men of the 107th. They return with the recovered weapons, much to the astonishment of Chester.\n\nChester offers help to Steve to pursue Johann, but Steve prefers the same team & the rescued prisoners who helped him in their first attack on Hydra. Howard gives Steve a shield made of Vibranium. Lighter than steel & the strongest metal on earth. Peggy is attracted to Steve but finds him kissing another GI & is angry.\n\nSteve manages to destroy many bases of Hydra & even captures Arnim on his journey through the Swiss Alps. But Bucky dies in that operation. Arnim reveals the location of Hydra's last base. Steve goes headfirst into the base & is captured & brought in front of Johann. The rest of the team attacks with surprise.\n\nJohann has created a plane & stacked it with super bombs with the name of each major city in US. He takes off. Steve pursues & kisses Peggy before he jumps on the plane. The plane is powered by the cube. Steve destroys the cube console. As the cube escapes, it opens a space portal & Johann is swept into it & disintegrated. Steve realizes that the plane is on auto pilot. He radios Peggy & begs his forgiveness & dives the plane into the ocean.\n\nSteve awakens in a 1940's hospital. An old-fashioned radio transmits the play-by-play of a Dodger game. He gets up, looks out the windows and watches as the hospital door opens. A young woman (Amanda Righetti) who bears a striking resemblance to Peggy enters. She waits for a response from Steve, who suspiciously looks at her. He asks why the radio is playing a Mets game from May 1941... a game that he was at. She reaches into her pocket and withdraws a Walky-Talky. Two tall soldiers in black uniforms enter the room, and Steve easily tosses them through a wall. Steve steps through the hole and is surprised to see that he was on a movie-set. He runs through the dark corridors, pushes a door open and appears in a modern skyscraper, bustling with people in business suits. He flees the building and finds himself in 2011's Time Square. He peers around, shocked by his surroundings, and watches as numerous matching black SUVs encircle him.\n\nNicky Fury (Samuel L Jackson) steps out and carefully speaks to Steve. He tells him that he's been asleep, in ice, for 70 years. The hospital set was meant to gradually introduce him to modern society. Still perplexed, Steve breathes heavily and sadly tells Fury that he had a date. In a post credit scene, Steve is in an old-fashioned gym. He pummels a punching bag so hard that he knocks it off it's chain and sends it flying across the room. Fury enters the gym and asks Steve if he's had trouble sleeping. Steve cynically asks if Fury has come with another mission. Fury replies to the positive.\n\nSuddenly we see images of all the superheroes, Thor, Tony Stark (from the 'Ironman' movies), Hawkeye, Black Widow, Bruce Banner (from 'Hulk') and other Shield agents preparing for battle. Fury, tells him that \"They're up.\" His personal mission to build an army of superheroes is complete... and to be continued."

    "Captain America: The Winter Soldier": "Two years after the Battle of New York, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) works in Washington D.C. for the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. under Director Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson), while adjusting to contemporary society. Rogers and Agent Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) are sent with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division) counter-terrorism S.T.R.I.K.E. (Special Tactical Reserve for International Key Emergencies) team, led by Agent Rumlow (Frank Grillo), to free hostages aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel from Georges Batroc (Georges St-Pierre) and his mercenaries. Jasper Sitwell is the captain of the S.H.I.E.L.D. ship.\n\nMid-mission, Rogers discovers Romanoff has another agenda: to extract data from the ship's computers for Fury. Georges escapes while Steve discovers what Romanoff is up to. Rogers returns to the Triskelion, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters to confront Fury and is briefed about Project Insight: three Helicarriers linked to spy satellites, designed to preemptively eliminate threats. Rogers is not convinced and says that holding a gun on everyone on Earth cannot be called protection. He argues that the punishment should come after trial, and Project Insight is judge, jury and executioner all in one. Rogers says that Insight is not Freedom, but Fear.\n\nUnable to Decrypt the data recovered by Romanoff, Fury becomes suspicious about Insight and asks senior S.H.I.E.L.D. official Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) to delay the project. Rogers meets Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), who is now an old woman, and has had a full life with a husband and a family. Rogers meets Sam Wilson while doing his morning run, and befriends him. Sam works at the local VA center.\n\nOn his way to rendezvous with Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), Fury is ambushed by assailants led by a mysterious assassin called the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan). Fury escapes to Rogers's apartment and warns Rogers that S.H.I.E.L.D. is compromised. After handing Rogers a flash drive containing data from the ship, Fury is gunned down by the Winter Soldier through the window of Rogers apartment. Rogers pursues the Winter Soldier, but he gets away before Rogers can have a good look at him. Fury dies in surgery, and Hill recovers the body. The next day, Pierce summons Rogers to the Triskelion. Pierce insinuates that Fury was the one who was controlling the pirates led by George Batroc for the stealing & sale of classified information. The sale went sour & that led to the attack & death of Fury.\n\nPierce wants Rogers to hand over anything that Fury shared with him. When Rogers withholds Fury's information, Pierce brands him a fugitive. Rogers manages to escape from Rumlow and his team, who are revealed to be working for Pierce. Hunted by S.T.R.I.K.E., Rogers meets with Romanoff. Romanoff knew that Rogers had hidden the flash drive in a vending machine and initially they both did not trust each other. Romanoff and Rogers realize that they are both looking for the person behind Fury's death. Using data in the flash drive they discover a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. bunker in New Jersey, where they activate a supercomputer containing the preserved consciousness of Arnim Zola (Toby Jones). Zola was a scientist who had worked for the Red Skull. He transferred his consciousness into computers in 1972, after he received a terminal diagnosis.\n\nZola reveals that ever since S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded after World War II, Hydra has secretly operated within its ranks, sowing global chaos with the goal that humanity would willingly surrender its freedom in exchange for security. Zola also reveals that Howard Stark and Fury were killed when they became obstacles to Hydra's plans. The pair narrowly escape death when a S.H.I.E.L.D. missile destroys the bunker. Pierce also uses the opportunity to relaunch project Insight, convincing the council that Fury had delayed it as it would have exposed his own illegal activities. Pierce also engages the Winter Soldier to eliminate Rogers and Romanoff.\n\nRogers and Romanoff enlist the help of former USAF parachute rescue specialist Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), whom Rogers befriended, and acquire his powered \"Falcon\" wing pack. Deducing that S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Jasper Sitwell (Maximiliano Hernandez) (Captain of the SHIELD vessel that was captured by pirates controlled by Fury) is a Hydra mole, they force him to divulge that Zola developed a data-mining algorithm that can identify individuals who might become future threats to Hydra's plans. The algorithm has access to all possible data about an individual including their bank records, SAT scores, phone calls, emails, medical records, voting records, everything. The Insight Helicarriers will sweep the globe, using satellite-guided guns to eliminate these individuals. Rogers, Romanoff, and Wilson are ambushed by the Winter Soldier, who kills Sitwell. During the fight, Rogers recognizes the Winter Soldier as Bucky Barnes, his friend who was captured and experimented upon during WWII. Hill manages to extract the trio to a safe-house where Fury, who had faked his death, is waiting with plans to sabotage the Helicarriers by replacing their controller chips. Fury says that only by faking his own death could he ascertain exactly who was calling the shots at S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nAfter the World Security Council members arrive for the Helicarriers' launch, Rogers broadcasts Hydra's plot to everyone at the Triskelion. Romanoff, disguised as one of the Council members, disarms Pierce. Fury arrives and forces Pierce to unlock S.H.I.E.L.D's database so that Romanoff can leak classified information, exposing Hydra's actions. Following a struggle, Fury shoots Pierce dead. Meanwhile, Rogers and Wilson storm two Helicarriers and replace the controllers, but the Winter Soldier destroys Wilson's suit and fights Rogers on the third. Rogers fends him off and replaces the final chip, allowing Hill to take control and have the vessels destroy each other.\n\nRogers refuses to fight the Winter Soldier in an attempt to reach his friend, but as the ship collides with the Triskelion, Rogers is thrown out into the Potomac River. The Winter Soldier rescues the unconscious Rogers, before disappearing into the woods. With S.H.I.E.L.D. in disarray, Romanoff appears before a Senate subcommittee and Fury, under the cover of his apparent death, heads to Eastern Europe in pursuit of Hydra's remaining cells. Rogers and Wilson decide to track down the Winter Soldier, while Rumlow, who was a double agent for Hydra, is hospitalized following the Triskelion's destruction.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann), at a Hydra lab, proclaims that the \"age of miracles\" has begun as scientists examine an energy-filled scepter and two prisoners: one with superhuman speed, the other with telekinetic powers. In a post-credits scene, the Winter Soldier visits a Bucky memorial at the Smithsonian Institution."

    "Captain Blood": "Late one night in 1685, Irish physician Peter Blood is called to treat his friend Lord Gildoy who has been wounded in a rebellion against England's King James II. While he tends to the injuries, the King's men burst into the room and arrest everyone there as traitors. The trial is quick and unfair. The men are sentenced to death by hanging, but the sentence is commuted when one of the King's advisors recommends selling them as slaves to wealthy landowners in Port Royal, Jamaica. Blood's arrogant attitude offends Port Royal's leading citizen, Colonel Bishop, but it intrigues Bishop's high-spirited niece, Arabella, who bids for him herself. Blood is brutally treated, but Arabella intervenes again and finds him easier work. He forms an escape plan, but on the night set for the escape, Port Royal is fired on by Spanish pirates. In the confusion, the men flee. When Bishop discovers the escape, he vows revenge against Blood. The men have no choice but to become pirates ranging through the Caribbean. During a visit to Tortuga, Blood reluctantly joins forces with the French pirate, Levasseur. The untrustworthy Levasseur boards an English ship, captures two of the passengers and holds them for ransom. They are Lord Willoughby, an emissary of the King, and Arabella, who has been visiting in England, while her uncle, now governor of Jamaica, chases the pirates. To save her from Levasseur, Blood buys her for a handful of pearls. Frustrated, Levasseur demands a fight and is killed in the duel. Misunderstanding everything, Arabella scorns Blood. Stung by her disdain, Blood decides to return her to Port Royal, even though it means his death. In the harbor, they find a battle raging. Willoughby tells the astonished Blood that England and France are at war, and what's more, King James II has been driven from the throne and replaced by King William, who has sent Willoughby to pardon Blood and his men and offer them a commission in the Navy. With one voice, the men vote to fight the French and bravely defeat the fleet. Bishop is removed from his office, Blood is made governor, and Arabella happily agrees to become his wife."

    "Captain Marvel": "In 1995, on the Kree Empire's capital planet of Hala, Starforce member Vers (Brie Larson) (An ex-U.S. Air Force fighter pilot and member of an elite Kree military unit called Starforce, whose DNA was altered during an accident, imbuing her with superhuman strength, energy projection, and flight) suffers from amnesia and recurring nightmares involving an older woman.\n\nYon-Rogg (Jude Law) (The commander of Starforce and Danvers's mentor, who trains Vers to use her new powers), her mentor and commander, trains her to control her abilities, which Yon-Rogg says have been given to her by the Kree. While the Supreme Intelligence (Annette Bening), the artificial intelligence that rules the Kree, urges her to keep her emotions in check. The Supreme Intelligence says that Vers is a victim of the Skrull expansion, and her home world was also attacked by them. This resulted in the attack that fuels Vers's nightmares. The Supreme Intelligence convinces Vers that she has been given a gift by Kree and that it is her duty to serve the Kree people. Unknown to Vers, she has been implanted with a device on her neck, that suppresses her powers and allows the Kree to control her.\n\nVers is assigned to a mission to rescue an undercover operative infiltrating a group of Skrulls, alien shape-Shifters with whom the Kree are at war. The mission is on a Kree border planet called Torfa and the operative has been undercover with Skrull for 3 years now. But the mission was an ambush planned by the Skrulls. Vers is captured by Skrull commander Talos (Ben Mendelsohn) (The shape-shifting leader of the Skrull invasion of Earth). A probe of Vers' memories leads them to Earth. Talos sees in Vers memories that she was an Air Force pilot on Earth and worked with Dr Wendy Lawson who designed a revolutionary light-speed engine, that can help Skrulls win the war against Krees.\n\nVers regains consciousness and confronts Talos. Talos says that these are her memories and the Kree suppressed them. Talos says that Skrull are looking for Dr Lawson and her light speed engine and were headed to Earth based on coordinates retrieved from Vers's memories. Vers escapes in a Skrull escape pod and crash-lands in Los Angeles. Talos and the Skrull start tracking Vers on Earth. Vers contacts Yon-Rogg and reveals her location. Her presence attracts S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) (The future director of S.H.I.E.L.D., who at this time is a low-level bureaucrat) and Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) (A rookie agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who works closely with Fury), whose investigation is interrupted by a Skrull attack. In the ensuing chase, Vers recovers a Skrull crystal containing her extracted memories while Fury kills a Skrull impersonating Coulson. Talos, disguised as Fury's S.H.I.E.L.D. boss Keller, orders Fury to work with Vers under the guise of hunting the Skrulls.\n\nUsing her extracted memories, Vers and Fury go to the Project Pegasus installation at a U.S. Air Force base. They discover Vers was a pilot presumed to have died in 1989 while testing an experimental jet engine designed by Dr. Wendy Lawson (Annette Bening) (Wendy appears to Vers also as an artificial intelligence that is the collective embodiment of the greatest minds of the Kree people, and the ruler of the Kree Empire), whom Vers recognizes as the woman from her nightmares. Fury also picks up a cat named Goose at the Pegasus installation.\n\nThe records in the facility indicate that Wendy died in the crash of the experimental engine along with a pilot and the facility has been trying to cover up this billion-dollar failure ever since. Only Vers knows that the pilot was herself. She also figures from Lawson's handwriting that Lawson was a Kree (wrote in the Kree language). Concerned by the cover-up of these events Fury contacts S.H.I.E.L.D. for back-up & Keller arrives with force.\n\nBut quickly Fury realizes that Keller is a Skrull (when Keller calls Fury by the name Nicholas, when everyone calls him only Fury) and helps Vers fight past his fellow S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to escape in a jet with Lawson's stowaway cat Goose. They fly to Louisiana to meet former pilot Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch) (One of Danvers's oldest friends and a fellow Air Force pilot who goes by the call sign \"Photon\"), the last person to see Vers and Lawson alive. Vers again calls Yon-Rogg who tells Vers that Lawson was working on technology that could help them win the war against Skrull. He dismisses suggestions that Vers was ever on Earth and says that the evidence she found was only Skrull simulations and mind-games.\n\nRambeau and her daughter Monica tell Vers that her real name is Carol Danvers, as she was like family to them before they believed her to have died. Talos arrives at Rambeau home and states that the Skrulls are refugees searching for a new home and Lawson was Mar-Vell, a renegade Kree scientist helping them. Talos plays a recovered recording from Lawson's jet that prompts Danvers to remember the crash: Lawson attempted to destroy the engine to keep its power-core from the Kree but was killed by Yon-Rogg before she could. Destroying the engine herself, Danvers absorbed the energy from the ensuing explosion, giving her the energy-core's powers but allowing her to be taken by Yon-Rogg, who went on to erase these memories.\n\nDanvers, Talos, Fury, and Rambeau locate Lawson's hidden laboratory orbiting Earth. It is sheltering a group of Skrulls, including Talos's family, along with the Tesseract, the energy source that had powered Mar-Vell's engine. Starforce arrive and connect Danvers to the Supreme Intelligence. During their conversation, Danvers rejects the Supreme Intelligence and is able to destroy a Kree implant that was suppressing her powers, allowing her to reach her full potential. In the subsequent battle, Danvers defeats Starforce while the others help the Skrulls escape. Goose is revealed to be a Kree alien Flerken and swallows the Tesseract. Kree forces led by Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) arrive to help defeat the Skrulls but retreat when Danvers destroys an entire star-cruiser. Danvers overpowers Yon-Rogg on Earth and sends him back to Hala with a warning to the Supreme Intelligence.\n\nDanvers departs to help the Skrulls find a new home world, leaving Fury a modified pager to contact her in an emergency. Meanwhile, Fury loses his left eye after it is scratched by Goose. While recovering, he drafts an initiative to locate heroes like Danvers and names it after her Air Force call sign \"Avenger\". In a present-day mid-credits scene, Fury has activated the pager, and it is being monitored by the Avengers when Danvers arrives. A post-credits scene shows Goose throwing-up the Tesseract on Fury's desk."

    "Captain Phillips": "On Mar 28th, 2009, Richard Phillips lives in Underhill, Vermont. He is married to Andrea (Catherine Keener). They have 2 kids Dan (John Magaro) and Mariah (Gigi Raines). Richard reaches Oman to take command of his ship. Shane Murphy (Michael Chernus) is the first officer, Mike Perry (David Warshofsky) the chief engineer, Ken Quinn (Corey Johnson), helmsman, and crew members John Cronan (Chris Mulkey), William Rios (Mark Holden), Ian Waller (Angus MacInnes), Ethan Stoll (Louis Mahoney) and Andrew (Vincenzo Nicoli).\n\nRichard Phillips (Tom Hanks) takes command of the MV Maersk Alabama, an unarmed container ship from Port of Salalah in Oman, with orders to sail through the Gulf of Aden to Mombasa, round the Horn of Africa. The ship is carrying 2400 tons of commercial cargo and 200 tons of food aid, 166 tons of freshwater, 250 metric tons of fuel loaded. Wary of pirate activity off the coast of Somalia, the captain orders strict security precautions on the vessel and carries out practice drills. All orders all the pirate cages and the door to be properly locked.\n\nSomalian pirates are based in the village of Eyl. Pirate Muse is ordered into the sea by his boss, a local Somali faction leader. His gang includes Hufan (Ibrahim Maalim), Assad (Mohamed Ali), Adan Bilal (Barkhad Abdirahman), Walid Elmi (Mahat M. Ali) and Nour Najee. The pirates use a natural stimulant called Khat to maintain their high energy levels and desire to put themselves into danger. Most ships travel across the Somalian basin in a protected convoy, but Muse notices that the Alabama is travelling alone.\n\nDuring a drill, the vessel is chased by Somali pirates in two skiffs; Phillips succeeds in outrunning them when one gives up after hearing Phillips on the radio calling for immediate military air support (a bluff) and the other loses engine power after running into the rough water Captain Phillips created with his ship's propellers. The skiffs retreat to their mother ship. Muse is livid and orders a ladder to be welded together and the engine to be fixed before the following morning.\n\nBack on the Alabama the crew knows that the pirates will return and are afraid. Most of them say that they don't get paid enough for the risks of the job. Richard counters that this is what they signed up for on the Somalian Basin route. He promises to follow the union rules and offload unwilling crew at Mombasa, but before that, there is nothing that can be done.\n\nThe next day one of the skiffs returns with four heavily armed pirates led by Abduwali Muse (Barkhad Abdi); they are carrying a ladder they had hastily welded the night before. Despite the best efforts of Phillips and his crew, the pirates board and take control of the Maersk Alabama, capturing Captain Phillips (he was in the bridge) after he cuts the ship's engine power and tells the crew to hide in the ship's engine room. Phillips offers Muse the contents of the ship's safe ($30,000), but under orders from his boss Muse's plan is to ransom the ship and crew in exchange for millions of dollars of insurance money from the shipping company. Muse is livid when he cannot get the ship underway, and he demands that Richard produces the ship's crew to follow Muse's commands. Muse guesses that the crew is hiding in the engine room and controlling the ship from there.\n\nShane manages to cut the ship's emergency power, plunging the lower decks into darkness. As Muse, the pirate captain, attempts to search the engine room, the crew members overpower him. The Alabama crew negotiates with the other three pirates on the bridge via radio. Richard is also on the bridge with Bilal who has badly injured feet (he cut his feet on glass shards planted by the crew intentionally as they knew that the pirates are bare foot). Richard talks to Muse and offers him the ship's lifeboat, since the pirates don't have their skiff anymore, along with $30,000 in the ship's safe. The crewmen arrange to trade Phillips for Muse and the ship's lifeboat for the pirates to escape. But the pirates take Muse & force Phillips onto the lifeboat and launch it, intending to hold the captain for ransom.\n\nAs the lifeboat heads for the shore, tensions flare between the pirates as they run low on the stimulant herb Khat, lose contact with their mother ship, and are later intercepted by the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Bainbridge. Richard uses the first aid kit to treat Bilal's foot. Muse is under orders from the faction leader to bring Richard as he is their only card to earn some money after the botched ship hijacking. Muse reveals that he hijacked a Greek ship last year and earned $6 million. In the meantime, the Bainbridge's captain Frank Castellano (Yul Vazquez) is ordered to prevent the pirates from reaching the mainland by whatever means necessary. This means that Richard is dispensable if there is a chance of him reaching the mainland. Castellano sends food and supplies to the lifeboat and asks for proof of Richard's life. Muse produces Richard, who tells Castellano that he is in seat 15. Richard knows that the US Navy is not there to negotiate. Najee is not happy with the way Muse is leading the negotiations and wants to act tough. Muse demands $10 million for Richard's release.\n\nOnce additional U.S. Navy ships arrive (The USS Boxer and the USS Haliburton), Phillips attempts to negotiate with Muse, who asserts that he has come too far and will not surrender. Richard says that the Navy will sink the lifeboat rather than let it reach Somalia.\n\nThat night, Phillips is able to escape and swims towards the Navy ships. The navy cannot identify the swimmer as Phillips, and therefore they take no action. The pirates fire shots at him; he swims back to the lifeboat. The further agitated pirates are also unaware that a SEAL Team has parachuted in to intervene. Muse stops Najee from killing Richard.\n\nA SEAL helicopter buzzes the lifeboat, pushing the pirates into a state of panic. Muse holds Richard at gun point and displays him to the helicopter, to get them to withdraw. While three SEAL marksmen get into positions to fire a simultaneous shot at each of the pirates on the lifeboat, Castellano and the SEALs continue to try to negotiate with the pirates, eventually taking the lifeboat under tow. Castellano says the elders of Muse's tribe are also on board to help with the exchange. Eventually, Muse agrees to board the Bainbridge, believing he will join his clan elders in negotiating Phillips's ransom. In the lifeboat, one of the more agitated pirates, Najee (Faysal Ahmed), catches Phillips writing a goodbye note to his wife. When he tries to take the note away, Phillips attacks Najee, but is quickly restrained and beaten.\n\nNajee decides to take full control; the pirates tie Phillips up and blindfold him, and the Bainbridge crew stop the tow. As Phillips is about to be executed, the three SEAL marksmen finally get three clear shots and simultaneously kill the pirates. On board the Bainbridge, Muse is taken into custody and arrested for piracy. Phillips is rescued and treated. He is in shock and disoriented, but he thanks the rescue team for saving his life.\n\nRichard returned to his family on April 17th, while Muse was convicted of piracy and is serving a 33 year prison sentence in Indiana."

    "Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie": "In the town of Piqua, Ohio, two fourth-grade friends and next-door neighbors named George Beard (Kevin Hart) and Harold Hutchins (Thomas Middleditch) are the pranksters at their school, Jerome Horwitz Elementary School. They excessively prank the cruel teachers, with many of these pranks directed at their \"evil\" principal, Benjamin \"Benny\" Krupp (Ed Helms), putting the two at odds with him. The duo also creates comic books about a superhero named Captain Underpants, a character who has superpowers and wears underwear and a cape. They sell these to their schoolmates through a comic company called Treehouse Comix Inc., located in their tree-house. George and Harold's pranks come to an apparent end after they tamper with a toilet invention, the Turbo Toilet 2000, made by the school's local snitch and intellectual, Melvin Sneedley (Jordan Peele). This causes Krupp to decide to separate the boys into different classes and annihilate their friendship when Melvin presents a video clearly showing the prank being performed by George and Harold.\n\nTo prevent this, George hypnotizes Krupp with a 3D Hypno Ring he received out of a cereal box. The boys see that Krupp bears an odd resemblance to Captain Underpants without his toupee and command him to be Captain Underpants. The boys soon learn the severity of their actions when \"Captain Underpants\" begins causing problems around Piqua. To prevent these issues, the boys take him to their tree-house, where they discover that they can turn Captain Underpants back into Krupp by splashing water on him and can turn him back into Captain Underpants by snapping their fingers. Believing that Krupp will continue with his plan to separate them, they decide to settle with Captain Underpants but insist that he be dressed up as Krupp under the pretense of a \"secret identity,\" to which Captain Underpants agrees. His sudden personality change even manages to attract the attention (and affection) of the school's shy lunch lady, Edith (Kristen Schaal).\n\nJust when George and Harold believe that their troubles have ended, Jerome Horwitz Elementary School is visited by an odd, German-accented scientist named Professor Pippy P. Poopypants (Nick Kroll), or as he calls himself, Professor P. Captain Underpants (disguised as Krupp) hires him to be a new teacher, but George and Harold are suspicious of him. As it turns out, Poopypants is seeking to get rid of laughter altogether due to the fact that people have made fun of his name for years. He recruits Melvin to help him, as his brain is incapable of having fun.\n\nAfter Krupp finally separates the boys from a school carnival accident by Captain Underpants, Professor Poopypants tries to take over the town with a giant version of the Turbo Toilet 2000, fueled by the school cafeteria's rotten leftovers left out by Edith and uses Melvin's brain to turn the children into glum, humorless zombies. Captain Underpants tries to stop the villain, but due to having no actual superpowers, is effortlessly defeated and thrown into the toilet. George and Harold are captured and nearly turned into zombies but are able to escape when their laughter damages the Turbo Toilet 2000's computer, restoring the children back to normal. Upon consuming the mutated leftovers, Captain Underpants acquires superpowers and, with George and Harold's help, defeats and shrinks Poopypants, though he escapes shortly thereafter.\n\nKnowing that they can't control Captain Underpants, George and Harold destroy the Hypno Ring to permanently change him back into Krupp. Feeling that Krupp would be nicer if he had friends, the boys set him and lovesick Edith up on a date, thus making Krupp have a change of heart, returns the comics he took away from George and Harold, and even admits their comics are funny. However, the toxic waste from the Turbo Toilet 2000 transforms all the toilets into vicious monsters which attack the restaurant at which Mr. Krupp and Edith are dining. Upon snapping his fingers (accidentally), Mr. Krupp once again becomes Captain Underpants, carrying George and Harold away to help him fight them, much to Edith's surprise and admiration.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, George and Harold realize that the secretary, who they put on the phone before by faking a contest with a cash prize of $2 billion, has been on the phone for the entire film, so they shut off the call, make the secretary angry, and make a new comic based on her reaction."

    "Captive State": "In the year 2019, Chicago is placed under martial law when extraterrestrials invade across the globe. The Drummond family is attempting to flee the city, but every exit is barricaded. After breaking through an unmanned barricade, the car stops inside a tunnel where extraterrestrials are waiting at the other end. Before they can reverse, the aliens attack, vaporizing the father and mother in the front but leaving their two sons alive in the backseats.\n\nNine years later, the world has capitulated to the invaders and submitted to their governing authority, calling the aliens \"The Legislators\", because all subsequent laws and rules of governance come from them. In the years that followed Earth's surrender, the aliens have conscripted humans to build suitable habitats for them far underground called \"Closed Zones\", walled off from the rest of the city with access only granted to high government officials.\n\nGabriel Drummond (Ashton Sanders), the younger son from the opening scene, lives in the impoverished neighborhood of Pilsen. He is confronted by Chicago Police Commander William Mulligan (John Goodman), who was partners with Gabriel's father before the invasion. Mulligan is convinced that the resistance group called Phoenix has not been neutralized, contrary to what the public has been told. Gabriel has no information to give and refuses to snitch anyway.\n\nLater, Gabriel meets with a member of Phoenix to sell a hand rolled cigarette he received from a coworker. The man takes him to Wicker Park, where he meets his brother Rafe (Jonathan Majors), the leader of the resistance. Rafe takes the cigarette and directs Gabriel to leave the area because Phoenix is planning an attack at the upcoming Unity Rally held at Soldier Field. Gabriel rushes to his apartment and begins to hastily pack. As he leaves the apartment, he is confronted again by Mulligan, who had surveillance on him. Gabriel evades Mulligan and goes underground to hide.\n\nThe cigarette given to Rafe contains a code on the paper that allows Rafe's team to access the Special Branch's surveillance system and see where certain individuals are, including their target, as well as deployment patterns for security. Rafe and other Phoenix members attack the Unity Rally, using an invisible alien explosive device to strike against the alien guests when they arrive. The attack initially appears successful, but the city is immediately locked down, with law enforcement swarming the city to locate the attackers. The aliens, angered by the attack, bring in hunters from off-world to seek out the perpetrators. They quickly zero in on Rafe, and his accomplices Anita (Caitlin Ewald) and Daniel (Ben Daniels). Anita is vaporized when she attempts to rush one of the hunters and Daniel ingests cyanide to avoid capture, but Rafe is shot by Mulligan and is arrested.\n\nGabriel emerges from hiding but is later taken into custody during a police raid. Mulligan shows him his brother being tortured for information and convinces him to send a message through the Phoenix communication network in hopes of meeting \"Number One\", the supposed ring-leader of Phoenix. He is eventually led to Jane Doe (Vera Farmiga), a prostitute who runs a brothel in Pilsen. She acknowledges him by name when he arrives, confusing Gabriel, and at that moment a police strike team raids the house and kills Doe.\n\nThe subsequent investigation reveals that Doe had bugged her own residence to record conversations with members of Special Branch whom she had serviced, to glean classified information from them. The tapes reveal that Police Commissioner Eugene Igoe (Kevin Dunn) had divulged sensitive information about the aliens' arrival to Soldier Field which allowed Phoenix to develop their attack strategy. Igoe, along with Rafe, and many others, are deported off-world and Mulligan, declaring the Chicago threat neutralized, is promoted to Acting Commissioner.\n\nMulligan later meets with Gabriel privately, with Gabriel lamenting that Rafe's plan failed. Mulligan, retrieving a box he received from Doe in an encounter earlier in the film, opens it to reveal a BlackBerry phone inside. He removes a memory card which he turns over to Gabriel and suggests that failure was the plan all along. Gabriel takes the card from Mulligan and reviews the contents - a video depicting his own baby shower years earlier before the invasion, where Jane Doe is revealed to have taught at the same school as Gabriel's mother. It was at the shower that they were introduced to Mulligan. Several members of Phoenix were present at the shower and the video closes with Mulligan leaving a kind message for Gabriel inspiring him to carry the torch of Phoenix.\n\nMeanwhile, Mulligan is cleared to go underground and meet with The Legislators in their habitat. As he descends, the same invisible substance that made up the explosive used in the attack at Soldier Field is seen enveloping him, indicating he is part of the resistance, and the plan was orchestrated to get him close enough to deal a fatal blow to The Legislators. During the credits, a map details that the Closed Zone was indeed successfully destroyed, and several other resistances strikes and protests had broken out in cities all over the U.S. and Europe, indicating that the opening exhortation to \"spark a match and ignite a war\" had come to fruition and humanity was overthrowing their alien oppressors."

    "Cardcaptor Sakura: The Sealed Card": "Sakura Kinomoto has become the Clow Mistress and a powerful sorceress in her own right. At the age of ten, she accidentally found the Clow Book, containing the magical Clow Cards created by Clow Reed, and was tasked to capture them after releasing them from the book. Sakura succeeds in capturing the cards and became their master after recognition by their guardians Keroberos and Yue. In a second task, Sakura had to use her own magic to transform the cards in Sakura Cards or they would cease being magical, whilst challenged by Clow Reeds reincarnation Eriol Hiiragizawa. Sakura successfully transforms all the cards and becomes their true mistress. The series, which the film is a continuation of, ended with Sakuras rival-turned-friend Syaoran Li confessing his love to her before leaving for Hong Kong. Sakura remained unsure of how to respond, but her affection for Syaoran led to the creation of a brand new Clow Card, appearing as a winged heart but lacked a name.\n\nThe film opens in the demolished remains of the house owned by Clow Reed/Eriol, but the site begins to tremor. A chair is launched up into the air and crashes back down, revealing a hole beneath where a glowing, unsealed Clow Card lies in darkness. The film cuts to night at Penguin Park in Tomoeda, Japan, where Sakura is practicing her magic against monsters created through the power of the Create Card, and is aided by Keroberos and Yue. The fight ends, and is revealed to be part of a video recording directed by Sakuras best friend and cousin Tomoyo Daidoji. Sakura, Tomoyo and Kero (the smaller form of Keroberos) watch the video in Sakuras bedroom. While Tomoyo and Kero celebrate the film, Sakura is embarrassed by it. Tomoyo skims through the Clow Cards, trying to decide which ones to use in the next video, with Kero objecting to the use of the Change Card, reminding him of its body swapping magic which caused trouble for him and Syaoran.\n\nThe mention of Syaoran causes Sakura to blush, realising she did love Syaoran when she created the unnamed Clow Card. Syaorans voice catches her attention, revealing there is unrecorded footage still on the video of Sakura and Syaoran battling the Bubble Card. Sakura admits to Tomoyo that she does love Syaoran, and intends on telling him face-to-face like he did, gaining Tomoyos support. The next day, Sakura prepares to go to school, even though it is the summer, mainly because her class is performing a play as part of Tomoedas annual Nadeshiko Festival. After being teased by her big brother Toya, Sakura rollerskates to school, but ends up late for the rehearsal, where she is to play the role of a princess opposite Takashi Yamazaki who is playing the prince. The play was written by Naoko Yanagisawa. After school, Sakura and Tomoyo pass by where Eriols house was, now replaced with an amusement park, which will open soon. That night, Sakura rehearses a part of the play at home, but the words remind her of what she will have to say to Syaoran. At the amusement park, the unsealed card materialises above the parks clock tower, taking on the form of a young girl sporting wings. This is the Nothing Card.\n\nSakura and Tomoyo visit the park, but Sakura senses the Clow Cards aura and runs into the park to find. She rounds a corner and collides with someone, who grabs her hand. Sakura apologises but is shocked when her saviour is noneother than Syaoran. Syaorans cousin Meiling runs around the corner, surprising Sakura even more. At Penguin Park, Sakura catches up Meiling who nearly lets slip that she and Tomoyo planned this reunion. Meiling whispers to Sakura that her engagement to Syaoran has ended, following a promise they made that they would end it if Syaoran found someone else who he loved more, namely Sakura. Syaoran asks Tomoyo if she was the one who invited them to Tomoeda, which Tomoyo admits to. She asks him if he wanted to see Sakura again, but he worries that his presence will now force an answer from Sakura. Meiling explains she is staying at Tomoyos mansion during their stay and has to decline Sakuras invitation to dinner since she is going to be busy with Tomoyo, but asks Sakura to treat Syaoran instead, much to Sakura and Syaorans surprise.\n\nAfter Tomoyo and Meiling deliberately make excuses to leave, Sakura takes Syaoran home though the atmosphere between them is awkward, until Sakura attempts to pluck up the courage to confess to Syaoran, only for her attempt to be crashed by Keros sudden appearance when he smells cake. Sakura dashes off to make dinner, leaving Syaoran and Kero to argue to the point that Kero transforms into Keroberos and pins Syaoran to the sofa, mocking him. After dinner, Syaoran and Kero nearly argue again, but Sakura scolds Kero. Sakura takes a second opportunity to confess to Syaoran, only for Toya and his best friend Yukito Tsukishiro, the human form of Yue, enter, with Toya raging upon seeing Syaoran. Syaoran leaves for the night, with Sakura seeing him off, promising to see each other at school tomorrow. Inside, Toya and Yukito have dinner, but Toya is moody because Syaoran returned. Upstairs in Sakuras bedroom, the Clow Cards glow, and the Change Card is stolen by the Nothing Card, unnoticed by Sakura and Kero.\n\nSyaoran and Meiling arrive at school where they reunite with their friends. Meiling goes to Tomoyo, expressing her disappointment that Sakura did not confess, but Tomoyo is pleased, hoping to be able to record Sakuras confession on her trusty video camera. Sakura arrives late again, and shyly says good morning to Syaoran. After school, Sakura and her friends walk through the park, with Meiling none-too-subtly to Sakura that she should pick the right time to confess to Syaoran, though Sakura remains dense to Meilings implications. The group go to buy some juice, but Sakura becomes puzzled by its location, previously using a now-absent mailbox to remember the right street. The group leave, failing to noticing the remains of the mailbox, as if it has been erased from existence.\n\nThat night, Sakura writes a letter to Eriol, who left Tomoeda four months ago back to England with his friends Kaho Mizuki, Spinel Sun and Ruby Moon. Kero also wrote a letter for Spinel, his rival, after completing a video game that day. Sakura falls asleep, as another Clow Card is stolen by the Nothing. A montage follows in school as the class rehearses for the play, with Sakura and Syaoran spending most of the time staring at each other from afar. Sakura catches Syaoran out in the hall and tries to confess, only for it to be stopped when an army of students run by. Tomoyo presents the plays costumes to Sakura and Yamizaki, Sakura wearing a beautiful pink gown, and ends up sharing a far off look with Syaoran.\n\nThat afternoon, Sakura and Syaoran are deliberately left alone together by Tomoyo and Meiling, only for Sakuras fourth attempt at a confession is interrupted by Toya dressed in a rabbit costume, promoting the festival. Yukito scolds Toya and forces him to buy ice cream for Sakura and the others. Sakura and Yukito sit together, with Yukito, who was Sakuras former crush, asking if she has confessed to her true love. Sakura admits she hasnt but will do her best, Yue giving her his support and that of Yue. Another Clow Card is stolen from Sakuras bag, but this time, Sakura senses the cards disappearance and checks her bag. In the park, Sakura tell Syaoran she felt an aura but assumes it was just her imagination. The group discovers a bridge in the park has disappeared. Sakura informs Kero of the missing bridge, but while waving it off, he tells Sakura to keep her cards on hand. Sakura receives a phone call from Meiling, inviting her to the amusement park tomorrow.\n\nThe next day, Sakura is late for the meet up at the amusement park, with Tomoyo and Meiling vowing to get Sakura to confess at the park. In a montage, the group are shown enjoying the day, until Meiling decides to go onto the ferris wheel. Since it is only two people per carriage, Meiling and Tomoyo decide to share one, forcing Sakura and Syaoran to go together. On the ferris wheel, Tomoyo films the carriage that Sakura and Syaoran are in, who sit in their own in uncomfortable silence. Sakura takes the opportunity to tell Syaoran without interference, only for another Clow Card to be stolen. Sakura and Syaoran both spot it and pursue the card as soon as they can exit the ferris wheel.\n\nSensing the aura Sakura felt on the day Syaoran returned, they follow it to the parks funhouse and realise there is a new Clow Card in the attraction. Sakura and Syaoran spot the Nothing Card watching them through a mirror and confront her. Sakura goes to use the Through Card and discovers it has gone missing. Before Sakuras eyes, the Nothing steals three more cards, asking that she return her friends. Sakura summons the Wood Card, but the Nothing steals the card as well before disappearing. Sakura informs Kero of what happened, but is interrupted by a phone call from Eriol, who is aware of what is happening.\n\nEriol explains that the Nothing was created and sealed away by Clow Reed, and acts as a negative counterbalance to the combined powers of the fifty-two original Clow Cards. Now that all of the cards became Sakura Cards, the Nothings seal has been broken and she is stealing the cards to reclaim the balance between the cards creative powers and her own destructive powers. Eriol asks if part of the city have disappeared, causing Sakura to remember the missing mailbox and bridge. Eriol explains the Nothing will continue erasing things, even people, until she regains all of the cards. Eriol tells Sakura that she must seal and transform the Nothing into a Sakura Card, but it will come at a price, namely the love Sakura has for the person she holds most dear. Eriols phone line, which has been protected by an incantation all this time, is destroyed by the Nothing, ending Sakura and Eriols call. Eriol turns to his friends including Kaho Mizuki, who asks if he knows the outcome of the situation, but Eriol does not.\n\nThe next day, the class finish a full rehearsal of the play, with their teacher Mr. Terada rallying everyone for the festival tomorrow. Sakura and Syaoran go outside where it is raining and Sakura explains everything Eriol told her to Syaoran. Sakura recalls that she was briefly trapped in a world without love when she faced the Final Judgement after capturing the Clow Cards, and admits she never wants to see something like that happen again. With no apparent way around it, Syaoran seemingly admits defeat. Sakura asks why he would throw away his love so easily, but Syaoran claims he would rather give up his feelings than see the whole city be destroyed. Hurt by these comments, Sakura runs out into the rain until she meets Yukito. When Sakura is unable to explain what is wrong, Yukito transform into Yue to make it easier for her and learns of the situation and gives Sakura a boost of confidence.\n\nThe day of the Nadeshiko Festival arrives, but Sakura is upset by her situation. Tomoyo, Meiling and Kero are present, with Syaoran standing outside the door. The Nothing appears, stealing another card and leaving a large hole in the middle of the schools running track. Sakura uses the Sleep Card to knock everyone save herself and her friends out, but the Nothing steals Sleep before vanishing. The others wake up, but Yamazaki has hurt his arm, leaving him unfit to participate in the play. Mr. Terada suggests cancelling the play, but Yamazaki objects, telling everyone that Syaoran is a worthy replacement. That night, Tomoyo performs onstage at an amphitheatre before the townsfolk of Tomoeda, while both Sakura and Syaoran are worrying about both performing and the Nothing Card. Tomoyo ends her song and joins Sakura and Kero in a dressing room, telling her friends that every day should be lived well so that there are no regrets.\n\nAt the amphitheatre, Sakuras father Fujitaka ends up sitting beside Tomoyos mother Sonomi, who he and his late wife Nadeshiko are related too. As the play begins, Sonomi has her bodyguards prepare large video equipment to record it. Sakura enters on stage with her friends including Meiling, Sakura playing a princess at a masquerade ball. The plays setting involves two nations battling for a magic stone, but the ball is to uphold peace. Sakura comments she is not a good dancer, but Meiling encourages her to take centre stage and look for a good dancer who will help her. Sakura admits she hates war, prompting Syaoran as a prince to step up and reveal his similar opinions. Syaoran invites Sakura to dance, though admitting he is not very good at it. The two dance onstage, with Kero, Tomoyo, Meiling and an angry Toya watching.\n\nThe play continues, where Syaoran and Sakura are now alone, with Syaoran admitting he is a prince from the warring neighbouring country. Syaoran then confesses his love to Sakura, who is unable to accept her own love for the prince. Most of the onlookers are in tears at this point. Sakura tells Syaoran to erase his feelings of her from his heart and goes to leave in tears, only for the lighting to suddenly explode and the whole city shakes. Realising the Nothing is near, Sakura witnesses most of the Clow Cards being stolen by the Nothing all at once. Huge black orbs spread across the city, erasing great chunks of it, and the audience, Sakuras friends, Fujitaka, Sonomi and Toya are all caught in the Nothings power and disappear. Kero and Yukito transform into Keroberos and Yue, joining Sakura, Syaoran, Tomoyo and Meiling. Sakura decides she must seal the Nothing, and Syaoran agrees to go with her.\n\nTomoyo chimes in, revealing she has made battle costumes for Sakura and Syaoran for the upcoming battle, believing Sakura will return from the fight with a smile. On a rooftop, the group observe the destruction caused by the Nothing. Sakura and Syaoran wear their new battle costumes, Sakura wearing a pink outfit with long gloves, and Syaoran wears a similar green-coloured outfit. The Nothing steals more cards, but Sakura tries using the Windy Card to divert the cards back to her, only for them all to be caught by the Nothing. The whole building shakes, and Sakura spots Tomoyo and Meiling being caught in one of the black orbs. Sakura races to save them, but Syaoran grabs her at the last moment, but their friends disappear. Keroberos and Yue realise the Nothing is hiding out at the amusement park, so the four fly to find her.\n\nThe group land at the park and are immediately set upon by enchanted parts of the park. The Nothing tosses a Viking ship at Sakura, but she evades it by using the Jump Card, which allows her to jump great heights and distances. She leaps up to the rollercoaster but sees the Nothing moving a rollercoaster cart slowly down a hill before she steals the Jump. Sakura flees from the rollercoaster and uses the Time Card to freeze time. The Nothing begins to weaken Times power and steals it. Sakura falls from the rollercoaster but is saved by Keroberos. Yue leaps into battle and tries to shoot the Nothing with an arrow, only for it to be deflected by the Nothings shield, and Yue is consumed by her power. Keroberos follows, launching a blast of fire at her, and tries to strike her from the air, only to be consumed by the Nothings power too.\n\nSyaoran concludes the Nothing can erase the magic made by Clow Reed. Sakura panics, asking what they should do, but turns and finds Syaoran has vanished. Syaoran chases the Nothing who has fled to the ferris wheel. Syaoran leaps onto it to confront her and fires a lightning-based attack at her from his sword, hoping it will convince her to become a card. Sakura runs over, as the Nothing activates its power, obliterating the ferris wheel and taking Syaoran with it. Sakura uses the Fly Card, sprouting wings, and flies to try to save Syaoran, but fails. Realising everyone she loves is gone, Sakura cries and pursues the Nothing as she flies back to the clock tower.\n\nSakura flies up to confront the Nothing, but she steals the Fly Card, causing Sakura to fall down the tower. She grabs onto the clock towers giant pendulum and uses the Shield Card to defend herself when the Nothing breaks the pendulum in two. The pendulum drops to the ground, but Sakura makes it to a staircase spiralling the tower. Syaoran is revealed to have survived the Nothings power and crouches at the bottom of the tower. The Nothing confronts Sakura, glad that she has collected all of her friends. Sakura threatens to seal the Nothing, but she objects, trying to swallow with her powers. Trapped on a ledge, Sakura is approached by the Nothing who asks her why she is trying to take her friends from her, lamenting that she was imprisoned in darkness for so long. Sakura shouts at the Nothing, telling her stealing the cards is no way to make friends. The Clow Cards all escape the Nothing, who asks if they hate her. When the cards return to Sakuras side, she collapses and bursts into tears.\n\nThe Clow Cards form a bridge for Sakura to walk to the Nothing. Sakura walks over to the Nothing, telling her that everything will be alright, and invites her to join her fellow cards out of friendship. The Nothing silently accepts, so Sakura uses her Clow Staff to seal the Nothing, lamenting she was unable to tell Syaoran how she felt. However, as the Nothing turns into a card, her powers suddenly surround Syaoran instead of Sakura. Syaoran realises he was chosen instead of her because he had more magic left, but promises Sakura even if his feelings for her are erased, he will fall in love with her all over again. Syaoran is consumed by the Nothings power, causing Sakura to cry. However, the nameless card she has flies out and intercepts the Nothings magic.\n\nSakura sobs to herself that Syaorans love is gone, only for the nameless card to float down to her, revealed to her fused with the Nothing, and has gained a name The Hope Card. Sakura notices Syaoran looking at her, so she takes the opportunity to confess to him at long last. Syaoran does not react, causing Sakura to start crying again. However, Syaoran suddenly speaks, revealing he too shares her feelings, and his memory of her was not erased after all, thanks to the nameless card intervening with the Nothings powers. Sakura cries tears of joy as the sun rises over Tomoeda and the Nothings destruction is reversed. Outside, Tomoyo, Meiling, Fujitaka, Sonomi, Toya, Kero and Yukito awaken and find the world is back to normal, though Yukito catches Kero moving about.\n\nIn the clock tower, Sakura activates the Jump Card, intending to jump through the hole in the tower to reach Syaoran. Syaoran objects, telling her to wait until the floor reappears. Impatient and ready to hug him, Sakura takes a running jump and springs across the hole to reach Syaoran, proclaiming that she loves him, as the credits roll. A promotional still that came with the DVD revealed that Sakura reached Syaoran, and landed in his arms."

    "Carr\u00e9 de dames pour un as": "(00:00) THE INTERROGATION It's 11:03 p.m., a dark and rainy night, when a dark car stops with the headlights on. Inside, three men are waiting for something: Jesus ('GUY DELORME' (qv)), in a dark brown overcoat, plays cards by himself; Adams ('Henri Lambert' (qv)), in a beige trench-coat, says he wishes to eat ossobucco [marrowbone, Italian cuisine specialty] as he verifies the mechanism of a pistol with silencer; the Driver ('Lionel Vitrant' (qv)) in a white trench-coat, tells them to be quite, and keeps looking at his wrist-watch. [The credits roll on.]\n\nAt 11:05 p.m. sharp, the men leave the car leaving the motor running, and walk away. At a police station, the Photographer ('Michel Vocoret ' (qv)) takes a photo of suspect #75161. One negative falls to the floor, and the Detective ('Jean-Pierre Darras' (qv)) in charge of the interrogation asks for another one, the fifth. The suspect identifies himself as Hakim Gregory ('Fran\u00e7ois Maistre' (qv)) and keeps very calm, possibly from hearing the Deputy Detective reporting that the raid on Gregory's loft had not furnished further evidence. An Accomplice ('Paul Pavel' (qv)) is being interrogated at the next room by the Deputy Detective. Suddenly, the three men from the car are inside the police station, armed with silencer guns, and killing swiftly the unsuspecting police photographer and detectives. Then, on a sign by Gregory, J\u00e9sus shoots down their Accomplice. Gregory erases his fingerprints and destroys the statement he had signed (though Gregory is only a pseudonym). On their way out, they pass by the body of a uniformed policeman, as Lafleur, another uniformed policemen who had opened the door for them, escorts them to the door. Then, after saying good-bye to Lafleur, J\u00e9sus shoots him, too, point blank.\n\n(06:00) THE ESCAPE Gregory and his three henchmen are going to Spain in his car. Gregory is displeased when he notices that Adams missed the fifth photo in the photographer's camera. That fifth photo is processed and shown at a meeting by Senior Police Officer Marvier ('Henri Cr\u00e9mieux' (qv)) to a Government Official ('Michel Duplaix' (qv)) who wants to know exactly who Gregory is. Gregory's CV represents 12 kilos of reports: among other cases, Embassy at Ankara, a terrorist attack, arms trafficking in China, bomb hidden in a piano of an African minister, abduction of an Albanian general, and the day before, six killings at the police station. With Marvier, there are three agents present.\n\n(09:00) In Spain, at Gregory's farm, the Doctor who had conducted a facial surgery on Gregory two weeks before, is satisfied with his work, but adjourns the lifting of the bandages yet for one day. Dolores Arrabal ('Sylva Koscina' (qv)), on a signal from Gregory, hands him two wads of bankotes, one for the surgery, and the other for his silence. Gregory takes a pistol from the pocket of his pajamas, hands it to Pablo Gomez ('FRANCISCO PIQUER' (qv)), and motions him to kill the Doctor. Reluctantly, Gomez obeys. Gregory is not speaking, due to his operation, but he writes a note to Dolores, enquiring about Cervant\u00e8s.\n\n(10:20) At the Hotel Al-Andalus, Torremolinos (Malaga, Spain), the Hotel Manager hands the key to a new customer - one of Marvier's agents - and answers that he does not know the person in the photograph he is shown. The Manager makes a phone call, and as soon as the agent enters his room, he is slain by a man with a razor-blade. Marvier keeps very calm, and sends a second agent to Torremolinos, warning him not to be confounded by the simplest problem. [A play on words in French: \"il ne faut pas se noyer dans un verre d'eau\", as the agent is found murdered soon after in a cemetery, drowned in a cask of water.] A third agent is following Dolores and Gomez' steps in Malaga, and is shot dead on the street by a gun with silencer before he can send in his report to Marvier. Marvier keeps calm, but his Superior Officer remarks that the inquest has already attained a high degree of casualties. He gives him a fornight to solve the case, or his position will be at risk.\n\n(12:25) THE MISSION Daniel Layton ('Roger Hanin' (qv)) is in bed kissing his fianc\u00e9e, Marion ('Catherine All\u00e9gret' (qv)). He complains that she's leaving in a hurry, to attend to her bus load of old spinsters and widows waiting for her, their tour guide. He receives a call from his chief, giving him a rendez-vous, and now it's him who hurries out of bed. Marion asks him when will they get married, and he dodges the question. Then, she menaces him that if he is not at home, waiting for her faithfully, when she returns in a fornight, she will beat him up, hard. Layton takes a hike in the tourist bus to arrive quickly at his destination. The American Tourist ('Olga Val\u00e9ry' (qv)) sitting next to Layton in the bus asks him the name of the river, and - since he does not speak English - he tells her,\"It's the French Tamise [sic].\" As they pass in front of Les Invalides, Layton spreads confusion between Napol\u00e9on's tomb, and the cognac... He kisses Marion good-bye and enters a shop - as he hides from her his true profession of secret agent - and next he goes to the rendez-vos he had been given by phone. At one exhibition room of weapons and uniforms of Les Invalides, Layton meets with his contact, Petula Menendez ('Dominique Wilms' (qv)). She tells him they are going to Malaga, and he asks why he has been selected. Petula replies quickly, without details: \"Because B-14, B-15, and B-16 are not available.\" Layton enquires, with pity: \"Are they ill?\" Petula, dispationately: \"B-14 with a slit throat, B-15 drowned, and B-16 stabbed.\" - \"And what will be my code number?\" - \"B-17.\" The objective is \"Gregory - spy, sadist, and murderer.\" A Man With a Cigarette Off ('Serge Gainsbourg' (qv)) interrupts, asking Layton for a lighter. After the man goes, Layton says to Petulia, \"If we were in a spy movie, this one would play the traitor.\" Petula tells him quickly about details of their journey. He asks if they are going on a holliday. \"No, as tourists,\" she says without a smile. \"My name is Petula Menendez, a rich heiress, and I'll be paying for you. You're my playboy.\" Layton does not seem happy at the prospect, and asks what will happen if Gregory kills him. \"No problem. You'll be replaced by a subtitute - everything has been accounted for.\"\n\n(17:30) SPAIN In Spain, the odd couple drives south in a convertible, and Layton does not seem fond of Petula's other companion, Alexandre - her pekinois pet. Suddenly, Petula stops the car and kisses Layton passionately - to try it, she explains after. The kiss was watched by a Man with a Donkey, either for the surprise effect, or because he was expecting the car to pass... Petulia kept driving to Torremolinos.\n\nMarion is distributing the passports after the tourists' check in at the hotel, and wishing them a calm stay in town... Marion sees Daniel picking up Alexander from the floor in the lobby, as the doors of the lift close, but when she manages to stop the lift and goes down to check, he his gone already. Marion and Daniel are given room 330, and Daniel stays at the door, tipping the two boys and the two maids who carried their luggage, and the four bow and thank Marion inside the room, without turning their eyes to Layton... Petula speaks words of passion to Layton, as she inspects the room for hidden microphones, and finds none. His time to impress her, going to the bathroom and finding quickly a microphone hidden in the mains box. They hear a knock on the door, and hurry to the bedroom, where Petula makes a big play of hugging, and kissing him on a couch - as the knocks on the door become more insistent. \"Come in!\" commands Petula, expecting a hotel maid.\n\n(21:35) Instead, it's Marion, in her skirt and white shirt uniform, in a fit of jealousy. Petulia, still her heel shoes and sleeveless, low cut red top and trousers, does not stop the kiss, but Layton has turned his head to the door, sees his fianc\u00e9e, and says, \"What a wonderful surprise!\"\n\nPetula stands up in a hurry, but Marion slugs the surprised blonde, knocking her to the floor. Her second punch is a right to Layton's jaw. Marion tries to hit him with decoration objects in the room, and misses. Petula takes off her shoes, shoves Marion onto her back, and prepared to jump on her. Marion stands up swiftly, head butts Petula who falls back and rolls sideways, so not to take Marion who attempted to body slam her down. Even so, Marion throws a right-left combination of punches to good effect. Petula answers with a punch to the stomach, and then a nose lock, throwing Marion aside by that rare wrestling hold. Petula applies a arm lock on Marion's right arm, forcing her to scream in pain. When Marion's arm is at breaking point, Layton orders, \"Break!\" He helps both girls up, and says, \"Now I notice that I've not introduced you to each other.\" Both girls deliver punches to his jaw, he goes down again, and they procceed their fight. Marion punches Petula, and hides in the bathroom, closing the sliding door. In her haste, Petula punches the door instead of Marion. Marion jigs around, with muffled screams of pain, while Layton sits on the coach, smoking a cigarette, making small talk with her about the weather. A bellboy enters the room with a tray with their breakfast, and is knocked to his knees with a karate chop to the neck delivered by Marion - who expected Petulia to be standing in front of the bathroom door. Layton takes the tray from the bellboy's hands and tells him to be at ease... which he does, falling asleep on the rug. Petulia throws a good punch to Marion, who escapes into the corridor by the door left open by the bellboy. In the corridor, the women trade punches, attracting the attention of some tourists, and the Man in Room 332, who comes to the door, topless and holding a shaving blade - the killer of B-14, B-15, and B-16... He locks eyes with Layton for a moment. Layton grabs both girls by the scruff of their necks, pleading with them to stop the fight, and not to further wake up the people's attentions. Their answer is to deliver simultaneous punches to Layton's stomach, winding him, and then getting at each other again. They made it to the floor's lift lobby and start strangling each other, followed by the tourists coming from the forth floor by the staircase. A pair of tourists manage to separate the two wildcats. Layton approaches them, kisses Marion lightly on the lips, and asks, \"Apart from this, are there any news?\" Layton whistles, and goes away, but before he does, Marion says, with a tone of finality, \"Layton... good-bye!\"\n\nPetula makes a scene to Layton, and throws him out of the door. The Man in Room 332, now impeccably shaved and dressed, comes out again, menacing Layton. Using the noises of the women tourists as an excuse, Layton picks up his suit case and runs down the stairs to the main lobby. He calls Marion at her room, but she hangs him off. Marion regrets it, and tries to call him back, but it's too late - he left the hotel with his luggage.\n\n(26:50) Layton tries to find a Enrique Manega at a small pension in the town's old district. The Spanish Landlady ('Ren\u00e9e Gard\u00e8s' (qv), 80-year-old) sends him up the stairs (no lift) without paying him any attention. Layton goes up, and tries the doors; the first that is open gives to a room, where there is a redhead standing on a chair, wearing black heels and a screaming red dress. \"I'm Ros\u00e1rio,\" ('LAURA VALENZUELA' (qv)), she presents herself. She shows him an empty room where he can stay, which happens to be next door to hers.\n\n(28:30) POKER GAME Next, after a whisky at the pention's bar, Layton enters a private room, just beyond a green curtain, where a game of poker is in progress. Back to the door, a Poker Player in a Brown Suit ('Sylvain Levignac' (qv)), and to his right [counterclockwise] Manuel, a Poker Player with Pox Face ('Rico Lopez '), a Bald Poker Player, and a Poker.Player with a Cigarillo ('Michel Charrel ' (qv)). Before Layton entered, Ros\u00e1rio practically forced the bald player to stay, and risk his last banknote, and now Layton noticed that Ros\u00e1rio, standing behind him, made signs to the man smoking a cigar about the sort of cards he had. Layton plays several winning hands, and then as the bets grew in value, and Ros\u00e1rio kept behind him caressing his shoulders, he lost. He says he only has some French money - as the table was accepting US Dollars only - but that was no problem. The man in the brown suit picks up a small iron box from a drawer, and lends Layton some more American money. They play, Dolor\u00e8s makes the conventional signs, and to the men's and Dolor\u00e8s' surprise, Layton wins by producing an unexpected Queen in his hand... He picks up the money to leave, pretexting he has to a consultation with his doctor, and two of the men accuse him of being a cheater. Calmly, Layton says he is being insulted, and he must beat them. The man of the pox face pulls a flickblade, and Layton overturns the samll poker table. A fist fight follows between him and the men, and when the man with the flickblade was about to cut Layton's throat, he is stopped by Enrique Manega ('Jos\u00e9 Jaspe' (qv)). The three crooks leave unhappy, and one gives Layton the money they had already taken from him. Layton asks his old friend from the French Legion, about Dolor\u00e8s, pretexting his interest is just that of a man for a pretty woman. He knows her, and even his current companion, and where they are staying, in a cattle raising farm in the Sierra Nevada.\n\n(34:50) DOLORES That same evening, Layton breaks into Dolor\u00e8s fashion design boutique, and inspects her safe, without finding anything of interest. He was about to leave when a Night-guard ('Jean Minisini' (qv)) comes in, aparently a guard, and he has to fight him and knock him out to escape. Suddenly, Layton decides to get back to the room with the safe, re-opens it, takes some paper money, and throws documents around, to give the impression that a real burglar had been in there. Through the curtained window, he can see Dolor\u00e8s Arrabal in the opposit window, talking with a man. Layton gets out from the fashion boutique by the window, while Dolor\u00e8s and her brother Pablo are having a discussion and an exchange of slaps, because of his tendency to drink too much. He says, \"I drink because of you, or thanks to you... I don't know any more if I drink to kill, or if I kill to drink.\" The clock chimes eleven. He asks her for money, as he intends to leave the country and be... a football player! She hands him a large stash of banknotes, but he demands no less than five million. He knows her companion, Mishra, can afford it. Layton follows Pablo in the street, without noticing that he is being followed in turn by Ros\u00e1rio. Dolor\u00e8s calls Mishra, and tells him what happened. Layton follows Pablo, as he visits bars with music, first a Caribbean bar, then a Flamenco one, where he talks briefly with a Blonde Dancer ('Elisa Mont\u00e9s' (qv)?), and last a piano bar. Layton fails to rob an object that belongs to Mishra, and with which Pablo is making the extortion for the five millions at the last bar, and keeps following him - to the Ascencion Hotel, linked to the bar Don Quijote, where a girl is singing to the sound of guitars. Pablo picks up a fight with a couple of customers, and is bounced out to the street. layton is there, offering a hand to lift him up, and to pick the object from Pablo's pocket without him noticing. Pablo opens his room at the hotel and puts the light on - and sees his sister, Misrah Petrich ('Luis Pe\u00f1a' (qv)), J\u00e9sus, Adams, and Gregory's Driver waiting for him. he tries to escape, but Adams catches him and brings him inside the room. Mishra slaps him, and then gives him the good evening salute. Mishra demands the piece that belongs to him, and Pablo Gomez, not knowing he has been robbed, keeps demanding the five millions. After a couple of hard punches to the stomach, he decides to give the thing to Mishra - only to discover he has been robbed. Beignard stays alone with Gomez, while in his room Layton puzzles over the valuable thing he has unwrapped: a set of false teeth! On one of the plates, it's inscribed, \"Cervant\u00e8s XXVI\". There was also a dental X-ray marked \"18 VIII 65\". He hides the little clutch bag with both items in a decorative copper vessel in the corridor, just when Ros\u00e0rio is leaving the common bathroom dressed in a towell, walking on naked feet to her room. He asks to play a game of cards with her, but she discourages him, and closes the door behind her. She was already getting naked when Layton enters the room, saying he supposed it was his, but talking of the hot evening, he starts undressing too. Rosario does not seem concerned that he is nude in her bed...\n\n(52:00) THE DENTURE Next morning, Layton pays a visit at Dr. Cervant\u00e8s, the dentist. He rings several times, but without waiting for someone to open the door, he prepares to break him. To his surprise, Dolores Arrabal opens the door, dressed as a nurse. Judging from the dust on the furniture and sofas, the sitting room has not been used or maintained for a long time. He goes out looking for the nurse, and finds she is gone; also, the dentist's cabinet is covered by cobwebs. He goes through the cabinet's files without noticing anything. Leaving the building, at the inner patio, he crosses Cervant\u00e8s Landlady, and she informs him that the doctor had died of an accident: he had had a very close shave! Meanwhile, Dolores Arrabal had been inside a plasterer shop, waiting to see Layton leave the premises, before taking her sports car, and driving away.\n\n(54:30) At his room, Pablo wakes up gagged, and tortured by his guardian, Beignard. J\u00e9sus and Adams give him a little of the rests of their breakfast. Layton was waiting in the corridor, and using the surprise effect, he punches both henchmen and gets inside the room. The fist fight takes long, and the furniture is being demlished when some body blows or kicks miss. In the car, Beignard looks at his wrist watch, in his impeccable driver uniform - until he decides to go up and see what's causing the delay. Layton knocks out J\u00e9sus, hears the last words of Pablo Gomez - that Hakim Gregory has changed his face - befor ehe dies of his night of torture, and is attacked again by Adams, whom he throws off a balcony to a back entry several floors below, to his death. Beignard sees Adams body, and hides, in time to see Layton step down. Beignard informs Mishra of Gomez' death, while Layton searches for Manega again. Misrah orders his driver not to tell Dolores that her brother has died, as he intends to tell her that in a couple of days that he went to France. Dolores enters the room with a handful of white calla lillies (possibly in preparation to her wedding with Mishra) and her fianc\u00e9 asks her about the man she had come across at the dentist's office. Mishra says that Layton must be killed, and Beignard - looking through a false mirror - tells him that Layton is visiting the fashion house right now.\n\nGIFTS In fact, Layton has escorted Rosario to the ready-made fashion shop, and she is trying a yellow dress under the attentive eyes of a Female Attendant ('Anna Gaylor' (qv)). He keeps adding dresses to his order, and the shop attendants are delighted - as is Dolores, on the other side of the fake mirror. He says he is paying cash, and puts the denture on the accountant's desk. Dolores appears as if by magic in the room, followed shortly by Mishra. After exchanging some words, Layton leaves with Rosario, leaving the denture in Mishra's hands. Their taxi is followed by a car with two of Mishra's men, one in a brown jacket, the other in a blue jacket ('Fred Williams' (qv)).\n\nRESTAURANT Layton takes Rosario to a scenic restaurant, and orders pricy food and drinks. He sees the two men who were tailing him sit at another table, and takes leave from his companion to make a phone call to Malaga. As Layton closes the phone booth door behind him, Marion arrives in front of the door, unhappy to find the phone occupied again. Layton leaves the phone booth, and both lovers are mesmerized to come across each other, again. She seems about to make another scene, but she's forgotten, jumps into his lap, full of joy. Three of the American tourists see them, and join in their happiness. He explains that the woman she had seen him with had tried to abuse him, and he had never seen her before... Marion is a practical girl, asks him if he had had luch already, which he says, \"No...\" and promptly, she drags him by the hand into the adjoining room set to serve lunch to the tour group. The Chef is awfully surprised to see the same man sitting at the veranda with one woman, now inside, ordering a new luch at the tour guide's table. Layton invents a story of an accident, and the insirance company he works for, sending him to Malaga to make the insurance survey. Marion speaks of children, marriage, and Chinese sex, and Layton is only eager to escape to the terrace, and re-join Dolores. He does so, after ordering the wine. He prepares a sandwich for her to take with her, tells her she is in a great danger, and tells her to run away quickly. She does, but first she wants a kiss. As they kiss, Marion is watching them from the bay-window. He gets back to Marion, who is preparing a sandwich for herself, and leaves him at the table, taking her tourists with her. Again he tries to reason with Marion, but she delivers one of her right punches to the jaw, and Layton flies over the handrail, and falls on the floor below, on a bed of shrubs. His jaw hurts, but Layton makes it to a table where Dolores is having a frizzy drink. She shows him a pistol, and orders him to put his hands behind his head. Meanwhile, Marion is commanding her tourists like an army sergeant, conveying them into the bus. But then, Marion sees the two men gagging and grabbing Rosario, and forcing her into a closed van. Marion decides to investigate, hiding between the cars parked in front of the restaurant, and sees Layton taking the driver's place in Dolores' sports car, with yet this other woman at his side.\n\nPRISONER Marion orders the tour bus driver to follow the green sports car, which is following the van taking Rosario prisoner, and the three vehicles go at a considerable speed through a scenic by dangerous mountain road, with plenty of U bends. By stopping the car suddenly in front of Malaga's cathedral, Layton manages to take Dolores' pistol, and reverse the situation... only to impose her to have a whisky with him, and talk things over. Layton drives to Dolores' apartment downtown, stops in a narrow street - thus blocking the passage of the tour bus that was still following them. Marion sees Dolores closing the blinds of the bay window, and mounts the stairs quickly. Just in time to find Layton kissing Dolores, to settle their armistice... Layton prtends to be an associate of Mr. Gomez, and is demanding 10 millions for the two X-rays he pretends to have. While they were discussing, J\u00e9sus comes behind Layton and knocks him out with a truncheon. J\u00e9sus and the two henchmen of Misha drug Layton, and take him to the van, and they go back up the dwindling road, again followed by Dolores, alone in her sports car... Unawares that Marion had got inside the van, and is now making a declaration of love to Layton, deeply asleep. Marion is not perceived, because she had been hiding between rows of clothes inside the van - property of Dolores Arrabal's fashion house. Layton is revived at Misha's \"finca\" (ranch), and he repeats his deal proposition to Mishra. Layton, keeping a conversation tone, tells that Gomez is dead - thus upsetting Dolores who was listening to their dialogue. Dolores runs away from the passageway overlooking a training bull fight arena, angry. Mishra excites a bull for a minute, then asks for Miguel ('Henri Gu\u00e9gan' (qv)) - the man in the brown jacket, who brings him Rosario, her hands tied behind her back. Under the menace of seeing Rosario thrown down to the bull's horns, Layton says where he has hidden the X-rays, and Mishra spares the girl. J\u00e9sus picks the van to go to Torremolinos, as Marion is hiding on top of the van. At the country mansion, Rosario overhears a conversation between Mishra and someone else, and Mishra is receiving orders to kills both Layton and the girl. Marion stood hidden at the \"garage\", but discovers she is in a bulls' stable instead, and screams. Her scream calls the attention of the third henchman, wearing a blue jacket with a little mustach ('Antoine Baud' (qv)), just as Dolores is trying to get out of the house unobserved. The henchman misses her, and Dolores gets to the haystack where Layton is. They discuss his, and her situation: he claims not to be a secret agent, she claims her only crime is to have fallen in love with Mishra.\n\n(79:50) Dolores has untied half of Layton's bonds, when she decides to kiss him - just when Marion had managed to find her way in to the hayloft. Marion charges across the stable like an arena bull, kicks Layton to the chest as he pretended to explain everything to her, and and launches herself into the surprised Dolores, flooring her with a single punch. Both women are in knee length dresses and nylons and high-heel shoes. Layton, who is caught between dodging her fury and further loosening his wrists, can't do much. The scorned woman throws punches on Dolores, who grabs her arms, and they roll on the hay, literally, first one and then the other on top. At one point Marion is kneeling over Dolores, holding her powerfully. This gives Dolores a few seconds respite, needed to stand up and tangle again with Marion. Two villains enter, and Marion leaves Dolores alone, and fist fights with Miguel Dolores starts also to fight Manuel. The women seem to be winning, when Mishra arrives with a third man. Manuel collapses from the after effect of a punch by Dolores.\n\n(81:00) REINFORCEMENTS Dolores tells Mishra that she has told Layton who he is, and he slaps her hard. Shots are heard, and Manuel crashes through the partition wall into the hayloft. Marion attacks the man with mustach, and Layton uses his free legs to disarm Mishra who was holding a pistol. Then, Layton controls another henchman who comes in with a non lit cigarette ('Antoine Baud' (qv)). Enrique Manega enters, with a Luger in hand. Followed by Petula, who jumps down from a window. Petula is dressed in a black trousers and a chequered cap. She addresses Mishra, poiunts a pistol at him, and gives him an order of prison... using the name of Hakim Gregory. Next, Petula goes to Layton, brushing the hay off his coat and caressing his bruised cheek... Marion looks at her in amazement. She, Marion, is his steady lover, after all, not this woman, again! She rushes at Petula, tackles her bodily, and they both tumble onto a pile of hay in a frenzied wrestling. She still manages to punch Layton again. Mishra uses the confusion to hit the plainclothes officer that came in with Petula, and Dolores and Manega fight the two henchmen. Mishra manages to escape from the loft using one of the windows.\n\n(82:10) At the mansion, Beignard always very composed, is taken valuables from a safe into a large hand bag. Mishrah comes in, and adresses the driver respectfully, saying the airplane is ready for their escape. Beignard - revealed as the gang leader - complains that he has not done a good job, as he made the dentist disappear, but not the denture mold, and shoots him point blank. In the hayloft, where a fire has started, the fistfights go on. A henchman is thrown down onto the bulls' stable, arousing the animals. Beignard takes the driver seat of the van, but Logan sees him in time to stop the van driving away by throwing an object with nails onto his path. Beignard loses control of the van, and crashes into the barn. He keeps shooting at Layton, who dodges and hides, finally into a pigsty. When beignard runs out of bullets, they fight hand to hand. Beignard uses a long fork to attack Layton, but eventually the fire damage to the barn's structure forces him to run away. Layton catches up with him at the passegeway overlooking the bull fight arena, and they fight again hand to hand. Eventually, Beignard falls to the arena, presumably to be butchered by the bull.\n\n(86:15) By a KO'ed henchman, Marion and Dolores, all messed up and with faces tarnished by the fire's smut, are sitting and discussing events together, like old friends. In the next division, Petula is dressing up a wound on Rosario's leg.\n\n(86:25) At the Torremolinos hotel, Daniel Layton tries to evade an encounter with Petula, who absolutly wants to meet him to discuss how to bring Hakim Gregory to the French authorities. He tells her he will take care of everything, and jumps out of his room's balcony. When passing the lobby, he is intercepted by Dolores, who had been waiting for him, but he manages to escape her, too. Outside, Rosario was waiting at the car park, but the resourseful Layton manages to start his car and drive away unseen.\n\n(88:45) IN THE BUS Layton passes the frontier back to France. In front of him, the tour bus is returning from its adventurous tour in Spain. The bus uses a large passage to give way to Layton's car, who passes, and stops in front of it. He goes into the bus, to kiss his fiancee, amidst the happy chorus of the old tourists. Then, Layton checks with Miss Parker, on the last row of the bus - the \"lady\" next to her is not chanting, and is in a deep sleep: it's Beignard in women's clothes. Layton exclaims, \"I love Miss Parker!\" Promptly, Marion is about to run to the back of the bus and start another catfight, but she thinks better, and the couple kisses, at... THE END"

    "Carter": "In the midst of a deadly pandemic caused by a virus which makes the infected patients violent and zombie-like, originating from the DMZ that has already devastated the United States (150K infected and 30K dead) and North Korea (8.5 M infected and on the verge of collapse), a man wakes up in a blood-soaked bed in a motel room in Seoul, with a cross-shaped scar on the back of his head. He is intruded upon by armed CIA agents who threaten him to ask the whereabouts of Dr. Jung Byung-ho (Jung Jae-young). Dr Jung and his daughter have been missing for 19 days, as reported on the news, on their way to North Korea. With no recollections of his past, he doesn't know who he is or why he is there, let alone who Dr. Jung is. A female voice inside his ear which only he can hear, tells him that his name is Carter (Joo Won) and he needs to follow her instructions if he wants to live. Following the voice, he escapes the room and enters a public bath where he confronts hundreds who try to kill him but survives thanks to his fighting and killing skills.\n\nInside a van of NIS agents (Strategic agents of North Korea) Choi Yu-Jin (Byeon Seo-Yun), the female voice reveals that she is Han Jung-Hee (Jeong So-Ri) who works for North Korea's Labor Party, which is working with South Korea to create a treatment for the virus. Dr. Jung Byung-ho, who successfully cured his own infected daughter Ha-Na (Kim Bo-Min), leads the project based on an antibody from her. On the way to a lab in North Korea (where North had made large scale preps to produce 100 MM vaccine shots), Ha-Na & Dr Jung went missing and was presumed to have been kidnapped by CIA. North is blaming South for this kidnapping, as a conspiracy to destroy the North's infrastructure.\n\nCarter is tasked with rescuing Ha-Na and bringing her back to North Korean facility where the production of a vaccine is underway. When Carter questions his identity and why he is engaged in this mission, he is told that he is a South Korean (A CIA agent)-born naturalized citizen of North Korea (Carter fell in love with a North Korean woman and married her) who has decided to take part in the mission to save his infected daughter (she is also imprisoned in North Korea). they say, He was the one who commanded to have his memory center blocked. Carter is taken to the building where Ha-Na has been imprisoned. However, CIA agents who approach him claim that he is actually a former CIA agent named Michael Bane who was believed to be dead during a mission in Syria. Jung-Hee allows her signal to be tracked to Carter's molar, and the CIA takes the molar out. Jung-Hee tells Carter that the molar will explode in 5 secs, giving him an opportunity to escape.\n\nThey hide among the crowds in the streets and watch the news that says that Dr. Jung Byung-ho has managed to reach the research facility in North Korea. Agent Agnes (Camilla Belle) approaches Carter and asks him to trust her (she blocks Jung-Hee's signal to Carter), but she is shot. Ha-Na is kidnapped by the CIA and Choi Yu-Jin tries to save her. Choi Yu-Jin is killed, but Carter reaches in time to save Ha-Na. Meanwhile using Agnes's earpiece, Carter knows that CIA has established his identity as Michael Bane and are preparing to kill him. Carter eliminates the entire CIA squad. Jung-Hee guides Carter to an airstrip and onto a plane to North Korea.\n\nThe troubles are not over yet, as the pilots on the plane are given coffee that infects them with the virus. It was the North Korean medic on the plane who was trying to kill Ha-Na and Carter by luring them to the cargo hold. Director Kim is in charge of security on the plane (he is South Korean), and he shoots the medic to save them both. He questions the medic about who created the virus, since it can lead to a coup against the current regime in North Korea. The medic admits that he is working for the CIA, just like Carter. Kim is killed in the shoot-out. The medic triggers an explosive, which rips a hole in the plane. The medic returns to the main area of the plane and tells both the South and North Koreans that Kim was working for the CIA and tried to kill Ha-Na. Before this can be sorted, the infected pilots attack the main area of the plane. The medic uses the confusion to try and escape with a parachute and Ha-Na, but Carter was still in the cargo hold. As the medic jumps, Carter goes after him (without a parachute). He takes Ha-Na and the parachute mid-air and lands safely. On the ground, Carter is again attacked by CIA teams, and Carter has to fight them off. Carter is then attacked by hordes of zombies, whom he shoots, before escaping.\n\nNevertheless, Carter manages to arrive North with Ha-Na, where they meet Han Jung-Hee and her superior North Korean General Kim Jong-Hyeok (Lee Sung-Jae). When he is at the edge of completing his mission and getting his memories back, he and Jung-Hee are betrayed by a North Korean military coup led by General Kim. General Kim refuses to let Carter leave, since the deal was made by the Party and not him. Kim plans to use the virus to destroy South Korea and the US, so he can create a new world order (with the vaccine in his control).\n\nWhile Ha-Na is in the possession of military, General Kim convinces Jung-Hee to join the coup. Carter escapes from Kim's soldiers who try to kill him. Carter follows General Kim and Jung-Hee to a bio-medical facility where Ha-Na is being taken, reuniting with her father Dr. Jung Byung-ho. Carter learns that Jung-Hee is his wife and shoots Kim who threatens Jung-Hee with a gun. At the same facility, they meet their infected daughter Yoon-Hee who behaves violently and transmits the disease to her mother Jung-Hee. Dr. Jung Byung-ho injects Yoon-Hee an antidote which makes her temporary unconscious.\n\nAfter fighting against the infected patients and Kim's soldiers, they escape the facility on a jeep. The five; Carter, Jung-Hee, Yoon-Hee, Dr. Jung and Ha-Na departs to catch a train operated by Chinese government, carrying infected people to Dandong, China. Jung-Hee says that they need to stop the train, else the virus will spread globally. On the way, Jung-Hee and Dr. Jung Byung-ho get Carter's memories back by activating a device back on his head. Carter remembers that he agreed on this mission in exchange of his family's freedom (They had been imprisoned, as North Korea had found that Carter was an undercover CIA spy) and it was he who suggested to block his memories to ensure that he can't betray the North.\n\nAmidst continuous chase and fight with North Korean coup, the Jung-Hee sends Carter, Ha-Na and Yoon-Hee ahead to intercept the train, while she and Dr Jung hold back the troops. Carter boards the train and manages to fight off the North Koreans trying to kill him and take Ha-Na back. General Kim had survived and led the North Korean attack on Carter. Yoon-Hee wakes up, apparently cured from the disease. Jung-Hee and Dr Jung catch up with the train on a truck. Carter kills Kim in his helicopter and joins Jung-Hee on the train with Dr Jung, Ha-Na and Yoon-Hee. As the train is crossing the bridge, the bridge explodes (presumably with the bomb planted by the CIA) making the train head for a fall."

    "Case Closed: Countdown to Heaven": "The Detective Boys are on their way to a camping trip with Agasa. On the way, they get a view of Mt. Fuji, the biggest mountain in Japan, and the newly constructed Nishitamashi Twin Tower Buildings, which are the tallest buildings in Japan. While looking outside, Mitsuhiko tells Agasa if they may pay a visit, and he agrees. They arrive at Auto Campgrounds where they finish eating rice bowls. Genta punishes Mitsuhiko for not finishing his rice, because the gods will punish him.\n\nNighttime comes and everyone is sleeping soundly in their tents except Genta and Haibara. Genta goes to the bathroom, and on the way back, he spots Haibara on the phone. Not suspecting anything, he runs back to the tent shivering. She talks to a mysterious person on the phone leaving her next location as the Twin Tower Buildings, and saying \"he'll be there\". Still nighttime, Gin and Vodka are seen in the Porsche 356A talking presumably to Haibara or perhaps listening in on her calls. They'll also be at the Nishitamashi towers.\n\nOn their way, Genta complains on not fitting in the back seat, forgetting he ate five bowls of rice for breakfast. Mitsuhiko decides to try and play the 30 seconds game. You count without looking at the timer, and whoever is closest to the time wins. Haibara and Agasa aren't going to play. Mitsuhiko goes first getting a time of 40 seconds, Conan gets closer with a time of 27 seconds, Genta counts 59 seconds, and Ayumi gets the perfect score of 30 seconds. Genta asks Haibara who she was talking to on the phone, and she replies he was dreaming. They finally come to the Nishitamashi Twin Tower Buildings, and not shortly after, Ran, Kogoro, and Sonoko arrive by taxi. Surprised, they decide to join each other as Kogoro's old friend from college, Mio Tokiwa, who owns the building. He was invited a week before the opening. Mio Tokiwa's secretary named Chinami Sawaguchi comes outside and greets them to take a quick tour of the building. She explains that all floors above 31st belong to the Tokiwa Corporation, and the showroom spans from the 2nd to the 3rd floor. Mitsuhiko explains to Ayumi that the Tokiwa Company deals with computer software, but are involved with everything concerning computers. At the game room, they meet the Tokiwa executive named Yoshiaki Hara, also a lead programmer who created a particular machine that can show the face of a person in ten years. Ayumi and Agasa take the first try. Agasa didn't change one bit, while Ayumi's photo looks beautiful. Genta and Mitsuhiko take the next seat as they turn into high-schoolers. Sonoko and Ran are next. Sonoko looks old, while Ran looks a bit like her mother Eri. Mitsuhiko and Ayumi look curious to Ran and Conan's reaction.\n\nConan and Haibara refuse to participate but Kogoro forces Conan inside, and Genta and Mistuhiko force Haibara into the seat. After the flash happens, the machines receives an error which save those two from being discovered of their true identities. Sawaguchi received a call to inform them that the party rooms open on the 75th floor. Sawaguchi accidentally steps on Kogoro's shoes, and Hara comments on her clumsiness due to her birth on the year of the boar. They take the VIP elevator which goes to any floor of the building. Sawaguchi points out that the only other way to access the VIP elevator is by the Concert Hall on the 66th floor. Ayumi and Mitsuhiko are amazed and describe the feeling as rising to heaven. They finally reach the 75th floor and find the room a mess in order to prepare for the Opening Party. They meet Tokiwa near the stage and introduce themselves. Tokiwa presents the Japanese artist named Hosui Kisaragi, Nishitamashi councilman named Iwamatsu Oki, and the architect of the building named Hidehiko Kazama who introduced himself as a former student of Teiji Moriya. This instantly brings anxiety to Kogoro and Conan but he reassures them that he has no intention to destroy the buildings like him. Conan points out that the building are asymmetrical. From the window they get a perfect view of Mt. Fuji. On the other side of that window is the B tower which is a commercial building on the bottom while the top is a hotel. The top floor also has an indoor pool, with a retractable roof. With Oki being drunk at the time he speaks with Tokiwa about staying at the hotel for weekend. And although it isn't open, she prepares a suite on the 67th floor for him. Oki then proceeds to ask her to dinner before commenting on her brooch, which she got herself as a gift. Hosui abruptly ends the conversation and leaves without escort. Hidehiko tells Kogoro that Hosui's behavior is due to Mio's treatment of his art. She buys them and sells them for a higher profit. Hara takes out chocolates and give some to Ayumi, Genta, and Mitsuhiko. He invites them to his house to test out a new game he's created next Sunday. Haibara walks off, and Mitsuhiko tells Ran that he wishes to speak with her. Ayumi close behind tells Ran the same thing. Sonoko is seen staring at her picture while Haibara walks by, Sonoko decides whether to get a perm or not. Two employees come up to the VIP elevator and talk about how a nice car pulled up. The other employee says it's Porsche 356A which catches Conan's attention. Conan asks for the cars detail which matches that of Gin's car. He quickly runs into the elevator looking down briefly, and sees the Porsche drive off as he approaches the entrance. The next day at a fast food restaurant Mitsuhiko talks to Ran in private about his crush on Ayumi. He likes her but she likes Conan. Mitsuhiko also has started to like Haibara. Although confused if he's a bad person for liking two people Ran tells him he shouldn't be ashamed of it. She says to value and treasure those feelings and to stay friends with them, whether it be Haibara or Ayumi. At a do-nut shop Ayumi talks to Ran about her crush on Conan. She also mentions his crush on Ran. She doesn't believe that, but Ayumi tells her it's \"women's intuition\". Ran talks with Conan using his bow tie to disguise himself as Shinichi. Ran tells him that Conan has a crush on her. Shinichi tells her it's nothing to worry about.\n\nAt the Nishitamashi Buildings, B tower 67th floor, an unknown killer prepares to attack Oki. The killer charges and stabs him to death backing him to a closet.\n\nNext day at police headquarters, Inspector Megure gathers all the visitors to talk about Oki's death. Chiba reports the time of death was around 10 to midnight, and that a sake cup broken in two pieces were found at the scene. Megure has two possibilities for the sake cup. Either Oki carried it with him and and it fell, or it had a symbolic message to it. On the police board list of suspects, five suspects are put together. Shiratori says that the building isn't open to the public yet making entry impossible, leaving only Tokiwa, Hara, Kisaragi, Sawaguchi, and Kazama as the only people left. Kogoro comes up with a possible meaning of the broken sake cup. Choko (sake cup) refers to chocolate, and the one who likes chocolate is Hara. Megure points out that Hara is the only person to have an alibi. Although they're still investigating the motive, Oki was a councilman with as much power as the mayor. The city initially wouldn't allow the Twin Buildings to be built but Oki overturned the decision. Conan figures it might be Tokiwa, as her brooch looks like the broken sake cup. Although Kogoro denies the possibility, Megure objects and suggests she is the primary suspect. She was staying at B Towers 68th floor, making her closest to the victim. Sonoko said the sake cup resembles the bowl used in Japanese painting, which was used for mixing powder. Taking in those factors puts everyone except Kazama, and Sawaguchi as suspects. Conan points out his past worry that Kazama was a former student of Teiji Moriya. Although Shiratori convinces him that he's more of a technical architect and didn't have a need for perfection like Moriya. Megure brings up evidence against Sawaguchi. Her father was an investigative journalist who passed away due to exhaustion before she graduated from college. Although there is no evidence against her father and Oki. While Megure is talking Conan takes Iwamatsu's picture from a book. He notices that blood is missing in a place where there should be. He associates the sake cup with alcohol which points to the organization, but Ai says that the message is too obvious to be them. Across the table he sees Ayumi, Genta, and Mitsuhiko agreeing on something suspiciously. At Beika Station they meet up hoping to get ahead of Conan on the case, but Conan comes from behind and surprises them, making them promise never to do it again. They take the train to see Kazama, and tomorrow Hara. They've also found out that Hosui lives alone in a house he built in Asahino three years ago. They've invited Ai, but she decided not to join as she is doing some cleaning. (At the next scene Ai is watching an old gang movie which mirrors the life she lives today.) The Detective Boys finally arrive at Asahino station, and meet up with Kazama. On entering his home Conan compliments him on his CAD system completely designed for designing buildings and models. Mitsuhiko starts asking a series of questions on Oki's death. Kazama says he had no disputes nor any disagreements with Oki, and even thanked him for his job. Kazama then proceeds to talk about his son whom he calls even knowing he's sleeping. His calm attitude, and presence tells Conan he's not the killer. Next they visit the Kisaragi Residence. Kisaragi is seen kneeling and painting Mt. Fuji, but oddly enough his shades are down not allowing him a view of the mountain. Kisaragi yells at them, but quickly subsides, and as they leave he leaves them a crude outline portrait of themselves. At Agasa's house, Professor Agasa is awoken the the sound of his snoring. He gets up and realizes that Haibara is talking to someone. He calls Conan and mentions that Genta also saw the same thing during the camping trip. Although Agasa fears the Black Organization might be on to her, Conan puts his belief in her. He meets up with the Detective Boys to go and visit Hara. As they arrive Conan notices his doors are partially open. On entry, they see his dead body laying on the floor.\n\nConan spots a single shot wound to the chest, a knife with chocolate cake on it, and a broken sake cup. The police arrive and Takagi questions the meaning of the sake cup. Shiratori explains that because of the cup, they know it's the same criminal, which means he's now turned into a serial killer. Conan speaks with Crime Scene Investigator Tome who on inspection of the cup notices that the broken fragments have no blood stains on it.\n\nAt the Mouri Detective Agency, Shiratori and Megure, speculate the time of death between 5 and 6 at night. Hara's computer data was also completely erased. Now the prime suspects are Tokiwa, Kazama, Sawaguchi, and Kisaragi. Megure also tried to postpone the opening party, but Tokiwa refused leaving two tickets with invitations on it for them. A Porsche arrives at a building and Gin steps out, enters the building, and we find Vodka ruffling through Akemi's apartment which she leased in secret for one year. Vodka brings up a computer which Gin will use to run a tracing program, to track down Haibara's location. Haibara gets out of her bed and calls the room to leave a message, doing so she leaves her next location. Just three seconds before the trace is completed Conan cuts the line, explaining the danger of her actions. She runs upstairs in tears. The call comes again but it was only to remotely delete the message so no one would hear it. At Teitan Elementary School, Haibara apologizes for herself. She agrees it's a dangerous thing to do, but it calms her down to hear her sister's voice even if it's for ten seconds. The Detective Boys reassure her she's not alone anymore. Nighttime at the Twin Tower Buildings come. At the Central surveillance Room - Basement Level 1 a metallic ball is seen rolled into the room which immediately knocks out the guards monitoring the screens. The culprits are seen planting a bomb in the Main Computer Room, the entrance, and the rooftop of the building. At the Mouri Detective Agency, they're preparing to leave, but are waiting for Sonoko to arrive. Conan asks if Hara might be connected to the Black Organization somehow, Haibara responds that it certainly possible as they're always recruiting people from different fields to meet the demands in research and operations.\n\nSonoko finally arrives, and with a perm like Haibara. Takagi, Chibi, Megure, and Shiratori are seen stationed outside of the buildings because Tokiwa refused their presence, and are left to observe. At the party, the kids see the red Mustang which they believe was disassembled, but as Ayumi pointed out it was loaded onto the cargo elevator. As they enjoy the sunset, Sonoko makes fun of Ran for being in love with Shinichi. Mio walks up on stage, and presents a game she learned from her father Kaneari Tokiwa called the 30-seconds game. Whoever comes the closest or exactly leaves with the mustang convertible as a present. If there is a tie, then it will be settled with janken (rock, paper, scissors). The loser receives a mountain bike and helmet. Everyone but Conan an Haibara give up their watches and start the game. Kisaragi didn't participate either. The game begins and the winner quickly becomes Kogoro by pure luck.\n\nSawaguchi starts to gather up people who helped build the Twins. The lights turn off and the exhibit begins. The announcer presents the many works of Kisaragi throughout his career as an artist. But when the show is over Kisaragi's greatest painting is yet to be revealed. When the lights turn off and it is shown, Mio Tokiwa's corpse hangs on a wire dangling in front of the painting.\n\nAs Kogoro brings down the body to inspect the damage, a sake cup shows on the floor, this time however, unbroken. Curtains are hung over and Megures team goes up to check the crime scene. Tokiwa's body was attached to a piano wire hook, so as the painting lowered the body rose asphyxiating her. They recreate the crime scene with the lights on the floors as marks for their position. Kogoro accuses Kisaragi for the murder, as his works were being sold at high prices and she was making the profits. Takagi however, believes it is unlikely since he didn't know anything about the other sake cups. Kogoro again makes an unreasonable deduction. This time Sawaguchi is accused, only for her father's ambitions, and protest against politicians. He believed Oki was taking bribes to persuade the council to allow the project. The only proof he presents is that the kanji for choko is boar and kuchi, since she was born on the year of the boar once you rearrange the kanji you get choko. Conan interrupts, but is quickly thrown off backstage where Haibara is waiting patiently. She gives Conan a clue as to how the killer pulled off the trick. If Tokiwa hadn't been drinking, she would've realized someone had attached a wire to her necklace. He finds a pearl where Kisaragi was. He quickly runs downstairs to confirm his suspicion for the motive.\n\nAt Basement Level 4 - Power Generator Room one of the bombs the killers used has shut down all the lights in A tower. The second bomb quickly goes off in the Computer Room and eradicated all of Tokiwa Corporations Data.\n\nThrough quick thinking they figure out that the VIP elevators run on an independent power source, and all women and children are to take the elevators directly to the outside, while the men take the emergency stairs, go across the Sky Bridge and descend down B tower. The firefighters come and formulate a plan to put out the fires. The evacuation plan starts and Conan almost fits in the elevator but the weight restrictions limit him. The Detective Boys decide to get off on the 66th floor because of a women and her baby, and get stuck in the process. Conan figures that the planning and destruction of the building was too precise to be anyone else but the Organization, including the destruction of the computer room. Finally Conan, Ran, and Sonoko's opportunity arrive and they take the elevator. While descending he figures out that because of the messages left by Miyano, they believe she's in the elevator, and Sonoko is the target thanks to her new hairdo. He uses his glasses to zoom in across B-Tower's roof and sees Gin with a sniper pointing directly at her.\n\nConan tricks Sonoko into moving out the way. Thanks to her unusual behavior at the sight of danger, Gin realizes that Sonoko isn't Haibara.\n\nConan uses the hatch to escape, and Ran opens the door to the 45th floor. As a fire approaches he quickly leads them to the sky bridge. Gin and Vodka trap Haibara believing she is with one of the men. When she doesn't show they decide to blow the sky bridges so she has no way of escaping. As The Detective Boys head out to the Sky Bridge on the 60th floor Vodka blows it off and it collides with the Sky Bridge on the 45th floor, trapping Conan and Ran as well. Smoke penetrates the door nearby and they start to feel it's effects. Ran opens up a hatch where a fire hose is kept, ties it around Conan and herself, jumps down and uses the force to break the glass just as the hose burned from the consuming fire. As they reach the police on the parking lot it is just then that Conan realizes that the Detective Boys are stuck on the 60th floor. Megure immediately calls for a helicopter. Conan takes the skateboard from the car and takes the B-tower elevator to the 60th floor, and uses it to jump across the sky bridge to lead the Detective Boys to the roof. On the 75 floor he splits up with the group and decides to head for the killer's location.\n\nIn order to murder Tokiwa, the killer gave a pearl necklace as present to her. He requested she wear the necklace to compliment the painting he donated. The killer is revealed to be Hosui Kisaragi. He gave Tokiwa a necklace that was easily removable. While backstage he hooked a wire from the top of his painting of Mt. Fuji along the top of the curtain to his identical necklace. While waiting to be presented he undid her necklace and pretended to pick it up. He put his identical one around her neck and all he had to do was wait. He placed the sake cup on the stage to make sure it was seen as the serial killer's doing. His only alibi was that Hara was already dead when Kisaragi got there which explains the fragments of the sake cup which had no blood on it. Oki's murder was also strange. Kisaragi gave him a painting to hang on his closet, unaware of his true intention, which explains the unusual blood stains on the closet's door. Kisaragi of course denies the possibility and demands for proof. Conan told him of his canes sound before and after the show. That explains where he put the original necklace. The motive he explains is the towers presence. For the past 10 years, he climbed a small hill just outside of Nishitamashi for his paintings. When his age started catching up, he built a house on the hill and decided to devote his remaining years painting Mt. Fuji. From that place he had the best view point, but the tower split Fuji in twain. This is the broken sake cups meaning. Although Tokiwa's case had a cup it wasn't broken. This was due to the cup already establishing that a serial killer is responsible. As Kisaragi agreed to his fate he took a bottle of poison from his pocket and as he was about to drink it, Conan used his watch to tranquilize him. Conan explained to Haibara that when he arrived in Asahino Station, he noticed the towers splitting Fuji in two, along with Kisaragi's unusual curtains. He also explains Hara's killer. He was holding a silver knife in his hand not to protect himself but to leave a message. Silver meaning GIN in Japanese. Gin likely believed the knife was picked up for self-defense. He deduced that Hara accessed secret data from the Black Organizations computers, which explains his computers erased data. As Conan heads upstairs Haibara sits down and at the counter sees a glowing red light behind the alcohol reasoning it's a bomb. When Conan heads to the roof Vodka activates a bomb there to ensure every ones death. When they arrive downstairs, Haibara shows Conan that there's a bomb under every table. As they look outside the window Conan sees the closed dome on B-Tower and believes the car can go across the building. Haibara denies that as the distance between the building is 50 meters, and would require at least 60 meters to go over. With the height calculated it will take 2 seconds to make impact, and 108 km/h. Although Conan agrees he wants to use the explosion as an accelerator. Conan realizes that this plan requires precise timing, but his watch died, so they prepare Ayumi to count 30 seconds, as they go. Haibara decides to count to 30 to remain precise. He call Megure and request the roof be opened. They load Kisaragi who's still unconconscious into the car (a Ford Mustang convertible) and start the countdown from one minute. But as the 30 second time approaches Haibara remains in the chair, so Genta takes her with 5 seconds left and goes into the Ford Mustang convertible. The bomb goes off and as they fly through the air Haibara almost drops from the car, but Mitsuhiko saves her. Adding that to the calculation he realizes that the glass formation inside the dome will kill Haibara, so he takes the biker helmet from Ayumi and uses the power shoes to break them just enough so that she'll get by. When they land, Vodka gets the news that five kids and an old man escape with the car, and finally think that Haibara isn't there. Gin said it's okay as their objective is complete. Destroying the main computer room in the towers was their intention. Back in the dome, Ayumi explains that when she's close to Conan she counted her heartbeat as a second. After they arrest Kisaragi, Kogoro realizes his prize car is destroyed."

    "Casino Royale": "Casino Royale (1967)\n\nSir James Bond (David Niven) retired at the height of his powers when forced to betray his lover Mata Hari, and now lives in an English country house, surrounded by lions, devoting himself to Debussy and cultivating black roses, attended by his butler (Erik Chitty). However, alarmed by the mounting losses of their spies, he is visited by the heads of the British ('M' or McTarry; John Huston), French (LeGrand; Charles Boyer), American (Ransome; William Holden) and Russian (Smernov; Kurt Kasznar) Secret Services (collectively driven by M's chauffer John LeMesurier), who petition him to return. He refuses, considering himself to belong to a nobler tradition, and them all gadget-ridden \"jokeshop\" spies, and deploring the handing on of his legend, name and number to a \"sexual acrobat\". Even a letter from the Queen does not sway him, and as a final desperate trick M signals for Sir James' home to be blown up by the Army: the attack also kills M (but not, apparently, the others).\n\nSmersh Authority (the villains) learns that \"Sir James Bond is back, with his morals, his vows and his celibate image. We must destroy that image\".\n\nSir James, thus forced out of retirement, travels to Scotland, taking M's toupee (the only surviving relic or heirloom) to M's widow, Lady Fiona, who has been substituted by Smersh agent Mimi (Deborah Kerr). She explains the rituals surrounding the death of The McTarry, which include a banquet (with fresh goat haggis and lots of whisky), dancing, and a memorial grouse shoot (\"Whenever a McTarry dies, the grouse come into season\"). The castle is filled with beautiful girls, agents of Smersh, pretending to be M's eleven 16-19-year-old daughters (\"some of us are adopted\") including Heather (Tracey Crisp) and Meg (Alexandra Bastedo), who undress Sir James for his bath (\"be careful, that's my loose kneecap\"), Buttercup (\"Daddy's little thermometer\", Angela Scoular) whom Sir James discovers actually in his bath, as well as Eliza (Gabriella Licudi), Peg (Elaine Taylor), and Michele (Frances Cosslett).\n\nSir James drinks all the others under the table at the banquet, but when later approached by Mimi in his bedroom claiming he \"comfort her\" as her \"widow's due\", upon rejecting her, she calls him a \"ninnogaywillycouf\" and summons the pipers for a 'worzle', a contest which involves picking up and attempting to throw large stone cannonballs. This he wins, largely as the five pipers (Robin, Jock, Sandy: Bob Godfrey, Percy Herbert) injure themselves in trying to pick up the balls, whereas he manages to pick one up, throw it and catch it. Mimi is so impressed the other girls decide she is a risk and lock her in her room.\n\nAt the grouse shoot, one of Sir James' cape buttons has been substituted with a homing beacon, and the girls send rocket-launched explosive-laden dummy grouse towards him. Assisted by Mimi, who has escaped down the rather unsafe drainpipe from her room, Sir James uses his braces to fire the button back into the rocket launcher, blowing it up. Mimi, injured, wins a farewell kiss from Sir James (\"Madam, are you quite sure you're dying?\") before entering a convent, and tells him that their orders came from \"Authority: International Mothers' Help, East Berlin\" (1).\n\nDriving back from Scotland, Sir James is trailed by a remote-controlled booby-trapped milk float (control girl Penny Riley), but manages to escape so that it kills yet another Smersh agent (). In London, he takes over as head of the British Secret Service, whose only surviving members are his secretary Miss Moneypenny (or rather her daughter; Barbara Bouchet), and his assistant Hadley (or rather his son; Derek Nimmo), who explain that all the secret agents apart from Sir James' replacement (now doing television) have been killed in sexually suggestive situations (\"stabbed to death in a ladies sauna bath\", \"burnt in a blazing bordello\", \"garrotted in a geisha house\", etc.) with the possible exception of Sir James' nephew, Jimmy Bond (Woody Allen), last seen in the Caribbean escaping a firing squad (\"I have a very low threshold of death\") with an exploding cigarette, only to end up in front of another firing squad. Sir James decides to call up all the auxiliary staff, and to create the ultimate 'Anti-Female Spy Device' - a man whom all women desire, but who is indifferent to them. Miss Moneypenny is tasked with finding one such (\"your mother did some of her best work at night\"), and she finds Cooper ('Coop': Terence Cooper: \"Sounds like something for keeping birds.\" \"That's me\"). Coop, a holder of the 'Kama Sutra Black Belt', is then sent for his anti-female training, against a gym-full of a variety of exotic, exotically dressed Bond girls (Yvonne Marsh, Veronica Gardnier - there are over 200 beautiful girls in the film), overcoming them all but eventually meeting new secret weapon The Detainer (Daliah Lavi), who also becomes 007 (\"I don't do anything, but, unless you're one of them, you do\"), Sir James having decided that to create confusion all agents, both male and female, will become 'James Bond, 007'.\n\nSir James personally recruits two new 007 spies. The first is wealthy Vesper Lynd (Ursula Andress: assistant Valentine Dyall), who Sir James persuades using a \u00a35m tax arrears demand (2). Vesper is given the task of approaching and recruiting Evelyn Tremble (Peter Sellers: \"Isn't Evelyn a girl's name? No, its mine\"), an expert in baccarat at the Buckingham Club, whom Sir James wants to use to defeat Smersh's treasurer, Le Chiffre (Orson Welles), currently gambling with Smersh's money at Casino Royale. She does this, seducing Tremble at her Mayfair flat (to which she has lately had Nelson's Column removed) and also encouraging him to dress up in a number of costumes (including Napoleon - complete with 'Sunny Elba' pamphlet - Hitler and Toulouse-Lautrec: \"Come on, you have more to do\". \"More?!\"). Tremble, now also James Bond, 007, goes to Q (Geoffrey Bayldon) and his fey assistant Fordyce (John Wells) in their cellars full of inept inventions (where he is also shadowed by a dwarf dressed as a garden gnome \"He's our security man\") for his fitting with a gadget-filled suit (\"a little bit tight about the...\" \"Poison capsule compartment?\").\n\nSir James then recruits his own daughter by Mata Hari, Mata Bond (Joanna Pettet), currently working as a living Eastern goddess (\"Celestial Virgin of the Sacred Altar\" \"Figuratively speaking, of course\": temple guard Milton Reid, monk John Hollis): there is a superb temple dance sequence. Mata Bond is sent to West Berlin by London taxicab (taxicab driver Bernard Cribbins) to infiltrate International Mothers' Help, known to be a Smersh cover for the Mata Hari School of Dancing, a spy training school, with rather complex neo-Cubist d\u00e9cor, presided over by the formidable Frau Hoffner (Anna Quale) and the diminutive Polo (Ronnie Corbett). Revealing her identity as Mata Hari's daughter, she is shown by Polo to her mother's old room (\"What an enormous bed!\" \"The German army was very large in those days\"), where she discovers a secret passageway activated by the cistern, which leads to a projection suite: she also discovers 'little Otto' one of her mother's lovers (\"Is he dead?\" \"Hard to tell. He always looked like that\"). She learns that Le Chiffre is, via his agent (Vladek Sheybal) auctioning his art collection of blackmail photographs to raise money: the auction in the auditorium is attended by officers from the British (Jack Gwilliam, Richard Wattis), Chinese (Burt Kwouk), American (Hal Galili) and Russian armies. Warned by the taxi-driver (revealed as Carlton-Towers of the Foreign Office) to prevent Le Chiffre raising the money, as the bidding for the first lot escalates (\"Seventy million tons of rice!\" \"Sixty tons of caviar!\"), Mata returns to the projection room, seizes the case of projector slides and flushes them away: she then escapes Polo by unplugging his external heart battery, Frau Hoffner is shot by Otto, and Mata, using a foam fire-extinguisher on the assorted military, makes good her escape with Carlton-Towers (first trying a drain, but on hearing 'What's New, Pussycat', by taxi back to London). Le Chiffre's agent, telephoning him to report his failure, and that Smersh's leader Dr. Noah now knows what Le Chiffre has been up to, is blown up in his telephone box (the explosion also destroys part of the Berlin Wall).\n\nTremble now travels to Casino Royale, where after meeting Matthis, a French inspector of police (with an improbable Scots accent; Duncan Macrae (3)) , and having a car-wash with many eavesdroppers (yet more beautiful girls), in his room meets Miss Goodthighs (Jacqueline Bisset) \"the management of the Hotel Tropical present their compliments\" who attempts to drug him with doped champagne. Vesper arrives, 'takes care of' Miss Goodthighs, and rouses Tremble.\n\nVesper and Tremble go the Casino: they deposit \u00a3100,000 (cashier Graham Stark) and then meet the casino director Slimmington-Jones (Colin Gordon) in his office. Tremble spots that Le Chiffre is using infra-red spectacles to cheat: Vesper steals these: Le Chiffre shows off with some magic (assistants Jennifer Baker, Susan Baker), and then Tremble and Le Chiffre play a very-high-stakes baccarat game (50 million francs: ~\u00a33.6m or $10m at the time), which Tremble ultimately wins. Tremble takes his winnings as a cheque drawn on a Swiss bank.\n\nOn the way out of the Casino, Vesper is kidnapped: Tremble, advised of this by the doorman (John Bluthal) follows in a racing car (the racing car driver Sterling Moss, as himself, having run off) but is also captured by Le Chiffre, who wants the cheque. Placed in a very elaborate but broken chair in Le Chiffre's dungeon, he suffers torture - not physical, but mental - eventually becoming a Scot in full Highland costume attacked by four Scots marching bands (including Peter O'Toole), he is rescued by Vesper using a machine gun disguised as bagpipes, who then, however, betrays and kills him (and presumably takes the cheque: \"Never trust a rich spy'). Le Chiffre is then killed by Smersh agents sent by Dr. Noah.\n\nBack in London, Sir James goes to see the Prime Minister, leaving Mata to sight-see (\"Mummy would have taken me in\" \"Mummy took everyone in\"): she is captured by a Household Cavalry officer () on horseback and taken by flying saucer, which lands on the now-vacated site of Nelson's Column, to Casino Royale, where, it is now revealed, the secret headquarters of Smersh's leader Dr. Noah are located (announcer Valentine Dyall). Advised of this by former agent Mimi, now a nun collecting donations (\"This department has always been very helpful to needy girls\") Sir James and Moneypenny follow to Casino Royale: attacked in the casino director's room (which is a lift connecting to Dr. Noah's HQ, activated by pushing the eye of a stuffed tiger) they eventually win through to an audience hall with chairs made of gold ingots to see Dr. Noah himself - who turns out to be Sir James' missing nephew, Jimmy Bond. Jimmy is however speechless in his uncle's presence: \"I never should have let Nellie send him to progressive school... I'm beginning to think you're a trifle neurotic\". Dr. Noah/Jimmy reveals part of his plans (using a taped message); to release a bacillus which will leave all women beautiful and all men shorter than himself; and then hits a gong to summon his staff and have Sir James and Moneypenny incarcerated.\n\nDr. Noah then reveals to The Detainer, whom he has also captured, stripped and strapped down to a couch (\"I learnt that in the Boy Scouts\"), his desire to outshine his uncle, and the rest of his plans: to substitute robot doubles for all world leaders (some of which he has already done). He also shows her a pill he has invented, which \"looks like an aspirin, it tastes like an aspirin, but it is not an aspirin\" - it is in fact an atomic bomb, which goes off after 400 chain reactions. Feigning interest in him, she is released, steals the pill, and manages to slip it into his champagne, and he starts his hiccup-visualized countdown.\n\nSir James, Mata, Moneypenny and Coop (captured earlier) now manage to escape the psychedelically-decorated room in which they have been imprisoned (using exploding 'vaporized lysergic acid' (4)), and making their way back to the audience hall (\"Super place for a coming-out party\") and meeting up with The Detainer, find their way back to the Casino (with the aid of Frankenstein's monster: David Prowse). Whilst The Detainer escapes, Sir James tries to call London for aid, but is stopped by Vesper; \"Dear Vesper. The things you do for money\": who has, however, apparently fallen in love with him, and everything that has happened has been a plan to lure him to her at Casino Royale. He overpowers her, and then he and the remaining James Bonds initiate an attack on the Smersh agents in the Casino, aided by the French (Jean-Paul Belmondo: translates 'Merde!' as 'Ouch') and the Americans, both horse-riding Cowboys and tomahawk-wielding Red Indians (air-dropped with tepees as parachutes: Ransome reappears also): George Raft (as himself) shots himself during the affray, and the Keystone Cops have a cameo. Dr. Noah appears with the final chain-reaction countdown hiccups, and the Casino is explosively completely destroyed, killing all five remaining James Bonds (Sir James, Coop, Vesper, Mata, Moneypenny), as well as Dr. Noah/Jimmy Bond. The closing song explains that six James Bonds (including Tremble) go to \"a heavenly spot\", Jimmy to \"a place where it's terribly hot\").\n\nNotes: (1) For younger readers: During the Cold War, the city of Berlin was divided by the Berlin Wall (1961-1989) into West Berlin (under Allied control: the Wall surrounded this) and East Berlin (under Soviet control). One of the motifs of the film is that the International Mothers' Help building straddles the border, this being reflected in the interior d\u00e9cor and lighting, and a symbolic rope bisecting the auditorium. (2) In 1967, \u00a35m was half of art auctioneers Christie's annual turnover. Nowadays (2009) it buys 10% of a Titian. (3) There is also a brief pre-credits scene where Tremble (as James Bond) and the Inspector meet in a pissoir (4) Lysergic acid is a precursor for lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD - very Sixties). As its melting point is 240oC, and its (theoretical) vaporization point considerably higher (it degrades), a certain technical liberty is taken by considering it to be an explosive vapour collectable in a seat-cushion-cover in the film\n\n\n\n(Original version retained below - fades a bit to the end)\n\nAny movie directed by 5 different people is bound to be confusing. This is, off course, no exception.\n\nThe movie starts off with James Bond (Evelyn Tremble (Peter Sellers)) meeting Lieutenant Mathis (Duncan Macrae) of the Special Police in a pissouir in Paris. After Bond checks Mathis' credentials, he follows him out.\n\nThe credits roll.\n\n4 cars come in from different directions - a Citroen, a Cadilac, a Bently, and what appears to be something Russian. The 4 chaufers wait by their cars as the 4 passengers get into a Rolls Royce, driven by a fifth chaufer.\n\nThrough conversations between M (McTarry (John Huston)), Ransome (William Holden), Le Grand (Charles Boyer), and Smernov (Kurt Kasznar), we learn that this is the home of the original James Bond. He is pure of mind and body. They property is protected by many lions.\n\nJames is exercising as the gentlemen arrive. He has a stutter. He complains that the agent that replaced him as James Bond 007 is leaving a trail of dead women behind; that the new gadgets have taken the honour from the profession.\n\nHe takes them outside to show them his black rose. Each spy head complains that they are losing agents at an alarming rate. They want James to come out of retirement to fix their shared problems.\n\nJames interrupts them to play some Debussy. We learn that Bond retired because he had to lure his lover, Mata Hari, to her death. He returns from playing. M shows him a letter from the Queen. Still, he refuses the request to return to duty. M lights a cigar as a signal, and British troops bomb the property. His mansion is destroyed and M's toupee is blown off.\n\nCut to a Smersh control room. We hear the head of Smersh (Authority) tell them that James Bond is back, with his morals, vows, and celebate image in tact. He tells them to initiate Plan B to attempt to destroy that image.\n\nWe see James driving his Morgan (?) through the British countryside into Scotland. Various spys report his progress. We learn that he is heading for M's (McTarry's) castle. Plan B is in operation with Agent Mimi taking the place of M's widow (Lady Fiona) because she has the best Scot's accent.\n\nSir James presents the remains of M to Lady Fiona (Deborah Kerr). They explain that they'd heard of the death from the Grey Piper. The room is full of women, mourning. They prepare a traditional hagis feast for midnight, where they will dance the traditional Scotish Fling and drink Ouskabar. It is explained (there's a lot of explaining going on, but it really doesn't help) that they drink until they drop in their tracks, then after an hour's rest, the piper awakes them for the morning grouse shoot.\n\nJames is shown to his room, where Meg and Heather help him undress for his bath. The room is full of paintings of nude women. Meg and Heather tell him that they are 2 of M's 11 daughters - all between the ages of 16 and 19. As they walk down the hall to the bath, they walk past a series of bedrooms, each with a gorgeous girl peering out.\n\nJames goes into the bath room and starts to undress, when he notices that 17 year old Buttercup is in the tub - testing the water temperature (\"Daddy's little thermometer\"). She invites him in to scrub his back. James has to turn on the cold water to avoid certain embarassment.\n\nCut to James' room, where we see Meg and Heather swapping a button on his coat - but they are speaking French! We learn that the button is to be used only as a last resort - that Mimi's never failed before.\n\nAt the hagis feast, everyone is drinking scotch. Two girls have their legs entwined with James at the table, as he listens to Mimi pass on some of the McTarry folklore. Everyone eventually passes out except James, who takes his cup and the scotch decanter up to his room.\n\nHe's enjoying a nightcap as Mimi comes in and declares \"her Widow's Due\", insisting that James \"doodle her\". He refuses, so she insists that he \"pay the piper\". She blows a silly trumpet solo on a hunting horn, and calls the huge Scottish pipers in. They are going to \"wassle\" - play catch with heavy stone cannon balls.\n\nThe first 5 do themselves in trying to lift and throw the balls. The sixth manages a throw that James catches and throws back. The piper catches the ball, but the weight forces him back, into an armour display, which falls on him and knocks him out. James then picks up the last wassle ball and karate chops it in 2. Mimi is stricken. She praises him in French, blowing her cover. The other girls realize, and lock Mimi in her room.\n\nThe next morning, James is out for the grouse shoot. Mimi's locked in her room, and realizes that James is in trouble. The truck that brought the beaters is actually a launcher of exploding grouse. Mimi escapes by sliding down a drainpipe outside her window, and come to warn James that the button on his coat is actually a homing device. He shoots the grouse before they can get too close, and tells Mimi to take off his braces. They use them like a slingshot to fire the button back towards the beaters. The beaters use a garter belt to fling the homing button back. James grabs the return shot, and Mimi is able to fire it into the grouse launcher. Mimi is injured, and commits herself to a nunnery. She tells James that they are run by International Mother's Help in Berlin.\n\nJames leaves the McTarry estate, but is followed by a woman driving an E-Type Jaguar. The women in the Smersh control room activate a rigged milk truck. Through some tricky driving, James gets in front of the Jag, and the milk truck loses its visual feed to Control. Control has to set the truck to automatic. James drives into his gated estate and gets the gate closed as the Jag spins into them. The milk truck plows into the Jag, and they both explode.\n\nJames shows up at MI5, sees Moneypenny, and gives her a big kiss. Moneypenny enjoys it, but explains that she is actually Moneypenny's daughter. James is on a mission, and has lost his stammer. He meets Hadley, who is also the son of the original Hadley.\n\nHadley goes over the state of MI5's agents. Most have been lured to their death by enemy women agents. The replacement James Bond has quit to \"do television\". James' nephew, Jimmy Bond was working as a spy in the Caribbean, but hasn't been heard from in a while. In a flashback, we see Jimmy (Woody Allen) about to face a firing squad. He escapes using an exploding cigarette.\n\nJames assigns Moneypenny to find a replacement 007 agent that is desireable to women, but can be trained to resist them. She selects agent Cooper, and spends the night confirming that he is good with women. The next day, she is having trouble staying awake, but James likes Coopers credentials (6\" 2 1/2', 184 lbs, Kama Sutra Black Belt).\n\nJames announces that all remaining agents and trainees will be known as \"James Bond 007\" to confuse the enemy.\n\nCooper goes through his anti-female training, flipping off a girl dressed identically to Ursula Andres in Dr. No. The third girl appears later as Dr. Noah's prisoner.\n\nJames shows up at the headquarters of Vesper Lynd (Ursula Andress). We learn that she is the world's richest spy. She negotiates a trade of the Eiffel Tower for nuclear warheads, and purchases the Lord Nelson's statue. James requests her help in exchange for reducing a large writ for tax arears.\n\nVesper approaches Evelyn Tremble (Peter Sellers) at the Buckingham Club. They come close to kissing, as Vesper suggestively tells him that she would like to go over some of the passeges in his book on winning at Baccarat. She has been reading it in her bed. She will send her car to bring him to her place.\n\nEvelyn arrives as Vesper is disposing of a body. In one of the best looking shots in the movie, they walk behind a huge aquarium - in slow motion - to \"The Look of Love\" song. Vesper is waiting for Evelyn on (in?) her sunken couch. Evelyn admires Lord Nelson's statue from her window. After some suggestive banter, we see Evelyn exercising in his pyjamas and Vesper wearing a nightgown.

    "Casino Royale": "MI6 operative James Bond (Daniel Craig) gains promotion to 00 agent status by assassinating two targets: traitorous section chief Dryden at the British Embassy in Prague and his contact, Fisher. In Uganda, the mysterious Mr. White (Jesper Christensen) (A liaison for an unnamed criminal organization) introduces Steven Obanno (Isaach De Bankole), a high-ranking member of the Lord's Resistance Army, to Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) (A banker who services many of the world's terrorists, he is a mathematical genius and expert chess player, and uses these skills when playing poker), an Albanian private banker to terrorists. Obanno entrusts Le Chiffre with a large sum of money to invest and he wants no risk in the portfolio and a reasonable rate of return; Le Chiffre subsequently buys put options (which are very risky) on aerospace manufacturer Skyfleet, betting on the company's failure given his insider knowledge of a terrorist attack.\n\nIn Madagascar, Bond pursues bomb-maker Mollaka (Sebastien Foucan) (throughout the town on foot) to an embassy (where he tries to hide from Bond. Bond recovers Mollaka's phone which had the code \"Ellipsis\" in his SMS folder), killing him and blowing up the building. Le Chiffre gets the news and is worried that the put options expire in 36 hrs. In London, MI6 chief M (Judi Dench) (Only cast carried over from the Brosnan films) admonishes Bond for causing an international incident and ignoring her orders to capture Mollaka alive. Bond tracks the SMS to Bahamas to the Ocean Club. He looks at the security camera tapes and reckons that at the exact time Mollaka received an SMS, a corrupt Greek official Alex Dimitrios (Simon Abkarian) (Another contractor in the international terrorist underworld and associate of Le Chiffre, he is based in the Bahamas), sent one from his phone. Bond decides to have a closer look at Alex. Using M's account, Bond figures that Alex is connected to Le Chiffre. After winning his 1964 Aston Martin DB5 in a poker game, Bond seduces his wife Solange (Caterina Murino). That night Alex meets Le Chiffre and promises him another bomber to carry out the mission. Bond pursues Dimitrios to Miami (Finding this from Solange) and kills him after Alex had planted the Bomb and the access codes for the new bomber. Bond then pursues the bomber and thwarts the destruction of Skyfleet's prototype airliner at the Miami airport (after following the bomber through the airport and stopping the fuel tanker that he aimed at the airplane and ties the bomb to the assassin and effectively he blows himself up).\n\nTo recoup his clients' lost money (Losses of $101 MM), Le Chiffre organizes a high-stakes Texas hold 'em tournament at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. MI6 enters Bond in the tournament, believing a defeat will force Le Chiffre to seek asylum with the British government in exchange for information on his clients. Bond is paired with Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), a British Treasury agent protecting the $10 million buy-in. During their train ride, they assess and make insightful guesses about each other (She is highly insightful and is quickly able to reason that Bond had a good education but did not come from money originally and that he was orphaned at a young age). In Montenegro, they meet their contact Ren\u00e9 Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini).\n\nBond seems to gain the upper hand, deducing Le Chiffre's \"tell\". Obanno ambushes Le Chiffre (during a 1 hr break after playing for 4 hrs, Le Chiffre retires to his suite, where Obanno confronts him) but allows him to continue playing to win back the money. Obanno's bodyguard spots Bond (via the earpiece inside his ear) and Vesper at Le Chiffre's floor (Bond had followed him), but Bond kills him and Obanno both. After comforting a traumatized Vesper, Bond loses his stake because Le Chiffre has been tipped off about his own tell (Seemed like he had invented his own tell to defeat his opponents at the right hand). Vesper refuses to cover the $5 million Rebuy, but fellow player Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), a CIA agent, agrees to stake Bond (after he stops Bond from assassinating Le Chiffre in public) enough money to continue in exchange for taking Le Chiffre into American custody.\n\nLe Chiffre's lover Valenka (Ivana Milicevic) poisons Bond's martini with digitalis. Retrieving an antidote and defibrillator from his Aston Martin DBS V12, Bond passes out but Vesper rescues him. Bond returns to the game, which culminates in a $115 million hand that Bond wins with a straight flush. Apparently tipped off by Mathis, Le Chiffre kidnaps Vesper and uses her to trap Bond. Le Chiffre brings the captives to an abandoned ship and tortures Bond (Hits his balls with a heavy knotted rope) to reveal the account number and password to the winnings, but Bond refuses (even when Le Chiffre lets Bond believe that Verper is being raped in the next room). Mr. White bursts in and kills Le Chiffre as punishment for betraying the trust of his organization by gambling with their money, leaving Bond and Vesper alive.\n\nBond awakens in an MI6 hospital and has Mathis arrested as a traitor. After transferring the winnings back to the British Govt (overseen by Vesper, who had entered the account number), Bond spends time recovering with Vesper at his side and the two fall in love. He resigns from MI6 and they run away to Venice. When M reveals the money was never deposited, Bond realizes Vesper has betrayed him and follows her as she withdraws the money from her own account to which she had transferred the funds. He follows her to a hand-off of the money, where gunmen take her captive as soon as they spot him. Bond shoots the building's flotation devices, causing the foundation to sink into the Grand Canal. He kills the gunmen, but Vesper is imprisoned in an elevator plunging into the rising water. Seeing Bond wishes to rescue her, she locks the door, indicating he should save himself. Bond is unable to free Vesper before she drowns. Mr. White escapes with the money.\n\nM informs Bond the organization behind Le Chiffre threatened to kill Vesper's lover boyfriend unless she became a double agent. When Bond coldly renounces Vesper as a traitor, saying \"the bitch is dead\", M deduces that she likely made a deal later with White, trading the money for Bond's life. Bond returns to service. Realizing Vesper left her phone to help him, he checks the contacts and locates Mr. White at an estate in Lake Como. Shooting him in the leg, 007 introduces himself: \"The name's Bond. James Bond.\""

    "Castle in the Sky": "&#12302;&#22825;&#31354;&#12398;&#22478;&#12521;&#12500;&#12517;&#12479;&#12303;\n\nA Special Stone\n\nThe Tiger Moth, a flying pirate ship commanded by a pink-haired woman called Dola (voice: Cloris Leachman in the Disney English dub) and manned by her seven or eight grown sons, spots a larger flying ship, from which a girl looks out a window. The men in the cabin with the girl wear dark suits and dark glasses (which is odd, as its dark outside). The men seem to recognize the pirates, who have apparently been lying in wait. They attack using small four-winged chariot-like fliers called flapters, dropping from the flapters to the top of the larger ship. Once inside, the pirates run through a crowd in a spacious glass-walled cabin&mdash;there's a party going on&mdash;and trade gunshots with some of the dark-suited men. Dola shouts \"I want that girl!\"\n\nThe leader of the dark suits enters the girl's cabin, and calling her Sheeta (voice: Anna Paquin), tells her to stay out of the way. He opens a suitcase that holds a transmitter and starts sending a message in Morse code. While he's occupied, Sheeta knocks him out with a wine bottle, reaches inside his jacket and from an inner pocket pulls a necklace, which she puts on. There's knocking and shouting outside the door, so she opens the window, climbs out, and clings to the side of the plane. The pirates burst into the room and recognize the unconscious man, Muska (voice: Mark Hamill). They nearly miss the girl, but one thinks to look out the window and spots her. Dola notices that she's wearing the necklace, and says \"I want that crystal!\"\n\nSheeta inches over to the next window, but one of the pirates gets into the room and rushes the window; she falls. \"There goes my crystal!\" wails Dola. Sheeta disappears into a cloud.\n\nThe opening credits show steampunk industrial scenes of mining, building flying machines, and islands floating in the sky.\n\nSheeta falls from the clouds and hurtles toward the ground, head-first and unconscious. Her crystal lights up and she falls more slowly, turning so she's lying face-up. She seems to be asleep and falling toward a lighted town; it's still dark.\n\nOn the ground, working-class folk in 19th-Century European clothes are shopping and talking. A boy (voice: James Van Der Beek) comes into a shop and asks for some meatballs for his boss. The man behind the counter, calling the boy Pazu (pronounced pot-zu), is surprised that the boy is still working at this hour.\n\nRunning back to work, the boy sees something falling from the sky, realizes it's a person, and catches Sheeta as she floats down into the open shaft of a mine. From down in the hole the mine boss (voice: John Hostetter) irately calls for his dinner, and is too busy with his malfunctioning machinery to listen when Pazu tries to tell him about the girl who came down from the sky. Pazu leaves Sheeta, still sleeping, on a platform near the top of the mine shaft and goes back to work. He operates the elevator hoist by himself for the first time, bringing up a crew of miners and their haul for the day, a small cartload of coal. They complain about not finding any silver or even tin. The boss, predicting that they'll all be starving soon, asks Pazu to shut off the boiler and oil the machinery, and goes home for the night.\n\nDola has returned to her ship, but her sons are out searching for Sheeta in their flapters. One complains there's too much cloud cover and it's too dark, but Dola won't call off the search. She tells them to call her captain, and they reply \"yes, Mom,\" in unison.\n\nThe Legend of the Castle in the Sky\n\nNext morning, Pazu wakes up at home&mdash;he slept on the floor&mdash;and sees Sheeta, still asleep in his bed. He climbs through a skylight to the roof and opens a window in a brick tower attached to his small wooden house, releasing some white doves. Then he climbs to the top of the tower and plays his trumpet. Pazu's house is perched on the lip of a cliff, and is part of a larger building that's mostly in ruins.\n\nThe trumpet wakes Sheeta, who climbs the ladder to the roof, following the music. Pazu shakes her hand and introduces himself, then gives her some food to feed the doves. She's surprised to hear from Pazu that he found her floating in the air; she remembers being in an airship, but nothing more. Pazu has a theory about how she can float; he asks to see her necklace. She hands it to him and says her grandmother gave it to her and it's been in her family for generations. The crystal is blue with a gold symbol. Pazu puts on the necklace and jumps off the roof. He doesn't float. Sheeta finds him in a hole; he's broken through a terrace into his own basement. The room is set up as a workshop, with the wooden framework of a plane in the middle of the floor. When Pazu goes back upstairs to see to breakfast, Sheeta notices a photograph on the wall that looks like an island or a fortress surrounded by clouds. Its captioned \"Laputa.\"\n\nPazu finds her looking at the picture and says his father, who loved to fly, took it from an airship. He explains that most people think Laputa, the island that floats in the sky, is a legend. There's also a picture of Pazu's father's airship, and his journal, with drawings of the castle on the floating island. But nobody believed he'd seen it, and Pazu thinks that being called a liar killed his father. He says that as soon as he finishes building his plane, he'll prove that Laputa is real.\n\nBeware of the Pirates\n\nSheeta sees a car pull up outside, and Dola looks out. Sheeta backs away from the window while Pazu exclaims \"a real automobile! You don't see many of those around here!\" Sheeta says the people in the car are pirates, and they attacked her airship. The pirates are much better dressed than they were the night before and look quite respectable, but Pazu immediately accepts that they're pirates and they're after Sheeta.\n\nWhen the pirates come to the door, Pazu runs out, accompanied, apparently, by another boy. He stops when asked if he's seen a girl and says \"there are about 100 little girls in this town&mdash;which one?\" He and Sheeta run off as the second pirate, who went around and got in the back of the house, comes out holding Sheeta's bluish-purple dress and saying she must be in disguise now.\n\nOn the village street, a pair of pirates in white suits are asking Pazu's boss about a little girl in pigtails and a purple dress. When he says he hasn't seen her, Pazu can be heard in the distance shouting \"Boss! Boss!\" As Pazu and Sheeta come running up the street, the pirate Shalulu (voice: Michael McShane) urges the boss to think harder, saying \"she would be about the age of those two.\" Sheeta trips and falls, dislodging her borrowed cap and exposing her pigtails. The pirates try to grab her but Pazu and Sheeta take refuge behind the boss; Pazu tells him the men are pirates and they're after Sheeta. Pazu's boss turns out to be standing outside his own front door. As the pirates approach and threaten the boss, Sheeta, then Pazu are pulled inside and told by the boss's wife to run out the back door.\n\nMeanwhile at the front door, Shalulu, the beefiest pirate, tries to intimidate the boss by flexing his muscles and bursting out of his shirt. A crowd gathers, and the boss, who's pretty beefy himself, bursts his own buttons. His wife looks over his shoulder, frying pan at the ready, and remarks that she's not going to mend his now-shredded shirt. The two men fight. Soon the villagers in the street take exception to the other pirates' heckling and the fight become a melee.\n\nThe car pulls up to the edge of a cliff, from which Dola and a couple more pirates can see the village street. \"Leave it to my little idiots to start a riot,\" she says. Then she spots Sheeta and Pazu running toward the railroad tracks. The kids jump on a moving train, tell the engineer (voice: Matt K. Miller) the Dola gang is after Sheeta, and ask to be dropped off at the police station in the next town. The engineer, who knows Pazu, asks no questions; all he says is \"help me stoke up the engine.\"\n\nDola drives through the village to extract Shalulu and his party of pugilists, who are astonished to hear that Sheeta has escaped. The villagers chase the car and throw things as it drives off; Dola throws them a hand grenade \"to remember us by.\"\n\nThe engineer spots the pirates' car approaching the moving train; he says the engine is old and can't go any faster. Dola drives the car onto the tracks and draws closer to the train in a hair-raising chase over rickety trestles. When they catch up, Pazu releases the empty cars behind the engine and the train pulls away, but the pirates' car is moving so fast it pushes the loose cars ahead of it and they quickly catch up with the laboring engine. Pazu cranks up the brakes on the lead car and it slows down, separating the pirates from the engine before they can grab Sheeta. As Pazu waves good-bye from the engine, Dola, sounding like the Wicked Witch of the West, says \"you'll get yours!\"\n\nThe pirates heave a train car off the tracks, but pause as they're trying to jettison the second one because Dola notices a military spy plane, which she thinks is Muska.\n\nMeanwhile, the engineer stops because there's an army engine coming toward him. He cheerfully says \"it's the army to the rescue!\" and asks for help for the kids, but Sheeta quickly realizes that the men coming from the military engine look just like the ones who were working with Muska. She says \"good-bye, Pazu,\" and takes off, bad guys in pursuit. Pazu trips them before running after Sheeta. The quick-witted engineer scalds the bad guys with his steam-powered brakes when they try to shoot the fleeing kids.\n\nThe kids almost immediately see the Dola gang coming at them; they're still on a trestle, but Sheeta runs down a siding, telling Pazu not to follow her or he'll get hurt. The Dola gang catches up to them, destroying the trestle as they approach. Pazu and Sheeta jump off and dangle precariously as the gang's train car passes over them. Dola watches Sheeta and Pazu fall toward the town below and then, with a flash of light, they float back up as Sheeta's crystal saves them.\n\nPazu tells Sheeta, \"this is what happened the first time I saw you&mdash;I knew there was something special about that necklace.\" Dola isn't surprised and tells her sons, \"it's the power of the crystal.\" The soldiers from the armored train can see the kids too. They float gently down into a mineshaft.\n\nThe pirates go after them, while overhead, the spy plane watches.\n\nLost in the Mine\n\nSheeta's crystal, which has been glowing, goes dark when they land at the bottom of the shaft, but Pazu has a lantern. They walk for a bit in the old mine, then sit down to eat. (Pazu is still carrying the fried egg on toast he made for breakfast.) Asked where she's from, Sheeta says \"I come from Gondoa, deep in the northern mountains.\" After her parents died, she cared for their farm animals until some men came and took her away&mdash;the same men in dark glasses who are now pursuing her.\n\nPazu realizes that the men and Dola are both after the crystal, which Sheeta didn't realize was so powerful. She says her mother gave it to her before she died, and told her never to show it or give it away to anyone. Pazu says \"we orphans should stick together.\" Sheeta apologizes for getting him mixed up in her problems, but Pazu isn't sorry at all: \"this is the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me!\"\n\nThe children are frightened when they hear someone approaching, but it's an old miner friend of Pazu's, Uncle Pom (voice: Richard Dysart). They tell him there are pirates chasing them and the army is right behind the pirates, and Uncle Pom thinks that sounds splendid. He takes them to his camp by an underground lake and gives them tea. He says that the rocks speak to him, and they've been restless since last night. Then he blows out the lamp, leaving them in the silent darkness.\n\nIt doesn't stay dark long. Soon crystals on the floor, ceiling, and walls around them start to glow. Pazu wonders what's doing that, and Uncle Pom cracks open a rock to show him; it briefly glows. He says \"it's a long-forgotten element called aetherium. People no longer know how to mine aetherium.\" Sheeta pulls out her crystal, which is glowing. The old man says \"that's a pure aetherium crystal!\" Pom tells them such crystals haven't existed since his great-grandfather's time; according to legend, only the people of the floating city of Laputa knew how to make them. It's aetherium that makes Laputa float. After a few minutes Uncle Pom is overcome and asks Sheeta to put the crystal away&mdash;\"it's speaking too loudly to me, too sadly.\"\n\nUncle Pom's great-grandfather told him that the rocks become restless when Laputa appears over the mine. He tells Sheeta that the crystal's power comes from the earth, and to use it selfishly will bring great unhappiness.\n\nOutside, the military spy plane flies off and the disheveled pirates, who are peeking out of the mine, ask Dola if they can go back to the ship. She says it's too quiet; they decide to sit tight.\n\nThe kids say goodbye to Uncle Pom at another entrance to the mine.\n\nCaptured\n\nOnce outdoors, Pazu and Sheeta climb a steep hill and stop to admire a huge cloud. Pazu is sure the cloud is hiding Laputa. Sheeta says she hasn't told him the traditional name her family gave her: Lusheeta Toel Ul Laputa. While they're talking, a plane spots them and lands nearby; they're captured by army men in green uniforms and a man in a dark suit and dark glasses, who knocks Pazu out with the butt of his pistol. Muska disembarks from the plane and growls \"and about time!\" when told they've been captured.\n\nPazu comes to in a bare cell in a coastal fortress. He hears soldiers drilling outside his arrow-slit window, but can't see them.\n\nIn a room above, Muska tells a portly general (voice: Jim Cummings) that they'll get what they want, but it will take time. The general responds that they're wasting time; Muska should twist an arm or two and the girl will talk. Muska says military tactics risk wasting more time. The general says military tactics would have saved them from Dola's interference, but Muska replies, \"it was a military transmission that the pirates decoded.\" He says the general's job is to mobilize the troops when the time comes. The general says he's in charge of finding Laputa; Muska counters that as the government's secret agent, he's in charge of the general.\n\nSheeta huddles on a window seat in a sunny tower room. Muska walks in and picks up a dress, remarking that it's fit for a princess. Sheeta asks if Pazu's all right and asks to see him. \"Your friend is being treated as if he were the guest of royalty,\" he says.\n\nHe takes her down in an elevator to show her a battered, broken giant robot. \"Laputa was just a legend until this dropped from the sky.\" Muska explains that his job is to figure out the robot's&mdash;Laputa's&mdash;secrets. He points out a small red shield on the robot's chest; it bears the same symbol as Sheeta's crystal. He needs her help to get the crystal to lead them to Laputa. Sheeta tells him to keep the crystal and take Laputa's treasures for himself. Muska, trying to convince her that it's not about the money, says Laputa used to dominate the world, and it's still dangerous. And the stone only works for her. Sheeta just wants to see Pazu. Muska says if she'll cooperate, she can help free Pazu. If she won't, he can't control what the military might do to him. Then Muska calls her by her real name, Lusheeta Toel Ul Laputa. \"Toel means ruler in Laputian; Ul means true. You are the legitimate heir to the throne of Laputa, Princess Lusheeta.\" Sheeta is stunned.\n\nA Broken Promise\n\nPazu, meanwhile, is climbing the walls of his cell when a soldier comes to let him out to see Sheeta and Muska. Muska says there's been a misunderstanding; they had no idea how bravely he fought to defend Sheeta from the pirates. Pazu is confused, and still more confused when Sheeta tells him to forget about Laputa. Muska says Sheeta has agreed to help the army search (secretly) for Laputa, and Pazu really should forget about it. Pazu objects, but Sheeta leaves. Muska gives Pazu several gold coins \"to show our appreciation of your efforts.\" Pazu walks out of the fortress. As Sheeta watches him go from her window, Muska fastens the crystal around her neck and tells her to remember the words that bring the crystal to life. \"Keep your promise and you too will be free.\"\n\nIn the mining village, it's evening. A small child with a broom chases a pig out of her house. She see Pazu walking slowly up the street and calls her mother, the boss's wife, who comes out to say they've all been worried, and where has he been and what happened to his friend? Pazu only says \"it's over now,\" and runs off. He comes to his own front door and finds the pirates making themselves at home. They discover the gold in his pocket and accuse him of selling Sheeta out; he replies that he only left because Sheeta told him to. \"So you believed her and you came back here?\" sneers Dola. Dola suggests that the army forced Sheeta to make a deal to save Pazu's life, and they're not likely to keep Sheeta alive once they get what they want.\n\nA telegraph receiver on the table comes to life. Dola translates the Morse code: \"They're calling for air destroyer Goliath. They're about to take off with Sheeta. We've got to hurry or it will be too late!\"\n\nPazu begs to come with them. Dola agrees, thinking he'll be useful in getting Sheeta to cooperate. He grabs his father's aviator headgear, complete with goggles, and opens the dovecote so his birds can get out and feed themselves while he's gone. The pirates take off in their flapters, Pazu riding with Dola.\n\nThe huge airship Goliath arrives at the fortress as Muska and the general watch. The general asks if the girl has surrendered the information yet; Muska says it will take a little more time. The general says they'll have plenty of time aboard Goliath, and they'll depart at first light.\n\nThe Rescue\n\nThe pirates buzz through the night in their flapters. Dola urges them to hurry as they have to get there before sun-up. Pazu thinks of Sheeta.\n\nSheeta's looking out at the night and remembering a time when her grandmother taught her a spell that would help her if she was ever in trouble. Sheeta learned the words in Laputian; in English, they mean \"Save me and revive the eternal light.\" She recites the Laputian, and her crystal lights up and emits so much energy that she cries out in distress and tries to cover her eyes. Far below, the robot is activated and its broken parts move together. Muska comes into her room, saying \"the sacred light! The ancient documents were true&mdash;it's not just a legend!\"\n\nHe reaches for the glowing crystal but it seems to hurt him. He pulls his hand back but demands that she tell him the spell. The soldiers guarding the robot think they hear something and open its door, which it blocks when they try to close it again. They get on the phone to say the robot is alive. It bursts out of its prison; at the same moment, the crystal goes dark. When Sheeta and Muska come out of her room, they see the robot climbing the stairs toward them. The soldiers shoot at it, doing no damage, then shut the fire door at the top of the stairs. The robot melts it. Muska is amazed at the robot's power. He realizes the crystal has brought it to life. The robot uses a laser to cut the wooden walkway where Muska, Sheeta, and others are standing; the pieces separate, leaving Sheeta alone on one side. The robot unfurls its wings, flies up the inside of the tower, and follows the terrified Sheeta up the stairs at the top. On the roof of the tower, her crystal flashes again and points through the clouds&mdash;at Laputa, she and Muska both believe, but we can't see it. The robot breaks through the roof of the tower as the soldiers bring their artillery to bear on it. The robot communes with the crystal for a moment before it's hit by a shell and falls. The soldiers try to revive Sheeta, who groans, and then the robot comes back to life. It picks her up and starts shooting with its laser eye. It does a lot of damage to the fortress, leaving much of it in flames, and starts setting fire to the surrounding countryside.\n\nFrom their flapters, the pirates see the fortress lit up in the distance. The sun is beginning to rise. When Sheeta comes to, she tells the robot to stop, climbing up to sit on its shoulder. But by then everything around them is burning.\n\nPazu has spotted them, though, and directs Dola to the top of the tower. In trying to get close enough to grab her, they clip the tower; Dola is knocked out and the flapter plummets toward the water below until, at the last moment, Pazu gets to the controls and pulls out of the dive. Dola recovers and they make another attempt to get Sheeta. The robot, which seems to be in some kind of trouble itself&mdash;burning out from within&mdash;has put Sheeta on the battlements of the tower. Muska sees what they're up to just as Pazu, hanging upside-down from the flapter, grabs Sheeta. \"It's not over,\" Muska promises himself as the pirates fly off.\n\nAn Adventurous Trip\n\nAs the general expresses his anger over the loss of Sheeta and the robot and orders a pursuit, one of Muska's men draws Muska away: \"I think we may have found what you've been looking for.\" Muska finds Sheeta's crystal on the ground near the tower, still pointing to Laputa. He's able to pick it up. He sends a message to the general that they'll be departing on time.\n\nSheeta cries on Pazu's shoulder as the pirates fly them toward Pazu's home. Dola is annoyed because Sheeta lost the crystal. Pazu asks if they can sail with the pirates. They say they'll work, and Sheeta says she needs to find out about Laputa for herself. They fly over Pazu's house but keep going and rejoin the pirates' airship, the Tiger Moth. One of Dolas sons takes Pazu to the engine room and introduces Pazu to his father, a short bald man with a huge mustache. He's the ship's engineer, and he needs an assistant. Pazu immediately shows his mechanical ability. After conferring with Sheeta about the location of Laputa, Dola announces that Goliath is heading for Laputa and they're going after her. The first to spot Laputa will get 10 gold coins.\n\nDola takes Sheeta in hand, telling her she has to start talking like a pirate (Sheeta's \"shiver me timbers\" is not convincing) and dressing like a pirate (Dola gives her an enormous pair of pink pants). And Sheeta has to clean up the filthy galley (which is piled high with dirty dishes, pots, and pans) so she can start producing the five meals a day the hungry pirates require. Dola gives her an hour. When Dola opens the galley door, most of her sons fall into the room&mdash;they've been outside listening.\n\nLater, as Pazu hangs on the hull of the airship hammering at something, one of Dola's sons peers through the galley porthole at Sheeta, who's making soup. He goes in and offers to help. It turns out that several of his brothers are already there with the same idea.\n\nIn the captain's quarters, Dola and her husband are playing chess. He remarks that its not usual for her to challenge a ship like Goliath. He says the kids are cute, and the little girl reminds him of Dola. Cut to the crew, eating hungrily and asking Sheeta for seconds.\n\nThat night, one of the sons comes to wake Pazu, who's sleeping on the floor under some bunks; its Pazu's turn to stand watch. The pirate gives Pazu a brown poncho, remarking that it's cold, and sends him up the ladder on the outside of the ship to the crow's nest at the top of the hull. Sheeta, who's been sleeping on Dola's floor, gets up and follows him. She's almost blown away as she climbs into the crow's nest. They talk a bit and Pazu throws the poncho over her, so they're both in it at once. Dola is awake and can hear them through a speaking tube. Sheeta confesses that she's afraid of going to Laputa; she doesn't want anyone else to get hurt. She feels awful about the robot, which died to save her. As Dola listens, Sheeta talks about the spells her grandmother taught her&mdash;not just the one that revived the robot, but a spell to find things, a spell to cure sickness, and a spell of destruction, which her grandmother told her never to use. (To give power to good spells, she had to know evil ones too.) But she never knew the spells were connected to her necklace. She worries that Laputa has the same power as the necklace, and poses the same danger if the power is misused.\n\nPazu argues that even if she'd thrown the crystal away and they'd never met, sooner or later someone would have managed to land on Laputa and claim it. They can't let it fall into the hands of people like Muska. If they run away, Muska will chase them forever. Sheeta feels bad that Pazu is becoming a pirate; he says he isn't going to become a pirate, and Dola will understand&mdash;\"she's much nicer than she pretends to be.\" He promises that after they find Laputa, they'll go to Gondoa and see her old home. Then they spot Goliath, a shadow in the clouds beneath them, and raise the alarm.\n\nSomething's Wrong\n\nDola orders a change of course, but Goliath breaks through the clouds and starts shooting at them. Tiger Moth quickly descends into the cloud layer; they get away without much damage, and Goliath doesn't pursue.\n\nOn Goliath's bridge, the general argues for chasing the Tiger Moth. Colonel Muska won't let him, saying it's a waste of energy. He has Sheeta's crystal on the compass, still directing him to Laputa.\n\nOn Tiger Moth's bridge, Dola calls up to Pazu through the speaking tube. She says they can't lose Goliath, so Pazu must keep her in sight. To do that, he'll have to release the crow's nest from its moorings on the hull; it remains attached by a cable and flies like a kite. She explains how to release it and open the wings, then tells Sheeta to come down because flying the kite is man's work. Sheeta points out that Dola is female, and that she, Sheeta, grew up in the mountains, and she can handle this. Dola, laughing, gives in and says once they take off they'll need to use the phone to communicate. Dola's phone immediately rings; when she picks it up, Sheeta's voice says \"you mean this phone?\"\n\nPazu releases the kite. The ride is peaceful except when the wind gusts. They can't see Goliath, but Pazu does see a storm coming. As a precaution against the storm, Pazu tells Sheeta to get rope out of his bag and tie them together. On the bridge, the pirates note that the mercury is dropping fast and it's an hour to sunrise. When the sun comes up, Pazu and Sheeta notice that it's in the wrong place&mdash;or more accurately, they're flying in the wrong direction: east, not north. The bridge reports that something is confusing the compass, which is pointing east. Sheeta sees the cloud that covers Laputa, heading right for them. Dola, realizing it's also a hurricane, orders the engines to reverse, but the Tiger Moth is already caught in the winds. When Goliath appears above them, they're sitting ducks.\n\nPazu and Sheeta in the kite and Muska aboard Goliath are determined to get through the storm to Laputa. The kite passes through an electrical field into a weird zone where for a moment Pazu catches site of a familiar ghostly airship, and recognizes the pilot&mdash;his father. Then they break into relatively clear air over Laputa. They're still trailing their cable, but its not attached to the Tiger Moth any more. It drags among the vegetation on Laputa, slowing them down so they come to a softer landing than they might otherwise have done, but it's not gentle. Pazu and Sheeta are knocked out when they land and fall out of the kite.\n\nThe Wonder of a New Place\n\nAs they lie there, the fog and clouds disperse. They come to on a sunny, flowery lawn at the top of a tower, still tied together. Thrilled at finally being on Laputa, they laugh and hug each other and twirl exuberantly. They can see old stone structures that look a little the worse for wear, and a huge tree that seems to be the center of the island. A giant robot shows up and picks up their kite. Sheeta thinks it can't know who she is as she doesn't have the aetherium crystal, but she asks it not to take the kite as they need it to get home. The robot pauses and seems to register her remarks, but moves the kite anyway. There's a bird's nest underneath it, holding three eggs. The robot puts the kite down nearby and flashes and burbles at them, which Sheeta understands to mean they should follow. The robot leads them across a bridge, where they see some small animals dive into an ornamental pool. But when they peer into the water, they can see a city down there. The robot is still walking. They run to catch up; it leads them to an enormous garden. The garden is enclosed in nearly invisible walls; at the center is a giant tree that Pazu guesses is a thousand years old. There's some stonework scattered around, and some inside the tree. They see another robot and realize it's not the one they followed; this one is dead and seems to have been frozen in place for a very long time. Looking more closely at the roots of the tree, then can see that they're littered with dead, moss-covered robots.\n\nOn a flat stone that looks like a grave marker, someone has laid a row of pink flowers. Their robot comes back holding another pink flower, which Sheeta takes with thanks. Some striped animals that look like a cross between cats and squirrels appear on the robot's shoulders and chase each other around its neck. The robot looks at them and goes about its business. The kids think it's probably the only working robot left.\n\nIn the underground part of the city, a detonator triggers an explosion. It disturbs birds and is followed by several smaller explosions&mdash;or aftershocks. Pazu and Sheeta run off to find the source of the disturbance. They find a section of the city that's been destroyed&mdash;Pazu attributes that to the army.\n\nThe Invasion\n\nSheeta and Pazu spot Goliath, moored at the edge of a large plaza and disgorging crowds of soldiers from two gangplanks. Beside it are the ruins of the Tiger Moth. Sheeta worries about Dola and the boys; Pazu sees that they've been captured. They know the pirates will be hanged if they can't help them escape. A soldier brings the general a heavy, jeweled necklace; he reports they've broken through the wall and the city is full of treasure. The general taunts the pirates with the necklace and tells Muska to send a radio message about their discovery of the city, adding snidely, \"see if you can make it difficult to decode.\" He runs off to keep his underlings from pocketing any jewels, and Muska smugly observes that the jewels have thrown \"those fools off the scent.\"\n\nPazu has a plan. He and Sheeta climb down the roots of the giant tree toward Goliath. They peer through a high window into a huge chamber where soldiers are rushing to and fro, grabbing treasure and taking it outside. But there's shooting going on as the looters work. Some other soldiers break through a door, enter the chamber, and fight with the looters. Sheeta says they can't let the soldiers ruin the garden too. Pazu says they have to find the aetherium crystal to protect the garden, then notes that all the storm clouds around Laputa have disappeared. If that hadn't happened, the army wouldn't have been able to land. Pazu thinks they used Sheeta's crystal to dispel the storm, and resolves to prevent Muska from learning to use the crystal. Sheeta realizes that the spell of destruction might be the only way to do that. Just then they hear soldiers nearby, looking for them. They sneak off among the tree-roots.\n\nThe kids climb down near the Tiger Moth, staying out of sight as much as they can. At the broken foot of an arcade below the plaza where the ruined Tiger Moth and her crew are being held, Pazu has to jump from one pier to the next. But the pier he jumps to crumbles as he climbs. While he struggles to hang on, Muska and two of his men emerge on the walkway Sheeta and Pazu were on a minute before; they're looking for a door. Sheeta is just a few yards away hiding in a niche, and Pazu is in full view behind the men, trying to reach a window. Muska, consulting a little blue book, finds the hidden door and uses Sheeta's crystal to open it. They turn around when they hear Pazu knocking loose another chunk of masonry and one of Muska's henchmen takes a shot at him as he reaches the window. Sheeta rushes them, knocks one over, and tries to run, but Muska catches her by a pigtail. Pazu, too far away to help, shouts at them not to hurt Sheeta. The henchmen shoot again and a bullet grazes Pazu's cheek; he disappears inside as the soldiers on the plaza above him look down. Muska tells them he's caught another pirate, and there's one more under their feet. Pazu shouts to Sheeta that he'll find her. Muska and his party go through the secret door with Sheeta in tow; the opening disappears behind them.\n\nThe soldiers above Pazu throw a hand grenade through his window; when it goes off, the smoke comes up through the paving stones the pirates are sitting on. Dola pushes a brick down into the hollow space below her. When the soldiers run off, Pazu looks up through the hole. He says he's going to rescue Sheeta, but first he cuts Dola's ropes first and passes her his knife. In return, Dola shakes a large, wide-mouthed handgun and a couple of shells out of her pant leg, so Pazu is armed. In the treasure chamber, the general's men report that Muska destroyed all the radios, and that Muska and his two men were seen heading for the black dome (an inverted dome under the island that presumably houses the tech keeping it afloat). The general orders his men to arrest Colonel Muska. Pazu watches them march off.\n\nMuska, Sheeta, and Muska's two henchmen descend into the black dome on an elevator platform. They pass through a shaft made of black stone blocks carved with geometric designs. When they reach the bottom, Muska leaves his protesting men behind, saying only royalty is allowed to enter the central chamber. He and Sheeta descend a little further and enter a chamber that's been infiltrated by tree roots. Muska is angry, saying the roots don't belong there and he'll have them burned. He checks his little blue book again and directs Sheeta down a corridor, also lined with tree roots. Muska pulls some roots aside to expose a door, which glows and opens when he holds the crystal against it. Inside is a bright sort of garden, walled with tree roots, lit by a glowing ball of tree roots at the center, and full of tall plants that reach Muska's shoulders. He's furious at finding more roots and plants here. He pushes through the roots surrounding the glow in the center and reveals a large, blue rotating octahedron. He exults that at last he's found the largest aetherium crystal ever&mdash;Laputa's power source.\n\nMuska says the stone has been awaiting the return of its king for 700 years. Looking at his book again, he wades through the plants and finds a slant-topped black stone like a podium, with writing on the slanted surface. Batting aside a cloud of gnats, Muska checks the black stone's inscription against his book and says they're the same. Sheeta asks him who he is, and he says he, too, has an old, secret name: Romska Polo Ul Laputa. He says he and Sheeta share royal ancestors, but their ancestors left Laputa to live on Earth, which Muska considers a mistake.\n\nAs Pazu clings to a tree root on the outer surface of the black dome, there's an explosion. The soldiers who set off the explosion run to the site of the blast&mdash;they seem to be trying to open Muska's hidden door&mdash;and find that the stone is singed but undamaged. The general is ordering them to try again using all the dynamite they have when Muska's voice over a PA system says there's no need to do that; they may come in. Muska moves Sheeta's crystal over the surface of the black podium stone. Some symbols light up and the big carved black blocks in the central shaft move out of the walls of their own accord and rearrange themselves. Muska's two men, who have been trying to climb out, are knocked loose. They scream and fall. The black dome rumbles and shakes, then starts to open. The vine Pazu is clinging to breaks loose at the top and he falls with it, hollering. It swings and he's able to grab another vine that's still attached. A panel opens above him and a huge stone column that looks like a jet emerges; we can see that there are seven of them arranged in a circle near the bottom of the black dome. Pazu scrambles away.\n\nThe general and his soldiers are invited to walk through a door Muska has caused to open for them. They still can't see him. A room like a viewing platform opens at the bottom of the dome and the general and the soldiers go in. Pazu can see what's happening from the outside. Muska projects images of himself and Sheeta into the room and announces to the soldiers that they're in the presence of the king of Laputa. He demonstrates the power of the reborn kingdom of Laputa by creating a sort of bomb with the seven giant jets and dropping it through the clouds. They can't see where it falls, but they see the top of its fiery mushroom cloud. \"The fire of heaven that destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah in the Old Testament!\" gloats Muska. \"The Rhamaniya referred to it as Indra's Arrow. The entire world will once again kneel before the power of Laputa!\"\n\nThe general changes his tone: \"Well done, Muska! You're a credit to our country. As such, you deserve this reward!\"\n\nHe shoots at the projection of Muska, which has no effect except to make Muska sneer at his stupidity. Muska reaches for the black stone; Sheeta bites his hand and tells them to run. Some do, but the general and many soldiers are still standing there when the floor is pulled out from under them. As they fall, Muska laughs and his projection disappears into the ceiling.\n\nSurviving soldiers run through corridors in the dome. They pass giant robots coming to life and emerging on all fours from niches in the walls. When the robots get outside, the pirates spot them and decide to run for it in their flapters, which are undamaged inside the wreck of the Tiger Moth. The soldiers are rushing back aboard Goliath, but it pulls away before everyone has boarded, sending those on the gangplanks to their deaths.\n\nOnce her crew is aboard the flapters, Dola is reluctant to leave without Pazu and Sheeta. In the aetherium crystal's garden chamber, Muska throws Sheeta to the ground and tells her she'd better be gracious to the new king, as she'll be spending a lot of time with him. He uses the black podium to call up an image of Goliath, which is shooting at Laputa. He scoffs that the fools don't understand that it's useless to fight him.\n\nGoliath's artillery knocks Pazu from his vine on the underside of the dome. He gets a toehold at the lip of a chute that disgorges a stream of flying robots, which attack Goliath. Once the robots are away, Pazu takes off his shoes and climbs up the chute. At the top of the chute he finds a space filled with gears and other mechanisms; he keeps climbing and shouts for Sheeta.\n\nOutside, the robots are destroying Goliath; Muska watches and gloats while Sheeta tells him to leave Goliath alone. She gets loose (her hands have been tied since Muska caught her at the secret door) and rushes Muska, demanding her crystal. She grabs it and runs. She pounds on the door of the garden chamber while Muska strolls over, telling her to be good and give the crystal back. The door disappears before he reaches her&mdash;her crystal lights up&mdash;and she runs again. Muska, still unconcerned and unhurried, continues to follow her. He tells her that no one can hear her, and only he can help her.\n\nPazu uses Dola's gun to make a hole in a wall. He scrambles through and runs, still shouting for Sheeta. Finally Sheeta hears him and runs toward his voice. Just before Muska catches up, Sheeta passes her crystal to Pazu through a tiny opening; she tells Pazu to throw it in the ocean. Muska has a revolver. He tries to shoot Pazu through the chink, then warns him to protect the crystal if he wants to see the girl alive. Pazu blasts a bigger hole in the wall, crawls through, and runs after them.\n\nRedemption\n\nSheeta runs into an empty room; Muska follows and shoots. She drops and he tells her to get up, which she does. \"How appropriate that we've ended up in the throne room,\" he remarks.\n\nFacing him across the floor, Sheeta answers that it's no longer a throne room&mdash;now it's their tomb. A king without compassion does not deserve a kingdom, she tells him. She recites the words to a song from her home valley of Gondoa: \"Take root in the ground, live in harmony with the wind, plant your seeds in the winter, and rejoice with the birds in the coming of spring.\" No matter how many weapons you have, the world cannot live without love. He aims at her again and shoots off one of her pigtails; she barely flinches. He insists that he'll return Laputa to life, that its power is the dream of all mankind. He shoots off her other pigtail and says \"your ears are next unless you get on your knees and obey me. Give me that stone!\"\n\nPazu arrives and tells Muska he's hidden the stone. Muska says he'll kill Sheeta if Pazu doesn't produce the stone. Pazu responds that Muska can have the stone if Pazu can talk to Sheeta. Throughout this exchange, Sheeta implores Pazu to take the stone and run. Muska gives them a minute to decide what to do. Pazu embraces Sheeta and asks her to whisper the spell of destruction in his ear so they can say it together. \"Put your hand in mine and trust me,\" he says, showing her the crystal in his hand. He tells her Dola and the boys are free, so she doesn't need to worry about them. When Muska says their time is up, Pazu throws down his gun. They hold out their clasped hands and say a single word, \"Balus.\"\n\nThe big crystal flashes, as does the small one in their hands, dazzling them and Muska, who screams. The big crystal falls, breaking through its enclosure, and Laputa begins to disintegrate. Muska, blinded, stumbles around screaming \"no!\" The pirates finally shove off in their flapters but hover nearby to watch Laputa fall apart. Under the island, it rains masonry and broken robots. Dola realizes Sheeta and Pazu used the spell of destruction to save Laputa from Muska.\n\nOne of the pirates sees a blue light among the roots of Laputa's central tree. The spell doesn't seem to affect the central tree and the structure most closely attached to it (the garden?)&mdash;or the giant aetherium crystal. Once it has shed the black dome and most of the buildings, the tree floats off, the pale blue crystal glowing through its roots.\n\nSheeta wakes up among the roots of the tree with Pazu. Sheeta says they survived because they protected the tree, and it protected them in return. They find their kite, which looks intact. They climb aboard and take a last flight around Laputa. They see the last robot still tending the garden.\n\nWhen they leave Laputa behind, the kids soon encounter the convoy of pirates in their overloaded flapters. The pirates are overjoyed to see them alive. Dola's husband, the Tiger Moth's engineer, mourns the loss of their airship, and Dola, calling him a big baby, promises to buy him another one. Which it turns out they can easily afford&mdash;every pirate shows off jewelry worth a fortune. Pazu and Sheeta don't stay with the pirates, though; they get back in the kite and fly off into the clouds together. Perhaps they're heading north, for Gondoa."

    "Catch That Kid": "Madeline Rose \"Maddy\" Phillips (Kristen Stewart) is a 12-year-old girl who loves to climb. Her father Tom (Sam Robards) has climbed Mount Everest so it runs in the family. Several years earlier, Tom fell more than 100 feet during a climb and because her parents Tom and Molly (Jennifer Beals) are afraid she might hurt herself, they have ordered Maddy not to climb. Tom had some internal injuries from that earlier fall which he did not know about and now the injury has paralyzed him from the neck down. There is an experimental operation costing $250,000 which can save him, but insurance will not pay for the operation and the family does not have the money. Harderbach Financial's president Brisbane (Michael Des Barres) refuses to loan the amount and does so by putting loopholes in a contract Molly signed (he is really trying to avoid loaning any money at all). When asked if he has a heart, Brisbane coldly responds \"This is not an emotional issue, Mrs. Phillips. A bank has no heart. Only paper in a vault.\" That is when Maddy first gets the idea to rob the bank.\n\nMaddy steals three go-carts from her father and convinces her two friends Gus (Max Thieriot) and Austin (Corbin Bleu) to help her. They remain hesitant, so she tells both of them that she loves him and does not care for the other and gives half of her friendship necklace to each of them, claiming she has the other half and kissing them both on the cheek. They break into Harderbach Financial (a bank in which Molly had begun to work for, creating a security system). They manage to break in, but with her mother at the hospital visiting their father, she is forced to babysit her younger brother Max (Grant Hayden Scott and Sean Avery Scott). She and Gus progress to a room with thousands of security deposit boxes while Austin keeps the guards away from them. Maddy has to free climb to get to the exit when her hook gets caught in a crack when using the handhelds. She cracks the code (finding it is Madeline) and they flee the room, unintentionally setting off the alarm as they did not type the exit code. While escaping from the guard dogs at which point Austin demonstrates his dog-training skills, the trio is caught by Gus' brother, Chad, who tasers his partner (and then himself, though accidentally) after understanding the situation. However, just before escaping, Gus and Austin find out that Maddy played them after seeing each other's necklaces and leave her, but later come back for her.\n\nThe three hop into their go carts, trailed by the police, but Austin holds all the cash in his cart, starts running out of gas. He then leaps into Gus' cart, and they escape to the hospital. They rejoin with Maddy in time to disable police cruisers by popping the tires with jacks. When Mrs. Phillips arrives, Brisbane attempts to pass all the blame on her. But ultimately, he is rejected by a French man named Francois who says Brisbane's irresponsibility of having a party with an untested security system is a knucklehead move. Meanwhile, the kids make it to the hospital. However, they are caught up to by Maddy's mother, the bank security, the police, and the press. Maddy's mother then takes responsibility, saying that this was an authorized test for the bank's security. As they leave, reporters outside of the hospital mention about the incident and how it was motivated when the insurance company wouldn't help the Phillips family.\n\nThe following morning, Mrs. Phillips says what Maddy did was wrong, but apologizes as it was her over-protection that started all the trouble in the first place. The press sympathizes with them, allowing them to hold a fundraiser the day after earning enough money for Maddy's father's surgery. Even a friend named Mr. Hartmann (John Carroll Lynch) gives a \"consultation fee\" of $50,000. As Brisbane's irresponsibility got him fired, Hartman is now the president of the bank. At the go cart rally after the operation, Gus and Austin make Maddy decide who she loves. She sniffs both of them and causes a debate between them. While they do so, she backs away and they run after her saying who is the better boyfriend and the movie ends."

    "Category 6: Day of Destruction": "Andy Goodman (Brian Dennehy) is a week away from a forced retirement from his position as chief meteorologist at the National Weather Service storm prediction center. However, tornadoes level Las Vegas, an area normally not prone to the storms. Concerned and upset that the storm system formed unnoticed and that they were unable to warn the people, Goodman begins closely tracking the system. Goodman receives field reports from his friend \"Tornado Tommy\" (Randy Quaid) and assistance from new intern Sabrina Rogers (Alicia Johnston). As time passes, he realizes the system is heading towards Chicago, joined by an unusual warm storm coming from the south, which is already causing a record-breaking heat wave in the city, and an abnormally early cold front from the Arctic.\n\nMeanwhile, Mitch Benson (Thomas Gibson), the Chief of Operations at Midwest Electric, is struggling to keep power going to the residents because the six-week heat wave is straining the system and residents are refusing to follow power conservation requests. To get more energy, he is working with the company's largest supplier, Lexer, but the company's CEO is trying to find new ways to profit from this crisis. Benson also finds himself caught in a conflict of interest as he is having an affair with the Lexer's public relations representative, Rebecca Kerns (Chandra West).\n\nAmbitious reporter Amy Harkin (Nancy McKeon) is stuck reporting on the heat wave while trying to find proof behind the scenes that Lexer and Midwest are responsible for the lack of sufficient power. The Secretary of Energy, Shirley Abbott (Dianne Wiest), is actively warning various politicians and the president that the power grid is too outdated to handle real natural disasters and that it is too vulnerable to attack. Dan London (Ari Cohen), the chief engineer of Lexer, has also repeatedly warned Lexer that their systems are too vulnerable to hackers, but the company is only interested in going with the cheapest options. He decides to blow the whistle on the company to Harkin, but as he refuses to appear on camera, Harkin's boss will not allow the piece to air.\n\nAs the storms approach, early storms knock out the city's primary power generating plant, and Benson is forced to negotiate with Lexer for even more power. Not realizing the devastating nature of the storms coming, London sets out to force Lexer to listen to his warnings by hacking the system and causing a cascading chain reaction that knocks out all of the power in Chicago. Goodman and his team are unable to warn the citizens that the storms have formed into a category 6 hurricane over the Great Lakes and will hit Chicago head on.\n\nHarkin realizes what happened to the power and rushes to find London, while Benson and Secretary Abbott gather energy from a multitude of other companies to get around the breakdown at Lexer. Unaware of what each party is doing, London quickly reverses the hacks at the same time as the energy starts flowing in from other companies. This overloads the system, knocking out the entire Midwest power grid as the storm hits the city.\n\nUnable to do anything further, Benson rushes to find his family after he receives word that they are trapped at a mall and that his daughter has been accidentally shot by her ex-boyfriend. Harkin gives Benson a ride to the mall to pick up his family, then they go to rescue her pregnant sister-in-law from an elevator. After Amy's cameraman is injured while rescuing her sister-in-law, Harkin stays behind with him and their neighbor. The others rush to reach the airport during the 15-minute eye of the hurricane, where they are picked up in a plane piloted by Harkin's brother, an air force weather pilot. After the storm passes, Harkin keeps her promise and tells London's story on air."

    "Category 7: The End of the World": "Following the events in Category 6: Day of Destruction, the superstorm that hit Chicago is continuing to grow in size and strength, with tornadoes hitting Paris and destroying the Eiffel Tower. Judith Carr (Gina Gershon), the new head of FEMA struggles to coordinate efforts to prepare for the aftermath of the storm and provide aid to ravaged areas. She calls in her former college lover, Dr. Ross Duffy (Cameron Daddo), and her father Senator Ryan Carr (Robert Wagner) to help her try to determine what is causing the storms and how to deal with the political issues. Tommy Tornado (Randy Quaid), who survived his seeming death in the previous film, returns to aid in tracking the storm in the United States, assisted by scientist Faith Clavell (Shannen Doherty). Similar storms are developing around the country and an interaction between urban heat islands and \"falling chunks of mesosphere\" fuels the storms making them more powerful. Hurricane Eduardo strikes toward Florida while the Category 6 storm hits Buffalo and heads towards New York City.\n\nDuring these catastrophic events, two Christian fundamentalists (James Brolin and Swoosie Kurtz) fake the arrival of the plagues of Egypt to lure in new converts, culminating in their kidnapping of the first-born children of Judith Carr and other high-ranking officials. When Tommy and Faith get their data to FEMA when in New York, Judith realizes that Hurricane Eduardo is heading towards Washington, D.C. and the Category 6 storm in New York is heading in the same direction. When both storms collide with the mesosphere, it turns into a \"Category 7\" hurricane, obliterating anything in its path. The force of the storm is so massive, that a category 7 could potentially cause a global catastrophe, possibly leading to the apocalypse (hence the title)."

    "Catwoman": "The figure of a limp woman with long curly hair is seen drifting underwater, and a voiceover questions the end of a life that never truly existed. This life ended in murder, the victim herself unsure of who her killer was and why she was killed. Her death was only metaphorical, for in her place a new life begins.\n\nThe story starts with Patience Phillips (Halle Berry), a timid woman who can't stand up for herself. She lets people walk all over her, and has wasted her artistic talent working for a cosmetic company as a graphic designer. George Hedare (Lambert Wilson) runs the company with his supermodel wife, Laurel (Sharon Stone). Laurel knows that Patience is capable, but seems mostly indifferent, only using her in own power struggles with her husband. George, an abusive boss in general, finds plenty of opportunity to mock Laurel.\n\nThe company is about to launch BeauLine, a new anti-aging product that Laurel had secretly been using for years. The advertisement is designed by Patience but George, unsatisfied, demands that she redesigns it. Upset and frustrated, Patience returns home and sees a cat looking up at her. Shaking her head, she goes to sleep, but her loud neighbours keeps her up and she is unable to rest. Next morning, the cat is on her window ledge. When she approaches, she realizes the cat has climbed up to a higher ledge and was potentially stuck. To try and reach the cat, Patience climbs out her window ledge, and a passing detective mistakens her intentions as suicidal. He ends up rushing into her apartment and pulling her back in. Patience would have thanked him but realizes she is late for work, in her hurry to leave she drops her wallet. The detective, Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt), tracks her down to her workplace and returns it to her, and both agree to a coffee date.\n\nLater that night, Patience goes to the production factory to deliver her artwork, and she accidentally hears that the BeauLine has unsafe health problems. Stunned, she backs into several tools, revealling her presence. Two men chase her into a large waste water pipe, where she is trapped, and they flush her into the river, where she drowns. The cat that has been appearing in front of Patience appears by her body and gathers several other cats around her.\n\nPatience eventually drags herself unsteadily up and returns home. Her movements are off and uncontrollable, and she ends up breaking the glass through her own window. When her neighbours start their usual loud party again, she yells at them to quiet but they again ignore her. The old Patience would have backed down, but now she strodes down, knocks on their door, and promptly beats up the host and destroys the music equipment in front of many shocked guests. When she wakes up the next morning, she almost dismisses everything as a dream until she sees the broken glass. Unfortunately, her memories of what happened before that are blank, and so she cluelessly returns back to work.\n\nAt work, George loudly yells at Patience in front of all her coworkers for not handling in her project. She tunes him out, which angers him further, and when she apologizes he only continues. Patience than apologizes for wasting her time in the company, and is fired, but as soon as George leaves her colleagues swarm around her in congratulations. Patience packs up her things and while she and her friends are walking home, two dogs instantly begin barking at her and she instinctively hisses at them. When questioned, she explains her behaviour as allergies. When they pass by a jewelry store, Patience's attention is caught by a beautiful collar-like necklace, but is reminded of her new unemployed status and leaves longingly. Once home, she sees the same cat again, and finally close enough she was able to find the address on the cat's owner.\n\nThe cat belonged to an older woman named Ophelia, a former professor who lived alone in a house full of cats. She explains that the cat constantly appearing in front of Patience is named Midnight, a rare Egyptian Mau who likely has been watching Patience for several days, knowing that she was about to die. The cat has special powers that are given only to a few deserving women after they die. Hence after Patience died, she is reborn with new catlike powers. History will tell of women with the senses and agility of a cat, and Patience has now joined their ranks. Patience and Catwoman are two completely different people, yet they are one.\n\nNow on the prowl, Patience digs up a leather outfit she once received as a gift but never wore, and donned on the cat mask Ophelia gives her. Catwoman finds the man who had tried to shoot before drowning Patience, but after a fight she learns he had no idea who the girl he killed even was or exactly why he had been suddenly called in to eliminate her. He only knows it was something to do with the company, perhaps some sort of corporate scandal, and that she should probably check with the people at the top. Catwoman agrees and goes to corporate headquarters, only to find another man she had seen on the night of her death lying dead on the floor. A passing janitor walks into the scene and mistakens Catwoman as the man's murderer, she is forced to flee when the police are summoned.\n\nNow a wanted criminal to the public, Catwoman sneaks into George's private residence, where she briefly gets into a fight with Laurel. Catwoman demands to know where George is, telling Laurel about the terrible effects of BeauLine. Laurel gives Catwoman a hotel address as well as a cell phone so the two of them could keep in contact. Catwoman finds George with Drina, another upcoming model, in a private balcony watching a dance. Unfortunately, a security officer had already spotted Catwoman and called the police. When Drina briefly leaves and Catwoman tries to interrogate an uncooperative and still abusive George, she is cut short by the police suddenly appearing. Left with no choice, she jumps off the balcony and onto the stage before briefly dropping down below. The audience mistakens her brief appearance as part of the show and loudly applaud while below, Catwoman finds Tom with a gun. The two of them fight while she flirts and even kisses him before reinforcements arrive and Catwoman is again forced to flee.\n\nOn their date, Tom tells Patience about his encounter with Catwoman. She doesn't seem jealous, and the two continue having a great time until Tom finds a diamond-studded claw in Patience's home, something he instantly recognizes as part of Catwoman. He takes a cup Patience had drank from to the police lab, where analysis prove Patience and Catwoman as the same person. Meanwhile, Patience wakes up alone in the bed, and receives a call from Laurel who says she found evidence of her husband's crimes. Catwoman goes to the Hedare residence only to fall for a trap - George had been clawed at and fatally shot, and Laurel tosses the gun into Catwoman's hands so that the police would identify her as the killer.\n\nHer agility and Laurel's exercise outfit helps Patience escape the police and allows her to return home, but Tom is waiting for her. He knows if she wanted to she could quickly disarm him, but she doesn't and lets him arrest her and bring her into interrogation. Patience pleads her case and tries to explain, but as Tom pointed out all the evidence pointed to Catwoman as the killer. Patience realizes that Tom probably still saw her as the girl from his first impression - a crazy woman with suicidal or even hallucinatory tendencies. In tears, she allows him to lock her in the detention cell, but it only takes the appearance of Midnight for her to successfully escape. She ends up going to BeauLine's production warehouse and disabling all the trucks so that the merchandise could not be delievered.\n\nTom goes to the BeauLine press conference where Laurel is heavily promoting the producting and giving out free samples. He privately takes her aside and indicates that he had evidence about her crimes, and when she unintentionally confesses he is unprepared for her murderous reaction. Luckily Catwoman arrives in time, but Tom is already injured and unable to run quickly out the building. Instead they are forced to stay behind to fight Laurel and her lackeys. Despite his injured state Tom is able to take care of himself, and Catwoman fights her way to Laurel for a final confrontation. To her dismay, it turns out that Laurel is unable to feel pain, largely due to the continuous use of BeauLine. Nevertheless, Catwoman manages to damage skin and eventually causes Laurel to plunge out the window. For the first time, Catwoman realizes she may have killed someone.\n\nCatwoman's exploits end up on the news, and the Hedra company is shut down, but partially because of the ambigous nature of Catwoman and partially out of guilt Patience is unable to relax. She breaks up with Tom and prepares to live her own life, free and untamed, the Catwoman of her generation."

    "Cell 211": "Juan Oliver wants to make a good impression at his new job as a prison officer and reports to work a day early, leaving his pregnant wife, Elena, at home. During his tour of the prison, an accident occurs that knocks him unconscious. He is rushed to the empty but visibly haunted walls of cell 211. As this diversion unfolds, convicts break free and hijack control of the penitentiary. Aware of the violence that is to come, the prison officers flee, leaving Juan stranded and unconscious in the heart of the riot. When Juan awakens, he immediately takes stock of the situation; in order to survive, he must pretend to be a prisoner.\n\nJuan manages to convince the other prisoners that he is one of them, and that he just entered the prison that very day for homicide. He not only makes himself believed as inmate, but befriends the violent, deep voiced leader of the riot, Malamadre (Badmother in English), who takes him under his wing.\n\nMalamadre discovers that Basque terrorists associated with ETA are being held in the same prison, and plans to use them as a bargaining tool. When this hits the news, it triggers a stream of prison riots throughout the country as well as demonstrations in the Basque Country. Juan quickly realizes that he is on his own as the situation becomes more politicized and the government gets involved, afraid of potential ramifications in the Basque community.\n\nJuan's pregnant wife, Elena, slowly learns about his impossible situation and heads for the jail. Once there she is brutally beaten outside the prison, while trying to get information about her husband. A TV inside the prison cell block reveals the information to the prisoners. Camera footage indicates that Elena was at the riot. Fearful for her safety, Juan insists on learning information regarding her status.\n\nMalamadre demands information of all those injured by the riot. The authorities respond with a short list of only four names. This infuriates the prisoners, who believe that the police are withholding information, and decide to kill one of the ETA prisoners. However, Juan intervenes and suggest they merely cut off an ear, an act he is forced to perform himself.\n\nThe authorities then provide additional information on all the injured. Juan learns Elena is in the hospital, though he is told she is recovering. Juan insists on talking to her but is rebuffed. Utrilla, the police guard who hit Elena, is suspended and asked to leave. Meanwhile, Apache learns the truth behind Juan's status as a guard, having contacted a friend at the police via a secret cell phone. He tells Juan he will give Juan a chance to defend himself before letting Malamadre know.\n\nLater, Malamadre has Apache tell Juan that he needs to speak to him. Juan is brought to a secluded room, the door closed behind him, and several of Malamadre's men surround him. He asks, nervously, \"What's up?\" in an effort to defuse the situation given his worry that Apache betrayed his true status. Instead, Malamadre shows Juan a cell phone video from a different camera at the outside riot. The footage shows that Elena was beaten by Utrilla, another prison guard, who then proceeded to leave her on the ground. Juan insists that Utrilla be brought inside.\n\nInside, Utrilla is faced with the cell phone footage by an infuriated Juan. Juan again insists on talking to Elena, but he instead learns that both she and her unborn child have died. In response, the prisoners viciously beat Utrilla until he loudly insists that Juan is a prison guard. He asks Juan to tell the truth; instead, Juan slits Utrilla's throat and fully joins the prisoners in their fight, having lost all will and reason for life outside. In private Malamadre and his other cohorts are furious but Malamadre leaves him alone, given that he ruthlessly killed Utrilla. Juan proceeds to his cell and attempts to commit suicide by hanging himself with a belt. He fails as the belt breaks under his weight.\n\nMalamadre receives a call from the negotiator asking him to collect a file. They tell him that Juan Oliver is a prison guard and leave the file for Malamadre to see. Malamadre says it is only a piece of paper and heads back inside telling the negotiator that they are just trying to make him kill Juan.\n\nThe government sends a messenger to deal directly with the prisoners. The government acquiesces to Malamadre's demands. However, Juan drags Utrilla's corpse in front of the liaison and insists that the government make the agreement public or they will kill the ETA prisoners. Malamadre is furious at being upstaged though he understands that Juan is correct. Malamadre tells Juan that if the GEO team invades instead of agreeing, then he will either die or kill Juan. In either event, Malamadre insists only one of them will live, as punishment for Juan's betrayal.\n\nThe government does not agree to the demands and sends in the GEO team. Apache kills Juan and severely injures Malamadre, and it is unclear if he will become the new prison king or if Malamadre, as soon as he will heal from his injuries, will exact vengeance upon him. At an inquiry held by the government, the prison officials regret Juan's death but did the best they could in the situation. Finally, the prison official simply asks, \"Any more questions?\""

    "Cellular": "The film opens with Jessica Martin, a high school biology teacher, talking to her son Ricky, while escorting him to the school bus. After she returns home, mysterious assailants enter her home through the back door, kill her house maid, kidnap her and confine her in the attic of their safe house. Ethan, the gang leader, smashes the only telephone in the attic to prevent her from contacting anyone. She has no idea who the kidnappers are or what they want. She pieces together the broken phone to randomly make a connection. She finally reaches the cell phone of Ryan who has just been dumped by his girlfriend for being too irresponsible. He takes it as a joke, but Jessica persuades him to go to the police. At the police station, Officer Mooney tells him to go to the detectives on the fourth floor. He begins to lose the signal in the stairwell, and must turn back to avoid losing the connection.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethan returns to the safehouse and asks Jessica about something she doesn't know. When Jessica tells him that she doesn't know, he tells her that he is going to get her son. Ryan, who overhears them, realizes how serious the kidnapping situation is. After Ethan leaves, she tells Ryan to get to her son's school before they do. Unfortunately, he is too late and her son, Ricky, is kidnapped and he quickly chases them by stealing a car owned by a school security officer. Because his cell phone's battery is dying, he drives to a shop for a charger. After being repeatedly redirected from counter to counter, he uses a gun from the security vehicle to hold up the store at gun-point to obtain the device.\n\nSgt. Mooney, meanwhile, decides to check on the kidnapping claim that he received. He uses the Department of Motor Vehicles records to find the address of Jessica, but when he comes to her house, a woman meets him, telling him that she is Jessica and that everything is fine. Believing it to be a false alarm, he leaves. It is revealed that the woman is Dana Bayback, an accomplice of the kidnappers.\n\nEthan returns to the safe house and asks Jessica for the location of a place called \"The Left Field\", where her husband, Craig, was. Ethan then shows that he has imprisoned Ricky in the garage and threatens to kill him if Jessica does not tell him what this this information means. She tells him that Left Field is a bar in the LAX airport. As he leaves, she tells Ryan that they have gone to get her husband. Suddenly a cross-connection between phone lines threatens the carrier signal. A lawyer talking to his mother breaks in. Ryan is able to find the lawyer and steal his car and phone, since his phone was cut off from Jessica's and the security car was just destroyed by an oncoming vehicle. She tells him to head for LAX and find her husband. At the airport, he tries to stop the kidnappers by planting the security firearm in the bag of one of them as they go through security, but when they are apprehended, they reveal that they are cops. This causes Ryan and Jessica to realize that Ethan and his gang are dirty police officers. Ryan then finds a man that apparently matches Jessica's description of her husband Craig, but this mistake in identity permits the kidnappers to apprehend the real Craig.\n\nOn exiting the airport, he finds that the lawyer's car has been impounded. Meanwhile, a series of bizarre incidents have snaked their way into the news, including the one about a gunman who took a mobile charger and overpaid for it and an interview with the lawyer who states that his car was stolen by a man claiming it was to rescue a woman named Jessica Martin. Mooney sees the news and identifies Ryan. He calls Jessica's home and gets the voice mail, but this time notices that Jessica's voice on the answering machine is very different from the accented voice of the woman who claimed to be her.\n\nCraig is brought into the attic and forced to reveal the location of a videotape. He tells them that it is at Centurion Bank in his safe deposit box, but that they need him to retrieve it. Before they leave, Jessica acts a little fanatical to whisper in secret to Craig that he will have help at the bank. Ethan and his friends Dimitri and Deason go with Craig while another kidnapper stays on guard. Ryan also reaches the bank. The kidnappers retrieve the video-camera, but Ryan knocks down Dimitri, takes the camera, and flees to roof alone after failing to take Craig with him. However, he accidentally drops the lawyer's cell phone off the roof, smashing it to pieces. He manages to escape in a taxi-cab, telling the driver to go to the LAPD Auto Impound. In the cab, he checks out the camera. He sees that when Craig was taking some video footage of houses for his realtor job, Craig accidentally shot footage of Los Angeles Police Department Detectives Ethan, Mad Dog, Dimitri, Bayback, Deason, and Jack Tanner, a friend of Mooney, robbing and murdering drug dealers (which is a good thing that Ryan left the police station when he did, as the detective that Mooney was sending him to was in fact Tanner). After getting off at the impound lot and sneaking in while the receptionist is distracted by the lawyer trying to get his car back without paying a fee, Ryan steals the lawyer's car again and gets back his own cellphone, relieved to find that Jessica's call is still on hold.\n\nMooney returns to the Martin residence, where Bayback shoots at him, injuring him. He retaliates and kills her, but learns to his dismay that she was a cop, too. Meanwhile, Mad Dog stumbles upon the phone line Jessica is using from the downstairs phone, and Jessica is forced to kill him by cutting his brachial artery before he could kill her causing him to bleed out in seconds. She attempts to escape with her son, but Ethan returns with Craig as a hostage and stops her. He is angry with her, wanting to know who that kid at the bank was. Before Ethan can do anything, Ryan uses his cell phone's memory to contact Ethan and makes a deal directly over the phone: the video tape in exchange for the Martin family. Upon learning of the meeting, Tanner convinces Mooney to delay his trip to the hospital for stitches, so that he can identify Ryan, who Mooney still thinks of as a prime suspect.\n\nThe deal goes down at the Santa Monica Pier. Ryan tries to handle it his way in disguise, but his ex-girlfriend accidentally exposes him, after which Mooney is able to finger him. While Tanner sends Dimitri to help Mooney get needed medical attention, he takes Ryan to Ethan. Ethan destroys the video recording and Tanner radios the order to kill the Martins, although Deason in the van suggests to wait until they get to the safe house. However, Mooney overhears the radio transmission from Dimitri's radio and he realizes that Tanner is one of the kidnappers. Ryan escapes following a distraction from his friend Chad, while Dmitri attempts to kill Mooney, but Mooney overpowers and handcuffs him. Tanner and Ethan confront Ryan in a boathouse, where Ryan knocks out Tanner with a surfboard, but Ethan beats him up with his superior fighting skills until Mooney intervenes. After a brief cat and mouse game, Ryan, wounded, notices that Ethan has circled behind Mooney, and helps Mooney by calling Ethan's cell phone (revealing that Ryan's phone somehow was not water damaged after jumping into the river). The ring of the cell betrays Ethan's hiding place, and Mooney promptly shoots him dead. As Ethan falls, he looks dumbfoundedly at Ryan ... and then at Ryan's cell phone, the \"weapon\" that got him killed just before passing away.\n\nWhile this was going on, Jessica manages to strangle Deason with her handcuff chain from the rear of their van, then free her husband and son. But Deason was merely stunned, and aims his gun at them. Then Ryan suddenly intervenes and smashes him around till he's unconscious.\n\nWhile Ryan and Mooney are being treated by medics, Tanner is also exposed, because Ryan had made a copy of the videocam recording onto his cell phone, and the Martin family is set free. Jessica finally gets to meet the man who has risked his life saving her and her family. Ryan jokingly requests for her is never to call him again, and they laugh."

    "Center of the Web": "When drama teacher John Phillips (Ted Prior) is mistaken for a professional assassin named John Logan, he is ordered into a vehicle and taken to see former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent Stephen Moore (Tony Curtis). En route, shots are fired into the vehicle causing it to crash. Police arrive and arrest John Phillips. John's girl friend, Assistant District Attorney Kathryn Lockwood (Charlene Tildon), posts his bail, and after he is released, John is approached by U.S. Department of Justice agent Richard Morgan (Robert Davi). Morgan explains that John Logan was hired to assassinate a government official, but he was recently found murdered. He orders John Phillips, under threat of imprisonment, to assume Logan's identity and stop the assassination attempt. John reluctantly agrees. Worried, Kathryn telephones her deceased father's close friend, Stephen Moore, unaware of Moore's connection to John Logan, and confides in him about John's impersonation.\n\nMeanwhile, John Phillips checks into Logan's hotel room, and receives instructions to go to an abandoned steel mill. Armed with a gun, John is attacked by three men upon his arrival. As he fights back, Moore's associate, Tony (William Zipp), appears and announces that he passed the test.\n\nReturning to the hotel, John looks up to see a rifle in the window of his hotel room pointed at the entrance of a convention center across the street. While running upstairs, John hears a gunshot. He arrives to find his room empty, and looks out the window to see Governor Wilson of Georgia lying dead on the ground.\n\nAfterward, John tells Agent Morgan that Logan was not hired to kill the governor, but to be framed for the crime. As they talk, Tony appears and shoots at them. In time, John goes to Kathryn's house and tells her he has been working as an undercover agent for the Department of Justice, and informs Kathryn that she is a suspect in the murder of Governor Wilson, as she made no secret of blaming the governor for her father's suicide years earlier.\n\nLater, Kathryn telephones Moore for help. When he arrives, John accuses him of being behind the governor's assassination and planning to frame Kathryn for the crime. Kathryn is unconvinced that Moore had a hand in the conspiracy, until John announces that Moore murdered her father and made it look like a suicide, on orders from the CIA. After Stephen Moore confesses to killing Kathryn's father, Agent Morgan appears and holds Moore at gunpoint. However, Kathryn draws her own gun and kills Moore."

    "Central Intelligence": "In 1996, extremely popular student and star athlete Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart) is being honored at his high school's Senior Assembly. Halfway through Joyner's speech, Trevor Olson (Jason Bateman) and a group of bullies grab young Robbie Wierdicht (Sione Kelepi) who is showering, and throw him into the hall where the Senior Assembly is taking place. Everybody except Joyner and his girlfriend (Maggie, Danielle Nicolet) laugh, and Wierdicht exits the hall completely embarrassed and using Calvin's jacket to cover himself.\n\nTwenty years later, Calvin is married to Maggie and works as an accountant. He is dissatisfied with his career, while Maggie is thriving as a partner at her law firm. She suggests they see a therapist to salvage their deteriorating marriage. At work, Calvin receives a friend request on Facebook from a man named Bob Stone, who reveals that he is Robbie and requests that they meet at a bar. Calvin is shocked to see that Robbie (Dwayne Jhonson) has transformed into a tall, muscular, confident man. Robbie easily defeats a group of four men that try to bully them. As Bob drops Calvin off at his house, he asks Calvin to review a few accounting records, saying he has payroll issues. Calvin deciphers the records as multi-million-dollar transactions from an auction, with the final payment set to be made the following day. Bob avoids Calvin's questions and ends up spending the night on his couch.\n\nThe next morning, a group of CIA agents led by Pamela Harris (Amy Ryan) arrive at Calvin's house in search of Bob, who escapes after erasing all evidence of his presence. Pam warns Calvin that Bob is a dangerous rogue agent who has the intention of selling satellite codes to the highest bidder. As the CIA agents follow Calvin to his office, Bob successfully abducts Calvin and explains that he is trying to stop a criminal known as the Black Badger from selling the satellite codes, but needs Calvin's skills as a forensic accountant to find the coordinates of the deal's location. They are then attacked by a bounty hunter; during the attack, Calvin flees and calls Maggie, telling her to meet him at the marriage counselor's office. Pam intercepts him and informs him that Bob murdered his partner Phil Stanton and is the Black Badger himself. She warns him to refrain from telling Maggie and gives him a device to alert them to Bob's location. Calvin then arrives for marriage counseling, where he finds Bob posing as the marriage counselor, who he has trapped in the closet.\n\nBob convinces Calvin to help him, and Calvin sets up a meeting with Trevor so they can obtain the account number that reveals the deal's location. Trevor helps them and lies that he's found God, apologizing for the prank, only to laugh in their faces, bullying Bob once again. As they leave the building, Pam calls Calvin and threatens to arrest Maggie if he fails to help them detain Bob. Calvin is forced to betray Bob and the CIA arrests him. As Pam tortures Bob to get him to confess, a guilt-ridden Calvin decides to help Bob. He restrains Harris in her own handcuffs, and the two manage to escape successfully. Calvin deduces that the deal is happening in Boston and helps Bob steal a plane. Halfway through the flight, Bob fakes to Joyner that the vehicle has run out of fuel and they will die, which forces Calvin to reveal that he should've given Maggie a child. At a park in Boston, Calvin guesses that the deal must be happening in an underground parking garage. Bob tells Calvin to stay outside and enters the garage alone. However, when he sees Pam entering the garage a short while later, Calvin mistakenly assumes that she is the Black Badger and runs after her. He finds Bob meeting with the buyer and claiming to be the Black Badger. Bob shoots Calvin, grazing his neck and knocking him backwards into a stairwell, to keep him safe.\n\nPhil (Aaron Paul) arrives, revealing that he is alive, and claims that he is the real Black Badger. The buyer attempts to retrieve codes from both Bob and Phil, but the CIA arrives, and a shootout begins, while Calvin grabs both codes and runs outside. He encounters Bob and Phil, who engage in combat. Unable to decide who is the criminal, Calvin aims blindly and shoots Bob, allowing Phil to knock him out. Phil then confesses to being the Black Badger and reveals that Bob is innocent. Before Phil can kill Calvin, he causes a distraction and allows Bob to rip Phil's throat out, killing him. The two deliver the codes to Pam, who then drops them off to their high school reunion. Calvin reconciles with Maggie, and, alongside Bob, they walk in to the reunion. Bob is announced as the Homecoming King, with Calvin revealing to Maggie that he hacked the voting system to ensure Bob's win. Trevor attempts to bully Bob again, but Bob knocks him out. As Bob delivers his speech, he relives his most embarrassing high-school moment and takes off all his clothes confidently. He walks off stage to unite with his high school crush Darla (Melissa McCarthy) and they share a kiss.\n\nDuring the ending credits, Maggie is revealed to be pregnant, and Calvin has joined the CIA. As a gift for his first day, Bob returns to Calvin his varsity jacket from high school."

    "Centurion": "It is A.D. 117 and the Roman garrisons are struggling to contain the Picts, the Celtic inhabitants of the Scottish Highlands. The Picts under their king, Gorlacon, are perfecting guerilla warfare and are eliminating Roman outposts one by one. Centurion Quintus Dias is the only survivor of a Pictish raid and is taken prisoner. In the meantime, the Roman governor of Britannia wants to obtain favour with the central administration, hoping to secure a transfer back to the comforts of Rome. He dispatches the Ninth Legion to the front under General Titus Flavius Virilus, providing him with a mute female Brigantian scout, Etain.\n\nAs the legion marches north, they encounter and save Dias, who has escaped. Etain betrays the legion to Gorlacon: the Romans walk into a trap and are annihilated. Dias, with six others, elude death and capture. They learn that Virilus has been taken prisoner and set out to rescue him. They find the Pictish settlement and sneak in at night, but fail to break the general's chains. As they retreat, one of them kills Gorlacon's young son. The next morning, after the dead boy is burned, the general is given a sword and made to duel with Etain, who kills him.\n\nThe seven decide to return south via a long detour over the mountains, while Etain with a Pict detachment are sent on horseback to track and kill them, in revenge for the king's son. They eventually catch up with the fugitives, who have to jump off a cliff and into a stream. One is killed by arrows while two separate, pursued by wolves. Dias and his best fighter attempt a night raid on the Pictish camp, while Etain and her warriors do the same. Several men are killed. Dias and his two followers happen upon a hut in the forest and befriend Arianne, who lives there. She shelters them and when Etain comes, she confronts her while the Romans hide under the floorboards. The next morning they leave Arianne and find the closest garrison abandoned: an order on a wall informs them that Roman troops have retreated south, to Hadrian's Wall. As they see Etain approach, they set up a trap inside the fort. A battle ensues, Dias kills Etain, and he and one wounded companion emerge victorious. By chance they reunite with one of their lost companions, who earlier killed Gorlacon's son, and wounded another Roman soldier to leave as bait for a pack of wolves hunting them. Upon reaching Hadrian's Wall, the lost companion worries Dias, who says that he will report his crimes and the two men fight with Dias as the victor. Dias' other companion, in Pictish clothing, is shot by Roman soldiers by mistake. When Dias enters the camp he reports the situation to the governor. The governor has decided to have all Ninth Legion veterans killed, so that his record is not tainted by a military failure. The governor's daughter is trusted with making sure that Dias is also killed. Dias evades the attempt on his life and returns to Arianne in the forest."

    "Chaalbaaz": "Born as twin sisters, Anju (Sridevi) and Manju (Sridevi) are separated immediately after birth thanks to their mentally handicapped nanny Madhumati (Aruna Irani). Anju ends up with her uncle Tribhuvan (Anupam Kher) and Tribhuvan's sister-in-law Amba (Rohini Hattangadi), while Manju is raised in a slum environment. Their parents were killed in a car accident (when Anju was 10 yrs old) orchestrated by Tribhuvan. However, in their will, they declare that their daughters will inherit their wealth once the twins turns 21 (if they die before that, the wealth goes into a trust). This results in Tribhuvan and Amba bringing Anju up as a coy and easily frightened girl (by giving her regular drug injections), merely keeping her alive so she can sign off the property in their name. The house servant Lokesh \"Dadda\" Sharma (Annu Kapoor), Anju's younger brother Raja (Aftab Shivdasani) and a pet dog sympathize with her plight.\n\nAnju likes classical dance and is unable to resist the urge to dance whenever she hears Indian classical music. On his birthday, Tribhuvan hosts a grand party. Among the several guests attending is his friend Vishwanath (Saeed Jaffrey), who is generally kind towards Anju. When Indian classical music plays at the party, Anju is unable to resist and bursts out dancing but ends up accidentally slapping Tribhuvan. Although calm at the party, he beats Anju mercilessly with a whip the next day.\n\nOn the other hand, Manju grows up in a slum as a happy-go-lucky and street smart stage dancer. She spends her days tricking people in the village to forgo her loans and is childhood friends with her neighbor and taxi driver Jackie \"Jaggu\" Pandyekar (Rajnikanth). Madhumati is in a mental hospital and Manju's truth has not yet been revealed to her. One night she crashes into a bar to drink beer where she meets and flirts with Suraj (Sunny Deol), Viswanath's son. Suraj soon falls for her. Vishwanath has been pestering Suraj to get married for a while now and one day, when he shows him Anju's photo as a prospective marriage offer, he agrees, mistaking her to be Manju. When they visit Tribhuvan's place with their offer, Anju doesn't recognize Suraj and has a panic attack (courtesy of the injections given to her by Amba), which scare Suraj and Vishwanath away.\n\nThe reason Tribhuvan and Amba refuse to attend to marriage offers for Anju is because they want to get her married to Amba's brother Batuknath Lallanprasad Maalpani a.k.a. Balma (Shakti Kapoor). They call Balma to live with them, who soon begins harassing Anju and kills her pet dog when he leaps to her defense. Terrified at the turn of events, Anju runs away from home. On her way, she is harassed by strangers until Suraj saves her. That same day, Manju has a fight with Jaggu and she sets off on her own path. In a twist of fate, their paths end up crossing and while the two never meet, they end up exchanging places. Thus, an injured Suraj is brought to Anju's house by Manju (who was seen on the streets by Tribhuvan and Abma), while Anju ends up at Manju's slum with Jaggu.\n\nManju falls in love with Suraj. Manju is easily able to assert control over Tribhuvan, Amba and Balma. While the trio mistake her for Anju and assume her to be weak, Manju surprises them by displaying strength and aggression and has them under control. Meanwhile, Anju starts getting close to Jaggu, who starts falling for the new \"Manju\". The new \"Manju\" is shy, clean, cultured and an ideal wife. He proposes marriage to her, to which she agrees. Suraj sees Anju with Jaggu and thinks Manju is two-timing them and breaks up with her.\n\nThe two sisters live their life comfortably until one day, Balma spots Anju at Manju's place and deduces that the one in their house is her twin sister Manju. He hatches a plan and kidnaps Anju, taking her to a bungalow at Alibaug. One of Jaggu's friends overhears Balma speaking to Tribhuvan on the phone and informs Manju, Suraj and Jaggu, who finally understand what's going on. They arrive at the bungalow where Tribhuvan forces Anju to drink poison (after signing the will transferring all assets to Tribhuvan, on her 21st birthday) and also has their nanny captive. Suraj, Manju and Jaggu fight Tribhuvan's goons and save Anju, who finally gets to share a tender moment with Manju. She is taken to the hospital and survives.\n\nFinally, Suraj marries Manju while Jaggu end up with Anju and they live happily ever after.

    "Chain Lightning": "A few years after being discharged from the military, the now broke and bored Matt Brennan met old Army Air Force buddy Hinkle and was subsequently offered a job as the chief test pilot of an experimental jet plane JA-3, and found himself reunited with the ghosts from his past.\n\nThe project was fully sponsored by tycoon Leland Willis, and developed by Carl Troxell, an aviation scientist who had tagged along on Matts last B-29 mission and remained highly impressed by his experience and field knowledge. Also coming back into Matts life is old flame Jo Holloway, now Willis' secretary, with whom Matt had a serious relationship during the war, but purposely lost touch with due to his disillusionment with the post-war civilian life.\n\nWillis wanted a working JA-3 as soon as possible, so that he could get both fame and fortune; Carl, on the other hand, believed that JA-3 could not be considered complete without safety measures for the pilot. Matt saw a chance for grabs and came up with a plan that would get Willis what he wanted - a record-breaking flight from Nome to Washington DC, via the North Pole, to impress the government - at the cost of $30,000.\n\nCarl was disappointed by Matt's lack of concern for human beings and became determined to complete building the escape pod he had been developing and test fly the JA-4 (JA-3 equipped with the escape pod) before Matt was to land in Washington DC. He died trying.\n\nMatt's record-breaking flight was a success and he now had enough money to marry Jo and settle down. Carl's death and dying message brought back his conscience. He decided to use the JA-4 and test Carls theory by flying it for the official government demonstration."

    "Chain Reaction": "Eddie Kasalivich (Keanu Reeves) is a student machinist working with a team from the University of Chicago to obtain energy from water. They have been trying for quite some time without success but Eddie, while working at home, discovers the secret to successfully obtain energy from burning hydrogen, leaving only water as a residue. The next day in the lab, the machine is perfected by Eddie and everything appears to be working and stable. To celebrate, a party is thrown in the lab. That night after the party, project physicist Dr. Lily Sinclair (Rachael Weisz) tries to leave the lab but her car battery is dead. Eddie offers to take her home as she is obviously intoxicated, so they walk off in search of a taxi. Back in the lab, Drs. Alistair Barkley and Lu Chen are on their computers while a van is seen driving towards the lab. Chen hears a noise and goes to investigate, but is kidnapped by unknown assailants as Alistair also comes under attack.\n\nMeanwhile, Lily and Eddie arrive at her house and after making sure she is okay, Eddie heads back to the lab to get his bike. As he arrives at the lab, he sees a suspicious van driving away and detects alarms coming from the lab. He runs inside to find Alistair with a plastic bag over his head (Eddie is unable to revive him) and Chen nowhere to be found. The hydrogen reactor is on and dangerously unstable so Eddie goes over to the computers to try to stabilize the reaction, but is locked out of the system. Realizing the reactor is going to blow, Eddie runs out, jumps on his bike and speeds away as a concealed detonator triggers a massive explosion that destroys the lab and surrounding streets, eight blocks total. As rescue crews arrive, Eddie is questioned by the police and later the FBI about what happened the night of the blast. Upon returning with Lily to their homes, they soon come to suspect that they are being framed as fake evidence is planted in both of their houses.\n\nBoth go on the run and head to an observatory belonging to Maggie McDermott, an old friend of Eddie's. After resting up they contact Paul Shannon (Morgan Freeman), the man funding the project (along with DARPA), but are almost caught in the process and barely manage to escape. As Eddie and Lily are evading more police, Paul meets with Lyman Earl Collier (Cox) at C-Systems Research complex to discuss the current events. It becomes apparent that the plot to destroy the lab and frame Eddie and Lily for it was orchestrated by this company, and that Lyman is the one who ordered the attack on the lab. Despite some disagreement, Paul and Lyman decide to continue the hunt for Eddie and Lily, a task made easier when Eddie sends a coded message to Paul requesting another place to meet. At this new rendezvous, Paul reveals he was the one who framed Eddie. The meeting ends in an ambush, and Lily is captured as Eddie barely escapes.\n\nBy tracing the license plate on the van used in the ambush, Eddie is able to track them to the C-Systems Research facility where Lily and Chen are being held. When C-Systems' test reactor fails again, Paul, the scientists and the prisoners all leave the room, so Eddie takes the opportunity to \"fix\" the system. The next morning, one of the other scientists discovers the working reactor and everyone celebrates. Paul is suspicious, and immediately obtains a download of the fusion data, and secretly gives it to his assistant, Anita, for safekeeping. He then finds Eddie at a computer in the company board room. There, Eddie demands to be let go in exchange for making the reactor work. Paul agrees but Lyman refuses, believing that the reactor already works, so Eddie sets the reactor to explode while sending proof of his innocence to the FBI and blueprints of the reactor to \"hopefully a couple thousand\" international scientists.\n\nLyman responds by shooting Chen dead, then leaving both Eddie and Lily to die in the explosion as he, Paul, and their staff flee the site, setting lock-down doors on the way. As the base self-destructs and Eddie and Lily manage to (in a feat of ingenuity) make their escape from the reactor room, Lyman is given a fake copy of the fusion data. Paul then shoots Lyman for overstepping the bounds of the program, leaving his body in an elevator to be incinerated in the ensuing inferno. During his own escape, Paul deactivates the containment, letting Eddie and Lily escape. As he is doing this, Eddie and Lily struggle with security over an ascending construction lift, ending in Eddie and Lily climbing aboard it, moments before a blast wave sweeps into the tunnel. Both Eddie and Lily survive the shock-wave to be met by FBI now convinced of their innocence, who take them to safety. Paul departs the scene via chauffeured sedan. He is last seen dictating a memo to Anita. The memo informs the Director of CIA that C-System is \"...no longer a viable entity. Will be in contact.\""

    "Chandni Chowk to China": "Hojo is a tyrant who has enslaved an entire village in China and is selling their ancient treasures for private profit. Hojo is ruthless and a warrior of unmatched expertise. The villagers look for a savior in the light of ancient Chinese defender Liu Shen, who sacrificed his life, defending his country and his people. The village priest studies ancient scriptures to determine that Liu Shen has been reborn in a different country.\n\nSidhesh Sharma aka Sidhu (Akshay Kumar) is a lowly vegetable cutter at a roadside food stall in the Chandni Chowk section of Delhi, who consults astrologers, tarot card readers, and fake fakirs (he is very unlucky and wants to change his destiny) despite his foster father Dada's (Mithun Chakraborty) exhortations. When two strangers from China claim him as a reincarnation of war hero 'Liu Shen', Sidhu encouraged by trickster Chopstick (Ranvir Shorey) (having the knowledge of both Chinese and Indian scriptures) (the Chinese have to use Chopstick's services as Sidhu does not speak Chinese), believes he will be feted as a hero in China. Chopsticks knows that the Chinese want Sidhu to defeat Hojo (Gordon Liu), but hides this from Sidhu, as he will never agree to go if he finds out that he is supposed to fight a brutal mobster.\n\nSidhu travels to China with Chopstick (after begging Dada to let him go, even though Dada disagrees with Sidhu). Along the way (at the Chinese embassy), he meets Sakhi (Deepika Padukone), the Indian-Chinese spokes-model known as Ms. Tele Shoppers Media, or Ms. TSM, who also appears in Tele shopping ads in China. Sakhi steals Sidhu token for the visa appointment and leaves him stranded. Sakhi's twin sister Suzy, known as the lady assassin Meow Meow, works for Hojo (Gordon Liu) as a smuggler of diamonds, not knowing Hojo tried to kill her father, Inspector Chiang (Roger Yuan). Sakhi is travelling to China to meet her suppliers and to find her lost sister Suzy/Meow Meow. In their childhood, Hojo had attacked Chiang, and his family at the great wall of China, after Chiang tried to arrest Hojo. In the attack Chiang jumps from the wall when Hojo throws Suzy off, while his wife escapes with Sakhi to India. Sakhi was told by her mother that both Chiang and Suzy died. Unknown to them, Chiang is a amnesiac vagrant who lives near the great wall and Suzy works for Hojo.\n\nAt the great wall, Sakhi sees Sidhu with the villagers and decides to follow him to the village. Meanwhile Suzy sees Sidhu being worshiped as Liu Sheng (attacks Sidhu, from which he escape) and alerts Hojo. Hojo sends Suzy to kill Sidhu. Meanwhile Sakhi approaches Sidhu to apologize to him, but Sidhu thinks she is Suzy and hits her on the head and puts her in the cupboard. But then Suzy attacks Sidhu, who thinks it is Sakhi again and again overpowers her and puts her in the same cupboard again. Sakhi regains consciousness and finds Suzy next to her. But Hojo's men rescue Sakhi, thinking she is Suzy. Meanwhile Chopstick fell for Suzy and reveals to her that Sidhu is not Liu Sheng. Suzy takes Chopstik to Hojo, who figures out that Suzy has a twin sister.\n\nHojo arrives at the village with Chopstick. However, Sidhu realizes the truth about his identity (when Hojo forces Chopstik to explain the truth to Sidhu). Devastated, Sidhu apologizes to Hojo. Just then, Dada shows up (who was also captured by Hojo's men in India, and brought to China) and starts beating Hojo's men, but Hojo kills Dada, and Sidhu is exposed as a loser. Also, he is beaten (hands and legs broken) and urinated on by Hojo.\n\nHojo throws Sidhu off the great wall, but Chiang saves Sidhu. Chiang nurtures Sidhu back to health. Sakhi meanwhile escapes from Hojo and seeks CHopstick's help to rescue Suzy. Chopstick joins Hojo's gang. Sidhu figures out that Chiang can speak Hindi. Sidhu is attacked by Hojo's man Joey. Chiang helps Sidhu defeat Joey and kill him. Sidhu finds the location of Hojo, via Joey's phone and tries to attack Hojo. But Hojo is alert and easily stops Sidhu's attack. Sakhi helps Sidhu escape Hojo. Sakhi tells Sidhu about Suzy and her lost family. Thats when Chiang arrives and Sakhi realizes that Chiang is her father. Chiang sees the family photo in Sakhi's hands and his memories return. He remembers that Hojo only threw the baby blanket off the wall that day, and kept the baby (Suzy) himself.. Sidhu begs Chiang to teach him Kung-Fu. Chiang says that Sidhu will only win with the move that he has practiced thousands of time in his life, but Sidhu cant remember anything in his daily routine that fits the bill. He starts the training.\n\nChiang focuses on strengthening Sidhu's body and his arms and legs. After months of training, Sidhu is ready. Chiang and Sidhu attack Hojo's smuggling operations and kidnap his son Frankie. Hojo uses Suzy against Chiang, by telling her that Chiang is the person responsible for her father's death.\n\nWhen Hojo again meets with Sidhu (to exchange Frankie for Suzy), Suzy injures Chiang (by stabbing him); but upon seeing Sakhi, betrays Hojo (when she protects Chiang and Sakhi from Frankie). Sidhu fights Hojo in single combat, eventually using a modified vegetable-cutting technique to overpower him. After a huge fight, Sidhu finally kills Hojo. In the aftermath, Sidhu opens a vegetable stall in China but is recruited to fight for some African pygmies."

    "Changing Lanes": "A successful New York attorney, Gavin Banek (Ben Affleck), is in a rush to file a power of appointment, which will prove a rich dead man (Simon Dunn) signed his foundation over to Banek's law firm. The dead man's daughter (Mina Dunn) is opposed to Banek getting hold of the foundation as she wants to control the funds herself. Banek is under pressure from his law firm partners to bag the account.\n\nHe has a collision with another car, belonging to an insurance salesman, Doyle Gipson (Samuel L Jackson), who is also in a rush to a hearing to try to gain custody of his children and to prevent his estranged wife from taking them to Oregon.\n\nBanek tries to brush Gipson off with a blank check thereby disobeying the law. After Gipson refuses to accept the check and voices his desire to \"do the right thing\", that is, filing a police report and insurance claim, Banek strands Gipson, telling him, \"Better luck next time\". After arriving to the court late, Gipson learns that it proceeded without him and that it didn't go in his favor.\n\nUnfortunately for Banek, he dropped the crucial power of appointment file at the scene of the accident, and the judge gives him until the end of the day to re-obtain the papers and present them. Gipson, who took the papers, is in a state of dilemma on whether to return the file especially after the events of the day. On the other hand, Banek desperate to get his papers back, goes to someone skilled with computers and gets him to switch off Gipson's credit. Gipson needed credit for a loan so he could buy a house for his family (Gipson's wife has filed for divorce, has custody of the kids & wants to move to Oregon, but Gipson has purchased a house in NY for her to stay along with his sons, so that he can be near them), and he becomes further enraged, determined to make life difficult for Banek.\n\nMeanwhile Gavin gets suspicious that his partners sent him alone to represent his firm for the custody hearing of a 107 MM $ foundation. He suspects foul play on behalf of his partners & wonders that he hast even seen the rest of the files of the foundation. He tells his partners about how he lost the power of appointment for the Dunn foundation. The partners ask him to reformat the power of appointment & use the signature page from the living will of Simon Dunn to forge a new power of appointment file. Gavin activates the sprinkler system to empty the office & takes the time to study the original Dunn foundation files & discovers that the partners are paying themselves 1.5 MM $ per year out of the foundation money just to manage it.\n\nGipson calls Banek & asks him to turn on his credit before his meeting with the banker in 1/2 hour or he will destroy the Power of appointment. Banek agrees & asks his man to turn the credit back on. The credit is turned back on, but a bankruptcy filing on Gipson is missed & shows up in his records during GIpson's meeting with the banker. On this basis his loan application is refused. Though it is made clear that Banek and Gipson are radically different, they both have an angry, vengeful streak, each capable of abandoning his morals just to punish the other. The film ends with both men having a new outlook on life, concentrating on ethics and the moral implications of their actions.\n\nBanek approaches Gipson's bank & tries to co-sign the loan application so that Gipson can see his kids everyday by keeping them in NY. Banek also writes a letter to the court admitting that the power of appointment is a fake & was obtained by him & his partners when Mr Simon Dunn was of reduced mental facilities.\n\nUltimately the two men apologize to each other, and Gipson returns the file, but it looks to be too late for both of what they were trying to do. Banek ends up using the file to force his boss to do the right thing & return the 3 MM $ he stole from Dunn's foundation till date and plans to represent Gipson pro Bono so he can get the house he wants.\n\nBanek also visits Gipson's wife to explain everything to her, knowing he owes Gipson that much. The movie ends with Gipson's wife and children smiling at him from across the street, indicating a possible reconciliation or at the very least some kind of arrangement between the two in the future."

    "Chaos": "Seattle PD Detective Quentin Conners (Jason Statham) apparently kills a car hijacker called John Curtis and the young woman the hijacker is using as a shield. Newspapers and reporters blame Detective Conners and his partner York. After a fellow police officer, Callo, testifies against them, Conners is suspended, and York is fired. York tried to kill John, but York accidentally killed the hostage. John tried to kill York, but Conners killed John in self-defense.\n\nIn the present day, Lorenz (Wesley Snipes) and four other criminals take hostages in a bank. Lorenz has only one demand, to negotiate with Conners. Conners is reinstated but put under the surveillance of a new partner, the young Inspector Dekker. Conners is given control of the negotiations, and after a bank teller is shot, he orders a SWAT unit to cut the building's power and go in. During an explosion, the criminals flee during the ensuing panic and chaos.\n\nDekker and Conners learn more about each other at a local diner, slowly building a friendship, but Dekker disapproves of Conners' cowboy methods. Dekker explains that during negotiations, Lorenz was making many cryptic references to chaos theory. As they leave to examine new evidence, Conners pays with a ten dollar bill and says he does not like to tip. Dekker swaps the ten for a twenty of his own.\n\nA TV camera caught a shot of one of the criminals, who is arrested together with his girlfriend at her home, where banknotes are found with a scent used to mark evidence collected by the police. The banknote serial numbers did not come from that day's robbery, but had been placed in police storage and signed out a two weeks earlier by Inspector Callo. He is found shot dead in his home, together with incriminating evidence linking him to the heist.\n\nWhen reviewing video footage from the bank, Dekker notices one corner of the bank is deliberately shielded from view. In that corner, they find the bank regional manager's computer. Fingerprints on the keyboard reveal the identity of a hacker that Conners himself had arrested, but whose conviction was overturned after the shooting on the bridge. Conners and Dekker want to question the hacker, but he is shot dead by Lorenz, and a gun fight ensues. Lorenz escapes.\n\nDekker questions the hospitalized bank robber identified in the news TV footage and finally breaks him when he casually explains the impact of a massive overdose of morphine while slowly injecting something into the suspect's drip. An amazed Conners watches and later calls him a hypocrite. Dekker responds by explaining he only injected more saline solution.\n\nThe suspect reveals Lorenz is Scott Curtis, the brother of John shot earlier, and Conners leads a stakeout at an address where all the gang are to meet that night. It is Scott's house. Forced to go before Scott arrives, a shootout results in both suspects' deaths, and a bomb blows up the building while Conners is inside.\n\nDekker is devastated but realizes that Callo's signature requesting material from the evidence storage was forged by the evidence custody officer, who reveals that Scott is actually York. In a flashback, York stands on the bridge and fires the first shot, killing the woman hostage in the opening sequence. Tracking Lorenz/York's mobile phone, Dekker surprises York at a diner, and York takes a woman hostage in a reversal of the standoff on the bridge. Dekker chases and eventually kills York.\n\nWhen Dekker pays for his coffee at the diner, he discovers the banknote Conners used to pay for lunch with is also scented, which means Conners was also involved in taking the money from police evidence. Dekker finds a copy of James Gleick's book on chaos theory in Conners' house, showing he had faked an earlier ignorance of the mathematics. On a hunch, Dekker looks for airplane tickets booked in the name of James Gleick and runs to the airport.\n\nDuring a mobile call between the now disguised Conners and the searching Dekker at the busy airport, flashbacks reveal how the seemingly unconnected events in the film form a pattern, just as predicted in chaos theory. Conners reveals that he placed his badge on Scott's corpse before the explosion. Conners and York recruited a group of ex-convicts from their past. Callo was framed for being a dirty cop. Conners ends the call, walks casually to a private jet, and takes off while sipping champagne."

    "Chappie": "Set in an undeterminate year of the near future in South Africa, Johannesburg is the first city to use a robot police force. Tetravaal is the company that develops and supplies the robots to the city. The deployed robots are called Scouts. Created by Deon Wilson (Dev Patel) these robots are completely automated and have artificial intelligence. Deon's office rival Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) has created The Moose (basically ED-209 from Robocop), which is operated remotely by a human. Moore isn't a big fan of Deon's work.\n\nScout unit 22 is back in the shop again. It seems this particular unit is accident prone and is always getting serviced. The techs get it back into action and send it out into the field where it assists in a police raid on a drug deal gone bad.\n\nOn one side of the drug deal are Ninja and Yolandi, members of the real world South African band Die Antwoord. They're playing characters named Ninja and Yolandi (same as their own real names). They're teamed with Amerika (Jose Pablo Cantillo). They're trying to deliver goods to crime boss Hippo (Brandon Auret). Hippo demands that Ninja, Yolandi and Amerika pay him $20 million within 7 days. During the meeting, the police and Scouts raid. Ninja, Yolandi and Amerika manage to escape during the police raid. Hippo shoots a rocket launcher into Scout 22's chest, seriously damaging it. Hippo also manages to evade the cops. After the raid, Yolandi has an idea that the scouts are probably like a television, so they must be able to be turned off by a remote control. If they can find out how to do that they won't have to worry about these effective weapons.\n\nMoore asks Tetravaal's boss Michelle Bradley (Sigourney Weaver) for more money to assist with further developing his Moose. Deon's robocops are such a hit that the government has decided to sink more money into that project, and ordered 100 more of them, and has no interest in the Moose.\n\nBack at the shop at Tetravaal's headquarters, the technicians see that Scout 22's battery is fused with his chest piece, so he's beyond repair. They set him aside to be scrapped.\n\nHippo calls the gang and tells them that he's not dead or in jail, and he still expects them to pay him the $20 million they owe him. Ninja, Yolandi, and Amerika believe they need to conduct another heist to get the money for Hippo.\n\nDeon goes home, which has several artificial intelligence robot pets, and starts working on his newest project, which is creating an artificial consciousness for the Scout units. After a long night of programming and Red Bull, he succeeds.\n\nNinja's gang sees a TV news story and learns Deon is the mastermind engineer behind the Scouts, so he must be the guy who knows how to power them off.\n\nDeon asks Bradley if he can use his artificial consciousness program on the scrapped 22 unit. He explains that it's possible that this could create a robot smarter than humans and it could even conceivably write music and poetry. She explains that they're in the business of defense and not in the business of creating poets, so she denies his request citing insurance, red tape, and paperwork.\n\nDeon decides to take a chance, gets the scrapped 22 and the Guard Key, which is needed to update the programming in all the robots as a precaution against hackers, and smuggles them out of the factory. Ninja's gang kidnaps him before he can get home.\n\nMoore, in a meeting with Ms. Bradley and a committee, tries to convince them that the moose is a better weapon than the Scouts, but they turn him down saying that the moose is big, expensive and ugly.\n\nThe gang (Ninja, Yolandi, and Amerika) takes the kidnapped Deon back to their base/hideout and ask him how to shut down the Scouts. He says it's impossible. They're about to kill him, but discover the Scout 22 unit in the back of his van. They put a gun to his head and force him to agree to program it to work for them. He assembles it for them, explaining that if his program works, it can be taught. He installs the new software into the unit and Scout 22 \"awakens\" and has the personality of a scared child. Yolandi takes on an immediate mother-role and tells him that he's a happy chappie and names him Chappie. They let Deon leave, but he asks to come back to check on the progress. He also tells them that because of the fused battery, Chappie has only about five days to live.\n\nMoore wants to work on his Moose, but discovers that the Guard Key is missing. His computer tells him that the guard key is installed in Scout 22 and he knows that Deon must have taken it.\n\nThe next day Yolandi and Amerika start teaching Chappie how to talk. Ninja gets mad that because he needs Chappie trained to help them to do one more heist so they can pay back Hippo. Ninja starts to train Chappie to shoot guns but gets very frustrated because Chappie is a slow learner.\n\nAt work, Moore puts his gun to Deon's head and tells him to return the guard key. Deon refuses and Moore pulls the trigger but it merely clicks and Moose pretends it as a joke.\n\nBack at the hideout, the gang teaches Chappie some more words, including tough gangster talk and profanity.\n\nDeon leaves work to check on Chappie. He's mad that the gang is turning him into a foul mouthed thug, so he asks Chappie to promise not to count drugs, commit crimes, or do anything illegal. Moore follows Deon to the hideout in hopes of finding out where Deon is keeping the guard key. Ninja returns and threatens to kill Deon again for interfering with his plans. Yolandi say to let Chappie be a kid but Ninja says that he needs Chappie to be ready within 5 days to pull the heist to repay Hippo (or else Chappie will \"die\"). Moore leaves without interacting with any of these tough characters.\n\nNinja and Amerika take Chappie to the middle of a rough area and leave him there as a test to see if he can toughen up and defend himself. The locals start attacking him with rocks, pipes, and flammable chemicals, but because Chappie promised Deon he wouldn't do anything bad, he doesn't fight back. He manages to run away and escape.\n\nIn a van, Moore tracks the escaping Chappie and locates him. Moore deactivates Chappie with a battering-ram-looking electronic device. They take him into the van and cut off his arm and remove the guard key. They were going to chop him up into more pieces but Chappie fights back and manages to open the doors and escape out the back of the moving van. Moore says they can let him go now because he is crippled because he's missing the guard key and can't learn anymore.\n\nChappie makes his way back to the gang hideout. Yolandi is angry that Amerika and Ninja endangered Chappie. Amerika and Yolandi fix him back up by attaching a new, spare robot arm. Yolandi reads Chappie bedtime stories and tells him that he has a soul inside and \"that's what Mommy loves.\" Ninja and Amerika figure out a way to trick Chappie into helping them. Together, they steal cars so they can get money to get weapons so they can do their big heist.\n\nOnce they have enough money, they go to a crazy looking tall, round apartment building, not completely unlike the building in Dredd. When they get there, a dog fight is taking place. The criminals there see the Scout (Chappie) and scurry away, thinking he is a police scout on a raid. Chappie and Ninja go up to see the arms dealer Pitbull (Johnny Selema) and buy explosives, weapons, and Sony Playstation 4's. When they return, Chappie is trying to nurse a dead dog back to health. Ninja explains to him that in life you can either end up as the dead dog, or as the winning dog. He must fight if he's to be like the dog that survives. He also tells him that his battery can't be fixed because Deon made him to die. But if he helps them with their heist, they'll be able to buy him a new body. Chappie goes along with the idea because he doesn't want to die.\n\nDeon returns to the gang hideout and is disappointed that Chappie is out doing illegal stuff with Ninja and Amerika. Yolandi tells him that he should leave because Ninja will kill him if he finds him there. Chappie, Ninja and Amerika return. While the two are alone, Deon tries to reason with Chappie, but Chappie tells him that he's angry that Deon didn't tell him that he was going to die in a few days. Chappie tells Deon that he wants to live and stay with \"Mommy\" (Yolandi) and not die.\n\nBack at Tetravaal headquarters, Moore, plugs the guard key in and installs new firmware, genesis.dat, that remotely disables all scouts around the country. They fall to the ground wherever they are. The criminals realize this and pummel any Scouts they see. Thousands of crimes all over Johannesburg are now being committed since the Scouts have been shut down. Total chaos and viciousness rule the city.\n\nDeon loads the deactivated Chappie back into the van and returns to Tetravaal headquarters. Deon finds the Guard Key in Moore's computer and reverses the genesis firmware update that Moore remotely installed into all Scouts, and brings Chappie back to life. However Chappie knows he is still going to die in a few days and says he wants to be transferred into a new robot body that is hanging there. Before they escape, Chappie sees The Moose robot. Deon explains that The Moose is controlled by transferring a human operators consciousness into The Moose via a control helmet. Chappie steals the helmet and they go back to the gang hideout.\n\nThe gang has Chappie help them rob an armored car, and it is covered live on the news. Hippo and his gang are watching. In the escape from the armored car heist, Chappie asks about his new body, now that they have money, and Ninja lets on that it was all lies, that he needed Chappie just for the heist, and that there would be no new body for Chappie, who would still die in a few days. Chappie is furious. At the gang hideout, Deon says that a threat is coming (meaning Hippo) and Chappie must be prepared to fight. He shows Chappie a gun but Chappie refuses to use it. Chappie rigs up Yolandi's laptop and all the PS4s to create a super computer. He tests the helmet out on Yolandi and it works!\n\nMoore tries to convince Ms. Bradley that since all the Scouts have broken down that they are defective and that she should enable him to proceed with the Moose program instead of the unreliable Scouts. Moore also convinces Bradley that Deon is the cause of the Scout robots committing crimes. Bradley gives Moore authorization to use The Moose to combat the crime and track down Deon.\n\nHippo's gang shows up at Ninja's gang's hideout. He now wants Chappie for himself after seeing it on TV during the armored car heist. Back at Tetravaal headquarters, Moore remotely pilots a flying Moose to Ninja's hideout to obliterate them all. A three way fire fight breaks out. The Moose steps on Amerika and rips him in half and flings him against a building. Moose starts indiscriminately shooting at everyone. Moose fires cluster bombs at Hippo's gang and kills them all except Hippo himself. Chappie attacks Moose. He is no match for Moose's awesome firepower but is able to jump on the Moose and attach a bomb. Hippo shoots Ninja and Deon but then Hippo is killed by Ninja with a shovel. Ninja taunts Moose so that Deon, Yolandi and Chappie can escape in the van back into their hideout building. The Moose is about to take out Ninja, but Yolandi surprises it by launching a rocket at it. The rocket is ineffective and Moose turns and shoots Yolandi dead. Chappie jumps back into the action and blows up The Moose with the explosive he had attached to the Moose when he had jumped onto it earlier before the Moose (Moore) has a chance to kill Ninja. They bury Yolandi in a shallow grave. Chappie says he's needs to go back to Tetravaal to kill a man (meaning Moore, whose Moose robot shot Yolandi/Mommy dead).\n\nChappie drives Deon in the van back to the Tetravaal headquarters/lab. Moore is still there. Chappie beats him into a mangled mess, but doesn't kill him. Deon is seconds away from death, but Chappie puts Deon's consciousness into the one orange test robot that's available. As Transvaal secutiry forces try to get into the room they're in, Deon, now a robot, figures out a way to save Chappie too. He sends Chappies consciousness into the nearest fallen Robocop, out on a street nearby the Tetravaal HQ, from Moore's computer, which still has the guard key inserted into it.\n\nSo Deon and Chappie are both robots now. Chappie saved Yolandi's consciousness saved on a USB flash drive from earlier when he was testing out the helmet. Chappie hacks into the Tetravaal robot factory and has it create a new schematic, for a female scout. Presumably much later, after Tetravaal has built and tested the new female Scout, Yolandi's consciousness is transferred into a brand new Fembot.\n\nAnd Deon, Chappie, and Yolandi all lived happily ever after....... as Scout robots."

    "Charlie Chan at the Olympics": "After a pilot testing a device by which his plane is guided by remote control is hijacked, Charlie Chan of the Honolulu police comes on the case. Chan finds the plane with the device, which could be sold for millions to a foreign power, gone and the pilot dead. Later, he also locates the body of the murderer, Miller. Chan, Hopkins, the airplane owner, and Cartwright, the inventor of the device, take the dirigible Hindenburg to Berlin, which is currently hosting the 1936 Summer Olympic Games, to investigate three people traveling there by ocean liner: Dick Masters, an Olympic pole-vaulter and aviator, who did not pilot the plane the day of its disappearance because of an injured shoulder; Yvonne Roland, who visited Miller's room; and Arthur Hughes, an arms dealer, who wanted to buy the device.\n\nIn Berlin, Chan finds the device hidden in a box in the luggage of Masters' girl friend Betty Adams. He substitutes a book and returns the box to Hopkins. Cartwright tells Chan that Hughes accused Hopkins of double-crossing him and threatened to expose Hopkins' plan to sell the device to a foreign government, and that Hopkins escaped with the box. Masters is now suspected because the box was found in Betty's room and the fact that he was on the boat with Roland. Roland, however, takes the box to a foreign diplomat, the Honorable Charles Zaraka, who discovers the book instead of the device.\n\nAfter Hughes learns of this, Chan's son Lee, an Olympic swimmer, is kidnapped. Following instructions sent from the kidnapper, Chan brings the device, which he has had removed and replaced with a transmitter, to an agreed upon location. He is then taken to Zaraka's estate, where Hopkins identifies the device. Hughes arrives with his thugs and fights Zaraka's henchmen for the device before he discovers that it is a phony. After the police arrive and Hopkins is shot, Chan reveals that Cartwright shot him, and that earlier Cartwright murdered Miller and made it appear that Hopkins stole the device. Hopkins recovers and Lee wins the hundred meter race."

    "Charlie Countryman": "From Wikipedia:\n\nCharlie Countryman, a man living in Chicago, is distraught after the death of his mother Kate. At the hospital, he sees her as a spirit and asks her what he should do with his life. She replies by telling him to go to Bucharest because she believes it seems right to do. On the flight, he meets Victor, an elderly man sitting next to him, who is returning home to Bucharest after seeing a Cubbies game, with a silly hat as a gift for his daughter. Partway through the plane ride, Victor dies, and Charlie sees him too as a spirit, who asks him to deliver his gift to his daughter, which he promises to do.\n\nArriving at the airport, he is hassled over the hat by the authorities, but eventually meets Victor's daughter, Gabi, whom he falls instantly in love with. After he gives her Victor's gift, they part. While in a taxi, he finds Gabi in her car on the side of the road. She tells him she can't keep up with the ambulance containing her father's body, and he offers to help catch up to them. While engrossed in playful banter they collide with the speeding ambulance truck, crashing and flipping over, with Victor's body flying out of it. Gabi and Victor's body is taken to the hospital by another ambulance, leaving her car with Charlie. Gabi's car does not start immediately and Charlie is unable to follow the ambulance. After neighborhood kids help jump start the car Charlie decides to take the car to Bucharest opera house where Gabi performs as a cellist. In the car Charlie finds a revolver in Gabi's purse, inscribed 'For my darling Gabi, Love forever Nigel'. Gabi soon calls her cell phone and instructs Charlie to look for a man name Bela. Bela puts Charlie in an empty opera box. Charlie falls asleep and wakes up to a opera performance. He also sees Gabi emotionally playing her cello in orchestra pit. Following the performance, Gabi is confronted by her estranged and unstable husband, Nigel. Gabi suddenly spots Charlie walking by, and Nigel notices and questions him aggressively. Gabi lies that Charlie is a gay tuba player, after which Nigel leaves.\n\nCharlie arrives at a hostel and meets his roommates, Karl and Luc. After partying for a while, Charlie enters the bathroom and encounters Nigel, who was waiting inside to apologize for his earlier behavior and mildly threatens Charlie. After departing, Charlie then sees Gabi leaving the hostel after dropping off his belongings left in her car. They spend the night out, sharing fond memories of each others parents. Later, they part ways with Gabi telling him that if he finds her the next day, she will kiss him. Exhilarated, Charlie begins running down the street when he is suddenly hit by a cab. The cab driver takes him to the hospital. Hours later, back at the hostel, Charlie wakes up to find out that Karl has taken too much Viagra, and they go to a club seeking to ease Karl's discomfort. This results in Karl having a sexual climax in front of the strippers, who then call the bouncers to have them taken to the manager's office. The trio are shocked to find their bill is deliberately overcharged due to Karl's incident, as explained by the manager, Darko. Darko notices that Charlie is staring nervously at a picture of Nigel and Gabi on the wall. Darko aggressively questions Charlie about Nigel. Charlie bargains with Darko, in exchange for providing information on Nigel they wouldn't have to pay the bill. Darko gives Charlie his phone number and they leave. Realizing that it's morning Charlie goes to the Bucharest opera house in the hopes of seeing Gabi.\n\nLater on that evening Bela notices Charlie sleeping on the opera house steps and wakes him up. After being begged, Bela reluctantly takes Charlie to Gabi's house, were a memorial party is being held for Victor. Gabi takes Charlie to the attic to kiss him. Charlie tells Gabi about his encounter with Darko. Later on, Nigel unexpectedly shows up. He spots Charlie and while holding a broken glass to his neck, aggressively confronts him on not being a gay tuba player and being attracted to Gabi all along. Gabi forces Nigel to leave by firing a warning shot at him. After the party, Gabi tells Charlie how she met Nigel. Although Gabi loved Nigel it was a mistake marrying him. Gabi realized too late that Nigel was an active criminal. At some point Victor found an incriminating tape to use against Nigel to force him to leave the country. It worked until Victor's death; now Nigel wants the tape. Charlie then confesses that he is in love with Gabi, they make love.\n\nThe next morning, Charlie finds Gabi gone and a note telling him to not leave the house. Charlie explores the house and discovers a room filled with tapes, specifically one that's labeled \"Cubbies\". The tape turns out to be the blackmail footage Victor found. It shows Nigel and Darko killing a group of people at a restaurant. A disturbed Charlie leaves the house and finds Gabi and Nigel at a nearby restaurant. He approaches them and explains that he \"saw the tape.\" Nigel violently interrogates Charlie until the police arrive and take Charlie away. At the station Bela bribes the police to not press charges but instead take Charlie to Budapest. Upon arrival at the hostel to get his belongings, he is alerted by the presence of Nigel's associates. They chase Charlie to a subway, where he escapes and runs back to Gabi's home to find the tape missing. He finds Darko and his men waiting for him, showing Karl and Luc's backs glued together outside. Gabi calls Darko regarding the tape, prompting Darko to leave the house.\n\nCharlie waits for Gabi at the Opera House, where she tells him that she doesn't want to see him again and says goodbye. She goes to her car with Nigel, who has the tape and intends to destroy it so that life with Gabi can continue. A saddened Charlie once again speaks to the ghost of his mother, who says that she is proud of him and hopes he doesn't die. After she disappears, he runs to Gabi's car and attempts to stop Nigel, only to be knocked unconscious. He wakes, hanging from a rope by his ankle above a boat dock. Nigel burns the tape and prepares to shoot Charlie, but decides to let Gabi do it. She ends up sparing Charlie just as the cops arrive. Charlie is dropped into the lake and survives, and Nigel commits suicide by cop. The film ends with Karl and Luc finally being separated from the super glue, and Charlie and Gabi finally together."

    "Charlie's Angels": "Natalie Cook (Cameron Diaz), Dylan Sanders (Drew Barrymore), and Alex Munday (Lucy Liu) are the \"Angels,\" three talented, tough, attractive women who work as private investigators for an unseen millionaire named Charlie (voiced by Forsythe). Charlie uses a speaker in his offices to communicate with the Angels, and his assistant Bosley (Bill Murray) works with them directly when needed.\n\nThe Angels are assigned to find Eric Knox (Sam Rockwell), a software genius who created a revolutionary voice-recognition system and heads his own company, Knox Enterprises. Knox is believed to have been kidnapped by Roger Corwin (Tim Curry), who runs a communications-satellite company called Redstar. The Angels infiltrate a party held by Corwin and spot a thin man (Crispin Glover) who was seen on the surveillance videos during Knox's kidnapping. They chase and fight the thin man, but he runs away. When they follow him, they discover Knox.\n\nAfter the Angels reunite Knox with his business partner Vivian Wood (Kelly Lynch), Charlie explains that they must determine whether the thin man has stolen Knox's voice-recognition software. The Angels infiltrate Redstar headquarters, fool the security system, and plant a device in the central computer that will enable them to explore it remotely. They retire for the night after giving Bosley the laptop computer that communicates with the Redstar computer. Dylan takes up Knox's offer to spend the night with him, but he betrays her later that night, explaining that he faked the kidnapping with help from Vivian and the thin man. He has kidnapped Bosley, and, with access to Redstar's central computer, he intends to use his voice software with the Redstar satellite network to find and kill Charlie, who he believes killed his father in the Vietnam War.\n\nKnox shoots at Dylan, apparently killing her, but she escapes unharmed. Natalie and Alex are also attacked, and Corwin is murdered by the thin man. When the Angels regroup, Charlie's offices are blown up, but a radio receiver survives in the rubble, and the Angels deduce Bosley's location as he speaks to them using a radio transmitter implanted in his teeth.\n\nWith help from Dylan's current boyfriend Chad (Tom Green), the Angels approach the abandoned lighthouse where Knox is holding Bosley prisoner. The Angels rescue Bosley and defeat Vivian, the thin man, and some henchmen before Knox blows up the lighthouse, but Knox uses his software and the Redstar satellite network to locate Charlie when he telephones Bosley.\n\nWhen Knox escapes in a helicopter armed with a missile, Bosley helps the Angels board the helicopter, and Alex reprograms the missile, which blows up the helicopter and kills Knox while the Angels land safely in the ocean. Seeing the opportunity to finally meet Charlie in person, the Angels enter the beach house that Knox targeted, but Charlie has already left. He remotely congratulates them on a job well done and treats them and Bosley to a vacation. When Charlie speaks to the Angels by telephone on the beach, unseen by most of the group, Dylan suspects that she sees him nearby talking into a cell phone."

    "Charlie's Angels": "A team of Angels, led by senior operative John Bosley (Patrick Stewart) (Charlie's first and original assistant), capture international embezzler Jonny Smith (Chris Pang) in Rio De Janeiro and turn him over to American authorities. A year later, the European division of the Townsend Agency is informed that Elena Houghlin (Naomi Scott) (a scientist and creator of the Calisto project who later gets recruited to become an Angel), an engineer and programmer employed by entrepreneur Alexander Brock (Sam Claflin), wants to expose her superiors, namely Brock's head of development, Peter Fleming (Nat Faxon), for covering up a discovery about how an energy conservation device that she helped invent named Calisto has the potential to trigger fatal seizures when used. She meets with operative Edgar \"Bosley\" (Djimon Hounsou) to turn over her findings, but an assassin named Hodak (Jonathan Tucker) ambushes the meeting and subsequently kills Edgar and leaves Elena to drown.\n\nEdgar's protege, Jane Kano (Ella Balinska) (a former MI-6 agent who became an Angel), rescues her and brings her to operative Rebekah \"Bosley\" (Elizabeth Banks) (a former Angel who became one of Charlie's assistants) with the help of her partner, Sabina Wilson (Kristen Stewart) (a wild and rebellious Angel). Elena tells Rebekah that Calisto can be hacked and turned into an EMP on the human body, triggering seizures and deaths on a mass scale. Meanwhile, John, who has since retired from the agency, discovers that Rebekah has tagged him with the agency's specialized sub-dermal implant without his knowledge.\n\nRebekah tasks Jane and Sabina, joined by Elena, with breaking into Brock's corporate headquarters to steal the remaining Calisto prototypes before they can be duplicated. Elena finds one of the devices but is forced to use it to escape, killing a security guard in the process, while the other prototypes are already gone, and Fleming is identified as the thief. Rebekah tracks him to Istanbul, where Jane utilizes one of her old intelligence contacts, Fatimah (Marie-Lou Sellem), to locate Fleming. They track him to a remote rock quarry, where the supposedly imprisoned Smith is revealed to be Fleming's intermediary for selling Calisto. Hodak is also present and kills Fleming before the Angels break up the sale. Rebekah suddenly disappears, allowing Smith and Hodak to escape with the prototypes.\n\nReturning to their safe-house, Sabina shares her growing belief that Rebekah is secretly working against the agency and has been manipulating them to steal Calisto for her own benefit. While the three ponder Sabina's suspicion, safe-house is bombed. Rebekah shows up only to be shot by John, who has come to rescue Elena. Jane and Sabina manage to survive and seek medical help from Fatimah.\n\nRebekah reappears and explains that John is the real traitor and that he has spent the last few decades secretly building his own network within the agency after he was passed over to succeed the late Charlie Townsend.\n\nJohn takes Elena to a party hosted by Brock, who reveals himself as the mastermind behind the attempt to assassinate Elena and, unbeknownst to him, John's plan to turn Calisto into a weapon. Using Elena's colleague Langston (Noah Centineo) as a hostage, John forces her to program a Calisto device to kill both Langston and her before leaving. The Angels, having deduced his plan due to the information provided by Smith, who is later revealed to have defected to their side, show up and rescue Elena and Langston, Elena having already disabled the Calisto device.\n\nJane exacts revenge by impaling Hodak on a spike, while Rebekah catches up with John and his men. Outnumbered, she has other Angels posing as guests subdue the men, after which Sabina knocks out John with a punch. Brock is arrested for conspiracy, and Jane and Langston start a relationship. Elena is recruited as an Angel by the Townsend Agency after passing a series of rigorous training exercises and receives an official Angels tattoo."

    "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle": "After rescuing U.S. Marshal Ray Carter (Robert Patrick) in Mongolia, the Angels (Natalie Cook (Cameron Diaz), Dylan Sanders (Drew Barrymore), and Alex Munday (Lucy Liu)) and Jimmy Bosley (Bernie Mac) (John Bosley's adoptive brother) are sent to recover 2 titanium rings stolen from the United States Department of Justice that can display the people listed in the witness protection program (HALO - Hidden Alias List Operation). Carter's ribs were supposedly broken during the rescue. DOJ official William Rose Bailey (Bruce Willis) and a protected witness, Alan Caulfield (Eric Bogosian) are among those killed. Bailey and Carter had the 2 rings, which are now stolen. Each ring alone is useless, but together the rings reveal the list of all protected witnesses.\n\nAt Caulfield's house in San Bernardino, the Angels track his assassin Randy Emmers (Rodrigo Santoro) to a beach (The Angels had determined that the killer has a scar on his knees and he surfs) where they also meet former Angel Madison Lee (Demi Moore). Meeting Lee, Alex wonders who among the Angels would be the first to leave. Alex believes that Natalie will soon marry her boyfriend Pete, and they would have to break in a new Angel.\n\nThe girls track Emmers to the Coal Bowl. During the Coal Bowl motorcycle race, Emmers targets another witness named Max Petroni (Shia LaBeouf), and the Angels try to intervene. Emmers is killed by the Thin Man (Crispin Glover) (believed to be dead after the events of the first film). Inside Emmers' pocket, the Angels discover the photos of Caulfield, Max, and, surprisingly, Dylan, under her birth name, Helen Zaas.\n\nDylan reveals that she is a protected witness after sending her former boyfriend, Irish mob leader Seamus O'Grady (Justin Theroux) to prison. O'Grady has since targeted those who wronged him; including Dylan and Max, whose parents O'Grady killed. As Max previously testified against O'Grady, he is sent to the home of Bosley's mother for protection. Thin Man is their only lead left.\n\nAt a monastery, the Angels learn about the Thin Man's past from the Mother Superior, who reveals his name, Anthony. The girls deduce that the Thin Man was protecting Max since they went to the same Orphanage. The girls track down Thin Man to San Pedro harbor. Afterwards, the Angels track O'Grady's mob at San Pedro and manage to get the rings, but O'Grady threatens Dylan with the murder of everyone she loves. Natalie attends her boyfriend, Pete Kominsky's (Luke Wilson) high school reunion at Hermosa Beach, where she overhears his friends implying he might propose, which she feels is too fast since they just moved in together.\n\nAlex returns home to her actor boyfriend, Jason (Matt LeBlanc) while Dylan leaves the Angels and heads to Mexico. Jason had run into Alex's father and told him about Alex's true profession. But the way Jason explained it, it seemed like Alex is a porn movie star or a prostitute. When Natalie, Bosley, and Alex notice the letter she left for them, they realize that Dylan fled to protect them. Natalie asks Charlie (John Forsythe) how O'Grady got out of jail, and Charlie reveals someone had him released on good behavior. While hiding out in Mexico, Dylan is convinced to return after seeing an apparition of former Angel Kelly Garrett.\n\nNatalie and Alex deduce that Carter is the one who let O'Grady out of prison after seeing him return Bosley's keys without any pain, despite claiming to have broken his ribs beforehand. Following him, the two witness him getting killed by Madison, the true mastermind. Madison says that with the rings she could go into business for herself, instead of taking orders from a box.\n\nThough Dylan arrives to back the group, the Angels are shot by Madison, who takes the rings, though they survived via Kevlar vests worn under their clothes. Back at the base, Charlie reprimands Madison for what she's done and confronts her for endangering her former teammates' lives. Madison is angry she never got the recognition she deserved from Charlie and shoots his speaker. The Angels realize that Madison is going to sell the rings to the O'Grady Crime Family, the Antonioni Mafia, the Tanaka Yakuza, and the Diablo Cartel at the Hollywood Walk of Fame, where Jason's film premiere is about to commence.\n\nThe Angels arrange for the buyers to be arrested by the FBI while they confront Madison and O'Grady. The O'Grady's enter the melee, having avoided arrest when Seamus realized the Angels' plan. The Thin Man comes to the Angels' aid, helping Alex and rescuing Dylan when she is being attacked by O'Grady - he begins to fight O'Grady and kicks him off the roof. The Thin Man grabs Dylan and chokes her at first, but they ended up sharing a kiss and he pulls some of Dylan's hair out. Just as he is about to say something, O'Grady stabs him, and he falls off the roof.\n\nO'Grady nearly succeeds in killing Dylan as well, but she blinds him, causing him to lose his footing and fall to his death (in the unrated cut, O'Grady is still alive and attempts to get back up but is stopped by The Thin Man, who also survived; Dylan accidentally knocks over the \"E\" sign and it falls on O'Grady, possibly The Thin Man as well). The Angels fight Madison all the way to an abandoned theatre, where they kick her into a chamber filled with gas and she fires her gun, inadvertently blowing herself up.\n\nThe Angels attend the premiere, where they learn that Mama Bosley is adopting Max. Peter surprises Natalie by asking her to get a puppy (the big question he was planning on asking her) and Alex terminates her \"time out\" with Jason. The Angels celebrate their victory together with Bosley."

    "Cheech & Chong's Next Movie": "As the movie opens, Cheech & Chong are siphoning gas from a tow truck to fill the tank of their \"borrowed\" car. As they drive away, Chong rolls and lights up a joint, igniting the gas fumes and causing an explosion in the car. Cheech is dropped off at a movie studio to ask a girlfriend for clean clothes, claiming his state was caused by rescuing a baby from a fire. Meanwhile, Chong returns the car to their prudish neighbor, resulting in a confrontation as the neighbor rants. Chong returns his sentiments by shooting exhaust fumes out of the house window, killing the neighbor's rose bushes. After smoking up, Chong plugs in his guitar and starts wailing away loudly, annoying the entire neighborhood. Cheech arrives, barely managing to pull the power on the amplifier. Cheech drives Chong to pick up a urine sample for his probation officer (last time, he used an unwashed mayonnaise jar; this time, his sister's urine, and she's pregnant!). While driving down the street, Cheech swerves the van causing the urine to splash all over Chong. Chong pulls out a large bag of what appears to be cocaine, refusing to share until Cheech asks to just \"smell\" it. Chong shoves the bag in Cheech's face, revealing it to be a bag of his laundry soap. Cheech grabs and drinks from the urine sample, spits it out, and Chong hands the urine to him again! The next morning, Cheech awakens to find the van has been stolen. The phone rings, Chong answers and hands it to Cheech, only to find that Cheech has been fired and that his employer has retrieved the van. The day continues as the guys go to the welfare office causing a ruckus as Cheech attempts to fornicate with one of the office workers on her office floor. Later, Cheech invites the worker over the house, practically pushing Chong out the front door. Upon finding that Cheech's cousin (Red) is in town, Cheech sends Chong to meet with Red. Chong finds Red arguing in a hotel lobby with Pee Wee Herman over an unpaid bill only to discover that Red is trying to get back his large duffel bag, stuffed full with marijuana buds. The two break into another room through a window, make their way to Red's room, and successfully grab Red's luggage. Meanwhile, Pee Wee has called the police and while leaving, Red records the police sirens and bullhorn comments on his boombox. The two end up at a brothel and, as they're leaving, Red plays the police sounds on his boombox, emptying the brothel completely, including a tied-up girl. She takes them to the home of her \"trick\" and before long, all of them, save Cheech, end up in a comedy club. Meanwhile, Cheech has fallen asleep waiting for Donna, the office worker, dreaming vividly of her. Back at the comedy club, Pee Wee Herman shows up and a riot ensues. As Red & Chong leave, Chong complains that they left the herb behind. Red takes Chong to one of his marijuana fields to get more with the police in hot pursuit. The police set off the booby-traps as Red and Chong are abducted by aliens. Back at the house, Donna shows up while Cheech is dreaming that the neighbor has interrupted his fun. He shouts out in his sleep \"Get out! Get the f*** out, you f*** a**hole!\" Donna, thinking he's yelling through the door at her, leaves angrily. Cheech falls back asleep, continuing to dream. Chong appears in the dream as a warlord and, upon awakening, realizes that Chong is now home, wearing a horned helmet, and holding a vial of \"space coke.\" Cheech samples the coke and goes into a rage, tearing a hole in the side of the house and doing the same to the neighbor's house. The movie ends with Cheech & Chong flying high into the air to the great doobie in the sky."

    "Chennai Express": "Rahul Mithaiwala (Shahrukh Khan) is a forty-year old bachelor who lives in Mumbai. His parents died in a car accident when he was eight years old and was brought up by grandparents. His grandfather has a sweet-selling chain store - Y.Y. Mithaiwala. Before his birth centenary celebration, two of Rahul's friends suggest a vacation in Goa which he accepts. On the eve of the celebration, his grandfather dies whilst watching a cricket match. His grandmother tells him that his grandfather desired to have his ashes divided into two parts - to be immersed in the Ganges River and Rameswaram respectively. She requests Rahul to go to Rameswaram and immerse them. Rahul reluctantly accepts her request but was also eager to attend the Goa trip.\n\nHe and his friends thus make plans to dump the ashes at Goa. But they were forced to change the plan when Rahul's grandmother wanted to personally see him off. This forces him to travel by train; he booked a single ticket on the Chennai Express. He plans to meet his friends at the Kalyan Junction station from where they would travel to Goa by car. Rahul forgets to take his grandfather's ashes on reaching the station and when he comes back to get it, the train started to roll on its wheels. While trying to step out of the train, he notices a girl (apparently South Indian) running to catch the train. He helps her board the moving train. He then sees four people running behind to catch the train, helps them all to get in and himself misses the platform to get off.\n\nHe tries to flirt with the girl assuming she does not know his language. To his surprise, she starts communicating by singing parodies of Hindi film music, so that the others don't understand. Rahul, on her demand, lends his mobile phone so that she can contact her friends; but the men with her throw it away from the moving train. He gets annoyed by this, however keeps quiet seeing that they carry weapons and guns along. He informs the ticket examiner about them but they push the man into a lake below the railway bridge.\n\nExtremely panicked, Rahul learns that those men were actually kidnapping her and that her real name was Meenalochni Azhagusundaram (Deepika Padukone) a.k.a. Meenamma. She was trying to flee from a forced marriage to Tangaballi (Nikitin Dheer). Her father Durgeshwara Azhagusundaram (Sathyaraj), is a powerful headman of the Komban Kaum (an anagram of Kumbakonam) in Tamil Nadu. He wants her to marry Tangaballi so that he would assume control of the neighboring village as well.\n\nMeena takes Rahul to her father and introduces him as her lover. Tangaballi challenges Rahul for a duel which he accepts in sign language. On the night of the fight, Rahul escapes with the help of a local Sikh policeman but in the turn of events, ends up in Komban Kaum again. Surrounded by sickle-wielding henchmen of Azhagusundaram, Rahul then pretends to take Meena as hostage and escapes again in her father's favorite car. When the jeep breaks down, they quarrel and go separate ways. But Rahul not knowing which way to go, comes back to Meena who takes him to the Vidhamba village where a wedding was taking place. Meena lies to the people that they are a married couple who have eloped and needed protection and rest.\n\nThe villagers grow fond of the couple and take care of them as long as they stay while Meena realizes that she has fallen in love with Rahul. When Rahul has plans of leaving secretly, Meena does not want to earn the distrust of the affectionate villagers. As he tries to leave, he is caught by Tangaballi but the villagers help them escape again. Meena who persuades him to immerse his grandpa's ashes travels with Rahul to Rameswaram. There they complete the rites and, on their way, back, Rahul, realizing that he has also fallen for Meena, does not tell her where they're going. He and Meena arrive back at the village to face the wrath of her father and Thangaballi. Rahul tries to talk some sense into Azhagu to make him understand and honor his daughter's wish. He also professes his love for Meena.\n\nRahul confronts Thangaballi and confidently challenges him to fight, for real this time. In the ensuing climactic knock down, drag out fist fight, Rahul is gravely wounded and bleeding profusely. Despite his injuries, Rahul survives and manages to overpower Thangaballi, but refrains from killing him. Thangaballi accepts his defeat graciously and bows out, humbly praising Rahul for his fortitude. Azhagu Sundaram also turns over a new leaf, accepting that the big, strong heart of a common man is a much greater, powerful force than their physical ability and political clout. Meena's father finally allows Rahul to marry his daughter. As Rahul and Meena embrace, the film ends with a voiceover from Rahul narrating that love knows no barriers of region or language barriers and that with a strong heart, there is no limit to what a common man can achieve."

    "Chernobyl: Abyss": "Chernobyl: The Abyss is the first major Russian feature film about the aftermath of the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power station, when hundreds of people sacrificed their lives to clean up the site of the catastrophe, and to successfully prevent an even bigger disaster that could have turned a large part of the European continent into an uninhabitable exclusion zone. The unlikely hero of the film is Alexey (Danila Kozlovsky), a fireman at the power station. Olga Savostina (Oksana Akinshina), a hairdresser is attracted to Alexey. They used to date 10 yrs ago, but have since drifted apart and met at a chance encounter at a hair dressing saloon in Chernobyl. Olga goes on a date with Alexey, but at the end of it Olga wont invite him home. So, Alexey barges in only to realize that Olga has a son named Alexey. Turns out Alexey is Alexey's son, but Olga wants to hide this fact from her son as she considers Alexey immature. Alexey is leaving for Kiev and wants Olga and her son to go with him, but she refuses.\n\nApril 26, 1986, 4th reactor of Chernobyl nuclear plant explodes. Alexey is first on the scene (he was on leave, but saw the explosion on hopped on the first fire truck he could find). Tigran (Samvel Tadevosian), firefighter has severe radiation burns after he was ordered to look into the open reactor to see whats going on. Tigran explains to Alexey that the reactor exploded, before he collapses and is taken away in an ambulance. Alexey goes to the roof to find his missing friend Yura Kondratyuk (Dmitry Matveyev), fireman. Alexey is exposed to nuclear fuel and other materials on the roof. Alexey brings Yura down, but is suffering from radiation burns himself. There is no room in the ambulance, so he starts driving it, in order to get away from the power plant. Alexey is admitted to the hospital and spends the night there\n\nThe next morning he is sought out by Dina (Ravshana Kurkova), a radiologist, who has been sent from Kiev to work with Alexey. Alexey's exposure was 14 rems and he was lucky. Dina asks Alexey to come with her as he knows all the pass-ways underneath the reactor. At a Govt committee, Alexey learns that there are pools of water under the reactors. If the fuel melts the concrete and drops into the water, it will instantly vaporize into steam and that means another release of radioactive particles all over Europe. A team needs to go under the reactor and open the sluice gates to drain the water. The Govt offers treatment in Swizterland and apartments in Moscow to those who take the assignments. The military wants to send 2 divers into boiling water, to turn the valves and open the gates (where 8 mins of exposure will kill the divers from radiation), but the civilians on the committee want to see if the electric motor that opens the gates is not flooded and can be used instead. Alexey refuses to help as he says he was on leave since yesterday and his entire team is dead anyways.. Alexey finds Olga and Alexey. Young Alexey has radiation sickness (he saw the explosion at his fishing trip with his friends and was exposed). The town is being evacuated and they are ordered to leave for Kiev. On the bus Young Alexey starts vomiting and Alexey realizes his duty to safeguard other mothers and daughters and sons and decides to go back to Chernobyl.\n\nHe meets the committee who is preparing for the dive. He meets the chairman Tropin (Igor Chernevich), and asks hi if young Alexey can be treated in Switzerland if Alexey decides to join the dive. Tropin agrees.\n\nAlexey is accompanied by Valery (Filipp Avdeev), an engineer, Nikita (Maksim Blinov), Ivan (Aleksandr Alyabyev) and Boris (Nikolay Kozak), a military diver, on a perilous mission to drain water from a reservoir under the burning reactor. They have no time for proper planning; water in the flooded corridors they will have to traverse is getting hotter by the hour as the molten reactor core seeps ever closer. Nikita is hit by radioactive steam inside the passageways and dies. Valery refuses to go further, but is hit by Boris, who wants to complete the mission at all costs.\n\nPrepared to sacrifice their own lives in order to prevent an even greater catastrophe, the three men descend into the depths of the reactor building. The wire spool drops into radioactive water and Boris bravely goes in to retrieve it. The wire spool is required to provide electricity to the motor to open the sluice gates. The trio is able to connect the wires, but for reason the motor wont start. The trio have already been exposed heavily to radioactivity. Boris says that the valve needs to be opened manually. Boris is distraught that Nikita has died and runs into the passageway directly underneath the reactor. Further ahead he sees the nuclear fuel that has melted the concrete of the reactor and dripped into the passageway below and is slowly edging towards the water pools. Boris is fatally exposed (700 rems), but manages to close the steel bulkheads, sealing the magma.\n\nValery and Alexey rescue Boris and get out of the tunnels and are rescued by the medical teams waiting at the entrance. Based on Alexey's report, army teams enter the reactor passageways to open the sluice gates. Boris dies. At the hospital, Valery is told that he will have to dive into the hot water to open the valve. Valery was an engineer at the plant and the only one with enough knowledge to find the valves accurately. Young Alexey is sent to Switzerland as promised for his treatment. Olga is not allowed to go with him and stays behind with Alexey. Alexey goes back into the reactor with Valery. Valery and Alexey enter the scalding 140 degrees water and get to the valves. The valves are stuck with rust and the duo battle with it, eventually wringing it lose and opening the sluice gates. Valery dies during the attempt and Alexey cant save him. Alexey survived as the water receded and he was rescued. Alexey is radioactive and kept in isolation. Young Alexey returns to Soviet Russia after 3 months."

    "Chick Fight": "Anna Wyncomb works in a coffee shop and her dad, Ed, has dated Chuck since her mom, Mary, died nine months ago. One night, Anna and her best friend Charleen, a police officer, accidentally set the coffee shop on fire after enjoying a joint. Now blaming herself for the incident and totally broke, Charleen takes Anna to the underground all-female fight club and introduces her to Bear, the manager and the referee of the fight club. There, Charleen explains to Anna that the winning fighter puts a dollar bill on the wall with their name on it and the fight club serves as a safe haven for women, who want to cope with the problems of their lives. Charleen persuades Anna that she must agree to fight in order to resolve her problems. Anna reluctantly agrees and fights in her first bout but is easily knocked out. Anna realizes that her mom founded the fight club and has fought several bouts, a secret that her mom kept from Anna her whole life, dying from cancer six months after her final fight.\n\nAnna is then introduced to former boxing coach Jack Murphy, who now works in a restaurant at the beach side and agrees to train her. She later meets Olivia, an undefeated fighter, who antagonizes her and Anna challenges her to a fight, which she accepts. As the days and her training progresses, she wins several fights. Anna is attracted to Roy, the attending doctor for the fight club who also works in the local hospital - despite the fact that he has a relationship with Olivia. However, they end their relationship after a drunken night. However, Anna did not take it seriously and ignores his advances. Anna later witnesses Olivia fighting three girls in the ring and savagely knocking out all of them. Realizing how savage Olivia is, Anna quits, saying that fighting is not the best solution to solving her problems.\n\nThe next day, Jack convinces Anna to continue to fight and tells her to \"leave behind fear and doubt and take that final step to bravery\". Anna then receives a call from Chuck saying that her dad is in the hospital after suffering a heart attack. Arriving there with Charleen already at the room, Ed tells Anna that he knows her mom founded the fight club and has passed its ownership to Anna. Charleen convinces Anna to sell the fight club and start a new life. When Roy appears, Ed persuades Anna to reconnect with him. She apologizes to him and Roy reveals to her that he never had sex with Olivia and has been only thinking of Anna.\n\nOn the night of her fight, with renewed courage, Anna confronts Olivia for the first time in the ring. Anna is overwhelmed by Olivia in early rounds, but as per Jack's advice, Anna uses her headbutt to knock her out, eventually winning the fight and thus marking Olivia's first loss. As the police arrives at the door to raid the fight club, Olivia pays respect to Anna before escaping with the fellow fighters and, despite Charleen's objection, Anna chooses to stay behind, stating that she now takes the ownership of her mom's fight club, and is arrested.\n\nCharleen bails Anna out of jail but Anna is put on trial for her misdemeanor. Aided by her lawyer Chuck and the presiding judge Naomi Andrews, Mary's old friend, Anna is acquitted of all charges. Three months later, Anna has renovated the fight club and she agrees to fight with Charleen as a friendly fight. But the two get knocked out at the same time and call Roy for medical attention. Later, Anna goes to the restaurant to pay Jack for her training fee, but is shocked to find that she has to pay much more.\n\n(copied from Wikipedia)"

    "Children of Men": "In 2027, worldwide female infertility has led to the collapse of society. The United Kingdom, the last known stable nation, is deluged by asylum seekers. In response it has become a militarized police state as British forces round up and detain immigrants. Kidnapped by an immigrants rights group known as \"The Fishes\", former activist turned cynical bureaucrat Theo Faron (Clive Owen) is brought to its leader, his estranged wife Julian Taylor (Julianne Moore). They parted ways after their son died from a flu pandemic in 2008.\n\nJulian offers Theo money to acquire transit papers for a young black female refugee named Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey), which Theo obtains from his cousin Nigel (Danny Huston), a government minister. However, the bearer must be accompanied, so Theo agrees to escort Kee in exchange for a larger sum. Luke (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a Fishes member, drives them and former midwife Miriam (Pam Ferris) towards the coast to a boat. They are ambushed by an armed gang and Julian is fatally shot. Luke kills two police officers who stop their car and they escape to a safe house.\n\nKee reveals to Theo that she is pregnant and that Julian told her to only trust him. Julian had intended to hand Kee to the \"Human Project\", a supposed scientific group in the Azores dedicated to curing infertility. However, Luke persuades Kee to stay. That night, Theo eavesdrops on a meeting of Luke and other members and discovers that Julian's death was orchestrated so the group could use the baby as a political tool to support the coming revolution. Theo wakes Kee and Miriam and they steal a car, escaping to the secluded hideaway of Theo's aging hippie friend Jasper Palmer (Michael Caine), a former editorial cartoonist.\n\nA plan is formulated to board the Human Project ship Tomorrow which will arrive offshore from the Bexhill refugee camp and Jasper proposes getting camp guard Syd (Peter Mullan) to smuggle them in, as he's had dealings with him in the past. The Fishes trail the group and Jasper stays behind to stall them, giving the government-issued suicide drug Quietus to his catatonic wife. A horrified Theo witnesses the Fishes kill him before escaping with Miriam and Kee. Later they meet Syd, who transports them to Bexhill as prisoners. When Kee begins having contractions on a bus, Miriam distracts a suspicious guard with mania and is taken away.\n\nAt the camp Theo and Kee meet Marichka (Oana Pellea), who provides a room where Kee gives birth to a girl. The next day Syd informs Theo and Kee that a war between the army and the refugees, including the Fishes, has begun. After seeing the baby Syd threatens to turn them in but they attack him and escape. Amidst the fighting between refugees and British troops, the Fishes capture Kee. Theo tracks her and her baby to an apartment which is under heavy fire from the military and escorts her out. Awed by the presence of a baby, all the combatants stop fighting momentarily, enabling them to escape. Marichka leads them to a boat in a sewer, but refuses to join them. As Theo rows away, he reveals to Kee that he had been shot during the gunfire. As they witness the aerial bombing of Bexhill by the Royal Air Force, Kee tells Theo she will name her baby Dylan after Theo's son. Theo loses consciousness and Kee begins to sing a lullaby as the Tomorrow approaches through the fog."

    "Chill Factor": "Ten years after a covert military experiment on a remote Pacific island went wrong and killed 18 American servicemen and his assistant, Dr. Richard Long (David Paymer) is still trying to forget the havoc and death that his experiment caused. Living in the small town of Jerome, Montana, Long still conducts scientific experiments at the local US Army base, but far more enjoys his time fly-fishing with Tim Mason (Skeet Ulrich), who works in the local greasy spoon and has a checkered past.\n\nLong's life changes, and then ends, when he's visited by Colonel Andrew Brynner (Peter Firth), a former military officer who took the blame and served ten years in Leavenworth for Long's experiment. Now a free man with a score to settle with the government, Brynner has assembled a team of high-tech former US Army soldiers-turned-terrorists, including an icy woman named Vaughn (Hudson Leick), and plans to steal and then sell \"Elvis\"-Long's highly volatile, blue crystal substance-to the highest international bidder, thus having his revenge against the government for covering up its existence, and unfairly making him a scapegoat for their handling of the weapon.\n\nUnfortunately for Brynner, Long has already delivered \"Elvis\" to Tim, along with the directions that the substance must remain below 50 F degrees, or it will detonate, and kill everyone within several hundred miles of it.\n\nAfter Mason and Arlo (Cuba Gooding Jr.), a wisecracking ice cream delivery man, have a run-in with Brynner, they set off en route for Fort Magruder, some 90 miles away. The two don't get along with each other-Arlo only agrees to transport the substance in his ice cream truck because Mason held a gun on him-but they find a common bond in trying to avoid Brynner and his team. With the help of Colonel Leo Vitelli (Daniel Hugh Kelly), Arlo and Mason try to survive Brynner's attacks, avoid the local deputy, Pappas (Jim Grimshaw), who's also hot on their trail, and keep \"Elvis\" below 50 degrees.\n\nArlo and Mason finally reach the base, but get ambushed by Brynner and his team who plan on detonating the device in an abandoned weapons test facility. Brynner does not want to leave witnesses, and decides to kill both of them. However, the military arrives and rescues Arlo and Mason before the device explodes, killing Brynner and his men. Colonel Vitelli arrives and congratulates them on a job well done, but Arlo and Mason threaten to expose the U.S. government for using unstable nuclear weapons for the past decade. Vitelli decides to pay them both to keep them silent, but also threatens to have them quietly killed if they say a word about what had happened and about the weapon's existence. All three of them leave the area in a helicopter."

    "Circle of Iron": "This movie, chiefly written by Bruce Lee, is about obtaining Enlightenment, so this synopsis also contains some Buddhist interpretation of \"Circle of Iron.\" Many things happen in a very subtle manner, so I explain their significance, even though the movie does not.\n\nThis movie is about finding the Buddha, within your own mind (and heart, and soul). And so, after Enlightenment, you become the manifestation of Buddha. Then, you can truly say, I AM the Buddha. (Of course, some lucky Christians also achieve Enlightenment. Then they can say, I AM the Christ, although a manifestation of Jesus as a human being, not as being God Himself.)\n\nTeachings (and Rules) are important for the Way toward spirituality, but they cease to teach you when you are Enlightened (or, on that last path to receive Enlightenment). At this point, every person decides what they will do to live their own spiritual life, and what they believe about the Supreme Being.\n\nCord sets off to find \"The Book.\" It is guarded by Zetan: \"the Keeper of The Book.\" The Book contains the secrets of the Universe (and it really does), and gives you the information needed to become Enlightened.\n\nAlong the way, there is a flute playing a haunting song (and his Spiritual Guide who plays that flute). Whenever Cord hears the music play, he is about to face a step on his journey (or, one of his 3 Trials).\n\nCord tried to become the Seeker to Zetan by entering the Contest, offered at a local monastery. Many martial arts masters are there to vie in ritual combat to be awarded the Medallion. This is the prize. This Medallion proclaims its wearer as that monastery's Seeker (to face and defeat Zetan, so he is allowed to read The Book). Everyone sent in the past has failed to defeat Zetan.\n\nThe movie opens toward the end of the Contest. We watch Cord quickly win 2 rounds of the Contest. The final round arrives; it is Cord versus Morthon. During their combat, Cord hit Morthon while he was down on the ground. So, Cord is disqualified, and Morthon wins the Contest. The medallion necklace is put around Morthon's neck.\n\nCord objects to be required to obey every Rule . But the official proclaims that rules are Rules, and perfectly following them is an important trait of anyone in order to defeat Zetan. The next morning, Morthon sets off to find Zetan. Cord follows him for a day, but then runs off when he hears the inviting flute music, until he gets to where the sound is coming from. He witnesses a fight. A man with a flute fights, and quickly defeats, many angry men who attack him.\n\nMorthon left, so Cord leaves alone, on his journey. Along the way, Cord has 3 Trials. For the first 2 Trials he is forewarned about the situation.\n\n. . . . . . . The Monkey Trial: Don't turn your back on the attacker, even if he is just a Joker.\n\nCord hears the music again. So he follows the music again, and meets the man playing it. Later this man will become Cord's Spiritual Guide. This Guide has a scene with a Monkey. The Monkey screams loudly, and keeps trying to get behind him. He constantly turns to face the Monkey. After the Monkey leaves, Cord asks if this is the secret of how to handle Monkeys. ... Yes, it is.\n\nCord walks on alone and finds Morthon, bleeding and unable to walk. Cord asks: \"Did Zetan do this to you?\" ... Morthon moans: No, \"I failed the First Trial.\" ... Cord asks, \"What was that First Trial?\" ... ... \"Monkeys.\" As he dies, Morthon tells Cord to take the Medallion. Cord puts it on. Now, Cord is the \"legal\" Seeker for the monastery.\n\nCord enters the nearby cave, full of monkeys. There he witnesses another Seeker with a Medallion (from a different monastery), fighting with the Chief Monkey. It rages on for minutes. (During this fight Cord hears his Spiritual Guide repeat the lesson: \"Unmask his ego\" and you will win against a Monkey.) The fight finishes. The Seeker is killed, and his medallion is yanked off from his neck (and added to a pile of medallions, from all of the other dead Seekers).\n\nCord walks up. The Monkey says many things to belittle Cord, and make jokes of Cord's every answer, and keeps circling around him. Cord stays focused, and doesn't allow himself to forget why he is there -- to defeat the Monkey (and win his First Trial). Finally, Cord says: \"I don't want to fight you\"; so \"let me just walk around you.\" The Chief Monkey replies: \"That is not in the order of things\" (you must fight me, in order to go to Zetan). The fight is ON. Cord hits and hits, the Monkey gets blocked at every blow. The Monkey stops. Then he tells Cord how to find Zetan: \"Go to a wilderness, and find a rose there.\" ... Cord has survived his First Trial.\n\nCord gets his next clue of the upcoming Trial. Cord meets a man standing in a barrel of oil. This man has been inside of the barrel for 10 years. He is trying to melt off his penis. His legs are like spaghetti, and his penis is just a wisp. He is doing this because he can't prevent himself from having affairs (after making 100 Vows of Celibacy over the years, and lacking the courage to cut his penis off). His wife (after earlier not liking the idea) supports him living in the barrel, and even brings him food to eat. When Cord tells him he's looking for Zetan, the man warns him that sex will get in the way, and that Cord will falter in his search because of his sex drive. Then he invites Cord to get in the barrel with him (because -- he thinks -- Cord will fail, just like the man did, and then Cord will want to melt his off ). Cord laughs, and walks off. Cord has taken a Vow of Chastity a year before, and he \"knows\" that he will remain faithful to his Vow until he attains Enlightenment. The man in the oil was weak about sex, but Cord is NOT weak.\n\n. . . . . . . .The Sex Trial (in 2 parts). . . . Part one. Cord arrives at an encampment, in celebration, with dancing and fireworks. He sees a veiled woman go by, with a rose on her robe (Find a rose in the wilderness). This is the Way to Zetan! He follows the woman into a tent. Changshaw invites Cord to sit next to him. He offers Cord whatever he needs for his journey. Cord says he wants to \"Find a rose in the wilderness.\" She is Changshaw's 9th wife, \"You may have her.\" Cord tells him about his Vow of Chastity. Changshaw laughs. \"My wife would break her promise of fidelity to me, and you would break your promise to yourself.\"\n\nA man with another Medallion wants to fight Changshaw; Changshaw tries to talk the man out of it. The man insists. OK. The fight is on. Changshaw kicks him in the groin over and over. He dies with a crushing blow. (His medallion is yanked off and thrown into a box of medallions.) Changshaw announces that by dying, the man has finally found what he was looking for, knowledge and truth. Cord watches. That night, Cord decides to sleep with wife number 9. He has realized that sex is a beautiful thing. He falls in love, and asks her to come live with him. She agrees, but tells him to get some sleep for their journey. The next morning, Cord finds out that she is dead, and Changshaw has killed her (and left the area). Cord is filled with anger at Changshaw. Eventually, Cord discovers why the other man wanted to fight Changshaw -- in revenge for killing his lover, Changshaw's 8th wife.\n\nCord meets with his Spiritual Guide: Cord tells him his understanding of the lesson: \"Don't hold on too tight\" to anyone else. Cord is told: \"You can't even possess yourself, how can you possibly hope to possess someone else?\"... Good lesson. Our minds wonder from second to second, so we cannot possess our own mind completely ... therefore, how can we control the mind of another person? ... Well, we can't. ... This lesson (later) gravitates inside of Cord to become: 'Don't hold too tightly to your feelings of revenge on Changshaw.' ... Don't let your journey for Enlightenment come to an end, just because of this betrayal by Changshaw.\n\n. . . . . . . Time for the Third Trial. It is a dark night. Cord goes to sleep. A scary noise awakens him. A growling panther arrives. Cord is afraid. Then Cord realizes what is happening: the panther is Death (incarnate). Cord was at first afraid, but then finds his center and says: \"Come any time, welcome guest.\" ... Cord has passed the Third Trial. He faced Death itself, and didn't want to hold on to his Life. By offering his Life, he has saved his Life. Now, onward, to find Zetan.\n\nCord asks his Spiritual guide to be his Teacher. He will only be teacher if Cord asks him no questions about anything Cord sees him doing. \"Agreed.\" Then, Cord sees 3 separate incidents where he couldn't understand his Teacher's actions, 2 apparently angry and destructive to someone, and 1 other which seemed irrational. Cord fires his Teacher, and asks him \"Why?\" . . . and finds out how blind he was; the Teacher explained each situation to him, and Cord saw that his actions each time were absolutely what should have occurred. The former Teacher leaves. Now Cord is on his own for the rest of the way.\n\nThe Sex Trial. Part 2, Cord arrives. Changshaw greets him, and then he kills a bull with a karate chop (maybe, to let Cord know this Trial could kill him, like the man before). Changshaw brags about killing his 9th wife with his own 2 hands, because Cord had slept with her. But Cord replies, \"I killed her, with THESE 2 hands\" (by his very act of sex, and asking her to leave her husband). Changshaw lets him know he has passed this Trial: (You are) \"Not the same Cord\" (I knew before).\n\nNow a final battle, to learn the secret of all the Trials. Cord blocks all of the blows. Then Changshaw suddenly becomes the Monkey he had fought before, Cord loses his center and gets hit. Then Death appears, growling, Cord gets hit. He hears the music, smiles a knowing smile (all 3 of the creatures in my Trials are the same man), Cord relaxes and finds his focus. He lands all of his blows, and gets none back. Changshaw pulls back from him. ... It's over. . . . Changshaw smiles, Cord smiles, and laughs. ... Cord hears the magic words: \"You are the Chosen\" (the one to meet Zetan). Zetan is on that island. A boat arrives and transports Cord across the water. Cord is ceremonially cleansed, and given a new robe to wear (the same one that everyone else is wearing there). Cord is now ready to face Zetan.\n\nComment: Cord has faced the Monkey trial, in which he has resisted becoming shamed (and from losing his focus on the task at hand). Cord faced Changshaw, with love, instead of with hate and vengeance (after Cord's beloved girlfriend was killed because of his affair with her). Then, Cord invited Death to come and kill him whenever he wants to. Cord has conquered his fear of Death, his fear of obsession with sex (and revenge), and his fear of being shamed. These are 3 Trials which face all men, all of our lives. How we react to these Trials controls our actions (and our feelings, and our view of Life). While passing through Cord's 3 Trials he has transcended those blocks to living freely, and so, he is one of the lucky people who can now read from The Book, and find personal Enlightenment.\n\nCord is led to a group of people. Cord asks to see Zetan. The group opens up, and there stands an old man, with a large image of 3 Roses on his robe (like the Monkey said: \"Find a rose there\" ... the 3 Trials). Then Zetan offers Cord a rose he picks off of a bush. Cord refuses. All he wants to do is to read The Book. Zetan walks him across the monastery. There are many people in the courtyard. They haven't read The Book, \"They are called the Near Ones. They are studying the perfecting of perfection\" (instead of finishing their journey, and reading The Book, after passing their own 3 Trials). Zetan has Cord sit, and drink tea. Cord asks, \"When do we fight?\" Zetan says, \"About what?\" ... \"The Book.\"\n\nZetan mocks all of those Seekers who come to read The Book. He invites Cord to just live there, in the monastery's perfect harmony. But Cord will not be deterred from his mission to become Enlightened. Cord again asks to see The Book. Zetan escorts him away, saying, they are on their way to perform the ceremony of \"Your becoming the Keeper of The Book.\" ... What??? ... but Cord walks on.\n\nZetan asks Cord to sit on the Seat of Knowledge (which fills Cord with the peaceful atmosphere of the monastery). Then, Zetan tries to convince Cord to take over Zetan's job, of being the Keeper of The Book. Cord refuses, and asks for The Book. It is brought to him, and is lovingly held by one of the Near Ones. Cord opens The Book. Page one appears, Cord is surprised and confused. ... Page 2 is confusing. Page 3, a knowing smile appears. Page 4, the power of Enlightenment hits. Cord closes The Book.\n\nAll 4 \"pages\" are mirrors. All that Cord could see in each page was his own face. Cord now knows the secret to Enlightenment: It is all within Cord himself -- look within yourself, deeply into your soul (where all your pure thoughts and desires live), and that continuing to hold onto that deep look will bring forth Enlightened thoughts, one after another.\n\nCord asks what happens to people who have read The Book. Zetan says that some of them become teachers, and provide the 3 Trials that Seekers must overcome. Cord says, \"And one of them plays a flute that only I can hear\" (his Guide). Cord laughs with his realization. Zetan again asks Cord to become the Keeper of The Book. Cord laughs. Zetan begs him to become the Keeper. Cord laughs more.\n\nComment: All these many years, Zetan himself has been afraid to look into The Book. Good grief, for all these years, Zetan has failed to complete his journey. Zetan stopped just inches from success ... and instead, Zetan has to witness Seeker after Seeker who WILL look into The Book. Then, add to this, that he can't find anyone to take over his job commitment as the Keeper of The Book. But, Zetan is just another person who has turned away from his Goal, and who has lived to regret it. What they say (in almost any religion) is, don't start on a deep spiritual path half-heartedly, because stopping that journey before you finish it, may later leave you worse off than if you hadn't started it at all.\n\nCord follows the music to his Spiritual Guide, who looks at him and says: \"You've looked at The Book, Cord.\" ... \"Yes.\" ... \"And what did you see?\" ... \"Everything.\" ... Wow! Cord is in the club of Enlightened beings. They excitedly hug each other. Then, he hands his flute over to Cord, and Cord begins to play music (a different song), while his Guide dances. The journey ends. The new journey begins. The credits roll.\n\nAfterthoughts. Cord did not play by the Rules (of the Contest at the monastery). This very act of not blindly following Rules is the need of a Seeker, in order to find personal Enlightenment. These rule-followers are the many Seekers who die along the Way, or just get distracted from their Goal. So, it is important to follow the Rules most of your life. But, when the time comes to seek Enlightenment, rules just get in the way of progress toward your Goal. Enlightenment requires a different view of Life and events. Keep focused on the Goal, but be open to making all of the changes (in attitude and perspective) that you need to continue to go along your journey in order to achieve that Goal."

    "Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant": "Darren Shan is a regular teenage kid. He and his brooding friend Steve hear about and attend a rare freak show coming to town - the \"Cirque du Freak\" - where they see many strange acts, including a wolf-man, a snake-boy and a bearded lady.\n\nSteve and Darren think it all a joke until a vampire, Larten Crepsley (whom vampire-aficionado Steve recognizes) comes on with a very poisonous performing spider. Slipping away from a police raid after the show, the boys split up. Darren, due to his infatuation with spiders (as strong as Steve's infatuation with vampires), sneaks backstage to examine Larten's caged spider more closely. While hiding in a closet, he overhears Steve begging Mr. Crepsley to be made a vampire and become his apprentice. Mr. Crepsley tests Steve but finds he has \"bad blood\" and will not transform him. Steve becomes angry and threatening before being thrown out.\n\nEscaping the theater with Larten's spider, Darren quickly accepts a ride home from a retund stranger - Mr. Tiny - who seems to have designs on Darren and vampires (and, very conveniently, just happens to have Darren's bicycle in the trunk of his limo).\n\nNext day, Darren takes the spider to school with him. Steve finds out and accidentally drops the cage in the middle of the halls. The spider gets out, panics the students, bites Steve and escapes. Steve is rushed to the hospital where doctors say that there is nothing they can do.\n\nDarren sees Mr. Crepsley about the possibility of an antidote. The vampire agrees to give him the only cure if Darren agrees to become his half-vampire assistant. Darren complies, and Steve gets the cure.\n\nSteve recovers but starts to realize that Darren is now part vampire, becoming angry and jealous and feeling betrayed. Darren concurrently develops a taste for raw meat and his little sister's blood and comes to know that he can't stay home anymore.\n\nLarten stages Darren's death and Darren is buried (with Steve - infuriated at being left out and left behind - noticing signs at the funeral that all is not as it seems). Mr. Crepsley comes to dig up Darren and deliver him to the circus freak encampment of Mr. Tall.\n\nAs Darren begins a life of chores amid his new family at the freak camp, Steve, seething, becomes ripe pickings for Mr. Tiny, who appreciates the kid's violent nature.\n\nFollowing a visit from the ominous Mr. Tiny, Larten begins Darren on lessons in vampire fighting, but Darren's avoidance of drinking blood keeps him physically weak and incapable of full fighting power. Meanwhile, Steve gets initiated among the vampaneze (aggressive, violent, victim-killing vampires). His first assignment: a late-night visit to his least-favorite school teacher.\n\nFour vampaneze visit the freak camp. Unable to take Darren, they take monkey girl Rebecca, of whom Darren has grown fond. Meanwhile, Steve and Mr. Tiny pay a visit to Darren's parents and abduct them as well.\n\nAgainst his wishes, Larten heads back to the theater where Darren confronts vampaneze Murlaugh and Steve, fighting for the survival of Rebecca and Darren's family while Mr. Tiny enjoys watching the groundwork form for a war between vampires and vampaneze."

The owner directly shoots them. The gang takes inside one of their own, who's wounded. Albert (James Earl Jones) accepts taking him inside. He says that a plague killed almost all the adults, and the children had to support themselves and survive in a wild world. Two teenagers meet and swim naked in the reservoir of drinking water. She (Joannelle Nadine Romero) stays at a farm while Lee (John Stockwell) goes a round riding his bike with a lizard-skull mask. He has the dream of all bike gangs joining together, instead of having the Clippers and the DA. He is not interested in farm life anymore. He goes to the city where he's attacked by a crowd of workers. At the beginning, the DA are threatening towards Lee (Marcia Holley, Kane Hodder and Alan Marcus). Lee leaves and saves Yogi (Rae Dawn Chong) from a biker attack, who at the beginning didn't even want to tell him her name. They have to hide behind wall from other crazy bikers. At a warehouse, Frankie (Pamela Ludwig) tells Mick (Darrell Larson) that they have found cat food which humans can eat.\n\nCarver (Robby Benson) wants to control the city as a first step to control the whole world. His plan is to wreck everything using a gang against another, as in this chaotic world there are no police forces. Wickings (Kim Cattrall) is mentioned by Chris (Sean Ryan), as she will attend the fight. There's going to be a fight for Lee. They go to the library / local museum to have a duel. Wickins says to Mick that she works for the government, who works to bring law, medicine and food to the city. The duel starts with nets and chains as weapons. From behind an Indian poster appears another biker fighting against lee, who won't kill the loser Mick - and Yogi is happy about that decision, because her gang wants to end the violence.\n\nLater, Wickings admits that she's only an observer. Carver gets a truckload of weapons. Whitey (John Diehl), another biker is spying on the operation but falls from a woodbeam. Ray (Danny De la Paz), Carver's ally, shoots Whitey, and Wickins sees it, but can't do anything about it.

    "City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold": "The movie opens with Mitch Robbins (Billy Crystal), back in Colorado, riding a white stallion to visit deceased trail boss Curly's grave. Mitch thanks Curly for the time they spent together and says that he truly changed his life. Just then, Curly (Jack Palance) rises from his grave and drags down Mitch who screams until he awakens in his New Rochelle home, realizing it was just a nightmare. He soon forgets the bad dream when the phone rings and it is Mitch's yearly call from his mother who retells the story of his birth and wishes him a happy 40th birthday. Unlike his 39th birthday, Mitch's outlook on life has changed drastically in the last year as he welcomes his 40th one with open arms. His wife, Barbara (Patricia Wettig), informs Mitch that after his birthday dinner, she made arrangements for them to have the whole house for themselves and advises her husband to save up all the energy he can because he will need it.\n\nEver since he returned from his cattle drive adventures the previous year, Mitch has made quite a few changes to his life which now makes him much happier. He moved his family out of the city, kept Norman the calf who is now all grown up and has made a lot of progress at work which lead him to get promoted to station manager.\n\nGoing into work, he meets his best friend Phil Berquist (Daniel Stern), who Mitch has recently employed at the station. Unlike Mitch, Phil's life has not gotten better over the last year. He got washed up in his ugly divorce with his ex-wife Arlene and now suffers from loneliness to the point where he considers trying to get back with Arlene, which Mitch equates to a criminal willingly checking himself back into Alcatraz prison. To help him out of his funk, Mitch invites Phil over for his birthday dinner with his family.\n\nOn the train ride back home, Mitch swears he sees Curly on the train but it turns out to be a stranger that just looks like him. The nightmare and the vision lead Mitch to wonder aloud if Curly was truly dead when they buried him but Phil believes that Mitch is just seeing things, since they checked Curly and confirmed he was dead before burying him.\n\nWhen they arrive home, Mitch is shocked to find his younger brother Glen (Jon Lovitz) has arrived unexpectedly. Mitch has a strained relationship with his brother because he is mostly immature, irresponsible, keeps borrowing money from everyone without ever returning it, moves from one relative to another without an invitation until he gets thrown out, and has an irritating fixation on the Godfather trilogy. Seeing how Barbara is already irritated by Glen's presence and wanting to be alone with his wife, Mitch arranges for Glen to leave with Phil after dinner.\n\nFinally alone with Barbara, Mitch, looking to role play for his wife puts on Curly's hat and feels something poking him. He then finds a piece of paper, with a missing corner, hidden inside the hat that looks like a treasure map supposed to lead to one million dollars worth of gold bullion and dated from 1908. Interrupted by his wife, Mitch hides the map but then sees Curly staring at him from outside his window and screams.\n\nThe next day, back at work, Mitch tells Phil that he saw Curly again but when he went outside he had disappeared. Phil questions Mitch as to why Curly would travel all the way to New Rochelle and Mitch reveals the map he found in Curly's hat. Interrupted by Glen, Phil takes the map and heads to the library to do some research. Meanwhile, Glen inquires as to why Phil has a job at the station but not him since he asked Mitch for a job a few months ago. Mitch reveals he doesn't trust Glen since he pulled some strings in the past to get him a job and Glen never bothered to show up. Glen is deeply hurt and leaves but Mitch convinces him to come with him and Phil to a Las Vegas business convention they are attending over the upcoming weekend where Glen might make business connections of his own.\n\nMitch then joins Phil at the library where they analyze the map and surmise that it belonged to Lincoln Washburn who robbed a Western Pacific train carrying gold back in 1908. Quick calculations tell them that one million dollars worth of gold back in 1908 would now be worth about 20 million dollars (in 1994). They also find that the trail starts not far away from Las Vegas where they happen to be going in just a few days. Mitch is reluctant to pursue the treasure or even believe it exists until they find a picture of Lincoln Washburn and realize he was obviously Curly's father. Having already invited Glen for the weekend, Mitch decides to let him in on the treasure and offers him to join them. He also lies to his wife about missing out the convention and potentially jeopardizing his career.\n\nThe three of them rent horses and supplies from store owners to whom Mitch tries to lie about their motives but quickly finds out Phil has already told them everything. Following the awkward encounter, the three of them head out to find the treasure.\n\nAfter being lost for a moment, they find the very first indicator that the map is real when they find a rock formation that looks like a hand pointing the way just like the map says. However, their excitement is short lived when Glen accidentally sets fire to the map and Mitch almost falls off a cliff to retrieve it. Fortunately, Glen only burned a small hole and they are able to continue their journey. Mitch decides to draw a copy of the map in case of another accident and give it to Phil which causes an argument because Glen whines about his brother not trusting him again. Mitch then gives the copy to Glen.\n\nThe next day, Phil stops for a bathroom break. As he's squatting, he feels a painful sting on his butt. When he turns around, he finds a rattlesnake and believes he was just bitten. Thinking he is about to die, having heard a horror story from the store owners earlier, he pleads with his friends to suck out the poison. After a short argument, Mitch prepares himself mentally and is about to do it when he finds a cactus spine embedded in Phil's butt cheek. Phil gets emotional when he realizes what his best friend was willing to do to save him. The journey resumes and soon they find more road indicators featured on the map letting them know they're on the right path.\n\nAs they're having a lunch break, they are interrupted by the store owners who show up with guns to steal the map. They surrender the copy of the map and the store owner ties them up. Just as they're poised to kill them however, a familiar face appears and fights them off. Mitch assumes his thoughts that Curly was not dead are correct, but their savior is actually Duke (Jack Palance), Curly's identical twin brother. Duke reveals he was indeed on the train and outside Mitch's house that night. He explains that long ago, their father had plans to find the gold with his sons once he was no longer being monitored, but he died before it could happen and without ever telling his sons about the map. On her death bed, a year ago, their mother gave Curly the map, and he contacted Duke to come find him so that they could seek the gold together, but he then died shortly after. Duke learned from Curly's friend Cookie that Mitch had taken Curly's belongings, and so sought him out to get the map and claim his family's treasure. Duke then asks for the map but Glen tells him the store owners took it from them. Fortunately, Mitch reveals they took a copy of the map that will only lead them to the closest highway, which causes another row with Glen, and gives the real map to Duke. Duke takes the map and sends them away, intending to find the treasure on his own much to their disappointment. In a moment of courage, Mitch chastises Duke for his attitude, reasoning that Curly would not approve. Mitch explains that Curly was a friend and how Curly explained his philosophy about life ('One thing, just one thing'). Surprised that Curly told Mitch about his \"one thing\" philosophy, Duke realizes Mitch was someone Curly must've liked. Out of respect for Curly's memory, Duke agrees to let Mitch, Phil and Glen join him, provided that Duke gets half and the three of them have to split the other half amongst themselves.\n\nOn the road, Duke reveals that, while Curly was in love with the land and cattle driving, he was in love with the sea and spent most of his life in the Navy and then working on all kinds of ships and boats, having traveled the world several times . As they're riding, Mitch sees a wild white stallion just like the one he rode in his dream. Feeling he should ride with it, Mitch chases it for a while until he's able to touch it, feeling elated from the experience. Unfortunately, the scared stallion soon returns with a whole mob of wild horses and Mitch and his friends get caught up in a stampede which destroys most of their supplies and equipment. Mitch is able to save Glen's life which draws them closer. However, Duke reveals that the stampede caused him to loose the map. It also destroyed Mitch's cell phone which guarantees Barbara is about to find out Mitch did not go to the business convention. Things seem grim until Glen tells the others that due to his photographic memory, he's able to recall the last part of the map. With no other choice but trusting Glen or heading back to Las Vegas, Mitch decides to give Glen a chance and the group resume their journey.\n\nThat night, they get caught up in a cold storm. Out of matches and supplies, the men are desperate to keep warm and not freeze to death when Phil suggests they cuddle together to share their body warmth. Mitch invites Duke to join them but he adamantly refuses. Duke then asks Mitch if Curly ever spoke about him to which Mitch has to admit he never did. Duke then asks if Curly died happy which Mitch confirms he died doing what he loved best. Duke then reveals he had not seen Curly for a very long time but is still sad to have lost his brother. He then reveals that he lost his boat two years ago and have been working at a seafood restaurant impersonating a happy pirate which he absolutely hates. The reason he is so passionate about finding the gold is because it would allow him to retire at sea, his one last dream.\n\nThe next morning, having survived the cold, Duke pulls a prank on Mitch by pretending to have died just like Curly. He then shows Mitch that Glen was right about the last part of the map as he can see the \"buffalo's back\" and the \"frozen people\" Glen was recalling from the map. They find a cave and, after a little fright and more shenanigans, they find a chest filled with gold bullion. As they're celebrating their discovery, they find themselves set upon by bandits. A fight ensues and Glen gets shot while trying to save Mitch. However, Duke soon realizes the bullets were blanks with paint pellets. Just then, another familiar face shows up: Clay Stone (Noble Willingham), who was in charge of the cattle drive ranch where Curly worked and where Mitch and his friends went the year before.\n\nClay reveals that the gold is just lead covered in gold paint and the bandits are actually his sons acting their part. He explains that he invested in one of Curly's idea to take tourists out on a western treasure hunt adventure. The tourists were given printed copies of a similar map Curly had in his hat. Stone also reveals that Curly used to come to the same cave often but never found anything, hence why he allowed Stone to copy the map. Duke inquires as to why Curly would tell him they would get rich to which Clay Stone explains that the endeavor promised to be quite lucrative and Curly wanted to give Duke a piece of the action. The four men are quite brokenhearted that their whole journey turned out to be fake and they were dumb enough to believe it, especially Duke.\n\nWith nothing left to find, Duke thanks Mitch for being Curly's last friend and parts ways with the three men, having decided to keep looking for the gold. Before he leaves, he reveals he never understood Curly's \"one thing\" philosophy, which Mitch explains. Mitch, Phil and Glen then reflect on their adventure and realize they are quite proud of what they've accomplished even though the treasure was not real. They did it on their own, without luxuries, and they all found true values in themselves as they all tried to save each other's life at one point or another. Mitch tells Glen he is proud of him for the first time in his life which draws the brothers even closer.\n\nMitch returns to Las Vegas, preparing for a night of trying to reconcile with his wife after having explained everything to her. However, he is surprised when Duke shows up in his hotel room. Duke reveals he finally found his \"one thing\" in life and it is honesty. He reveals he was planning to cheat Mitch, Phil and Glen out of the gold all along but found himself unable to. He then reveals a secret he had purportedly kept from the other three: the map that Curly had, which was also used as a tourist attraction, had a corner missing. Duke then provides the missing corner, revealing that his mom had given the map to Curly but had taken out the last part and sent it to Duke to make sure the brothers would have to reunite if they ever wanted to seek the treasure. The missing piece reveals that, in 1909, Lincoln Washburn had relocated the treasure further away into the mountains where Curly's map stopped. Mitch thinks that Duke is just messing with him, until Duke produces a solid gold bar...the real thing. He then adds: \"It's got friends!\" Mitch and Duke starts singing \"come and get me\" as the two celebrate having found the real treasure."

    "City on Fire": "In a present-day nameless American city, Dr. Frank Whitman (Barry Newman) arrives for work as chief surgeon at Brockhurst Hospital, a newly constructed facility downtown. Although the hospital is open for business, head nurse Andrea Harper (Shelley Winters) complains about a generator that is not fully operational.\n\nMeanwhile, a twice-widowed and wealthy heiress named Diana Brockhurst-Lautrec (Susan Clark), whose $3 million dollar endowment made the hospital possible, arrives in town for the dedication ceremony. In her hotel suite, Diana greets Mayor William Dudley (Leslie Nielsen), who is eager to resume his extramarital affair with her, while she appears ambivalent. From a rooftop across the street, freelance celebrity photographer Terry James (Terry Haig) takes a snapshot of the mayor kissing Diana.\n\nAt the studios of CFTM-Channel 10 television, alcoholic host Maggie Grayson (Ava Gardner) reports on the top news stories, including coverage of the hospital dedication.\n\nElsewhere in the city, Herman Stover (Jonathan Welsh) arrives for work at the Manson Refinery, the ninth largest oil refinery in the world, where he has worked for the last 12 years since it's opening. That morning, he hopes for promotion to foreman, but instead the supervisor Mr. Clark (Earl Pennington) offers him a position in Research and Development. Upset, Stover angrily declines the transfer and Mr. Clark rudely lays Stover off.\n\nWhile cleaning out his locker, Stover admires an old newspaper clipping he saved about Diana Brockhurst-Lautrec, who has become an obsession for him. Although he does not know Diana, Stover brags to an uninterested co-worker that he and Diana grew up in the same poor neighborhood and attended Sycamore High, before she married a wealthy, older man. Tired of being ignored, Stover decides to get the attention of Diana and everyone else by sabotaging the refinery. He quickly runs through the plant, adjusting dials and levers. Soon, the operators in the control room notice unusual smoke patterns from the stacks and an increase in the pressure gauges. As alarms sound, Stover continues to inflict damage by opening fuel pipes.\n\nBefore the dedication ceremony, Dr. Whitman takes a moment to reunite with Diana, a former lover with whom he still has a rapport, and then complains to Mayor Dudley, blaming city politics for the unfinished hospital construction.\n\nLeaving the refinery, Herman Stover changes into a new suit and appears at the outdoor dedication in time for Diana's speech. Meanwhile, engineers stabilize the refinery, but the fuel leakage remains undetected and pours into the city's sewer system. When two welders begin work inside a disposal area, their torches ignite a fire, engulfing them in flames. The blaze quickly spreads through the sewer and causes a chain of explosions that completely destroy the refinery and all the workers in it. The massive blasts are felt as violent tremors throughout the city, collapsing buildings and triggering additional fires.\n\nTaking charge, Dr. Whitman instructs the crowd at the ceremony to help move the injured into the hospital and implements an emergency plan for the facility. Unable to reach the mayor, Fire Chief Risley (Henry Fonda) assumes command and issues orders to mobilize the National Guard and tanker planes.\n\nTrapped at the hospital with no working telephone and an ailing colleague, Mayor Dudley, who has ambitions to be governor, worries about the political fallout from the crisis since he supported the refinery despite public protests about its dangerous proximity to the city.\n\nAs burn victims crowd the corridors, Dr. Whitman instructs Nurse Harper to clear out non-essential personnel to make room for incoming wounded. Meanwhile, Diana does her best to assist the medical staff, while Stover remains near and also volunteers, hoping that Diana will notice him.\n\nFrom the television studio, Maggie reports that the casualties number over 3,000, water pressure is falling due to the lingering summer-long drought and looting has begun. The photographer, Terry James, is badly injured after retrieving the pictures of Diana and the mayor from his burning darkroom. As Terry is loaded into an ambulance, the envelope of photos remains tucked underneath his shirt and later falls into Stover's hands after Terry dies at Brockhurst Hospital.\n\nAt Fire Headquarters, while updating a councilman (Cec Linder) about the nearly 200 fires burning across the city, Risley emphasizes that the people at Brockhurst are at risk of suffocating from the firestorm, which will siphon oxygen from the air. Risley's office contacts the television news crew on the roof to set up a broadcast signal with the mayor, who confirms that breathing is becoming more difficult. Then, a series of explosions occur, destroying a supply truck and making the street leading to the hospital impassable for rescue vehicles.\n\nSince the fast and changing winds prevent the use of helicopters, Risley devises a plan for firefighters to create a \"water tunnel\" outside the facility. However, the hospital's fire hoses must cover the first 100 yards from the doors. As people leave the hospital, the mayor soaks everyone with water, including those on stretchers, so that they will have some protection from the uncontrollable flames in the streets until they reach the firemen's tunnel. Tirelessly, Dr. Whitman directs the medical staff and patients towards the exit while continuing to treat the injured.\n\nIn another area of the hospital, Diana assists Mrs. Adams, who is about to give birth. During the delivery, Stover approaches Diana to discuss the incriminating photographs, and she promptly dismisses him. As the final group of evacuees gather at the door, Dr. Whitman finds Diana with Mrs. Adams and her newborn baby and prepares them for evacuation. Feeling rejected amid all his efforts, Stover walks out in a daze and is killed when a scaffolding collapses. Nurse Harper tries to save him, but is also struck down and killed by burning debris. As the last person to leave the hospital, Dr. Whitman must roll in puddles to keep his clothing wet when the water from the hose runs out, and he is nearly trapped by flames on the street, but Mayor Dudley guides him toward an opening before the hospital explodes.\n\nLater a day or so later, at the rescue camp in a quarry outside the destroyed city, Mayor Dudley's reputation is restored when Maggie calls him a \"hero\" on television, though the Mayor insists that the townspeople themselves are the real heroes. Nearby, Diana and Dr. Whitman kiss and renew their relationship.\n\nIn the final scene, Chief Risley, as he leaves headquarters, declares to the staff that it takes one person to set fire and destroy an entire city."

    "Clash of the Titans": "Clash of the Titans (2010) is set in the Greek city of Argos, where a war is about to explode between man and the gods. A narration introduces the three Olympians who battled the Titans long ago: the brothers Zeus (Liam Neeson), Poseidon (Danny Huston), and Hades (Ralph Fiennes). Hades provided the means of defeating the Titans with his creation, the Kraken. After the Titans' defeat, Zeus created humans and ruled them while Poseidon ruled the sea, but Hades, having been deceived by Zeus, was forced to rule the Underworld. Zeus and Poseidon gain power from the prayers of humans, but Hades learns another way: fear.\n\nA fisherman named Spyros (Pete Postlethwaite) finds a coffin adrift in the sea, discovering a baby, Perseus, and his dead mother, Dana\u00eb (Tine Stapelfeldt), inside. Spyros decides to raise Perseus as his own. Years later, Perseus (Sam Worthington) and his family are fishing when they witness a group of soldiers from Argos destroying a statue of Zeus as a declaration of war against the gods. Hades appears and commands harpies to massacre the soldiers before he himself destroys Perseus's family's fishing boat. Perseus tries to save his family, but to no avail.\n\nThe surviving soldiers take Perseus back to Argos. During a feast for the returning soldiers King Kepheus (Vincent Regan) and Queen Cassiopeia (Polly Walker and Katherine Loeppky) of Argos compare themselves and their daughter, Andromeda (Alexa Davalos), to the gods, much to their daughter's dismay. After convincing his brother to let him loose on humanity to punish Argos for its hubris, Hades appears in the courtroom before killing the remaining soldiers while Perseus is unaffected. Revealing Perseus to be the demigod son of Zeus, and aging Cassiopeia to death, Hades threatens that if Princess Andromeda is not sacrificed to the Kraken, Argos will be destroyed in 10 days. Hermes (Alexander Siddig), the messenger god, approaches Zeus on Olympus, revealing the location of his son Perseus. Hermes suggests offering Perseus sanctuary, but Zeus declares that he shall be left to his fate, along with the other infidel mortals.\n\nThe king seeks the help of Perseus after he is placed in the dungeon. Perseus refuses until he meets Io (Gemma Arterton), a woman who does not age as punishment for refusing to be seduced by a god. Io reveals that Perseus' conception was a punishment conducted by Zeus on Acrisius (Jason Flemyng), the former king of Argos who was married to Dana\u00eb, for his actions against the gods. When Acrisius set Dana\u00eb and the baby Perseus adrift in their coffin, an enraged Zeus struck Acrisius with lightning, leaving him hideously disfigured. After learning that killing the Kraken would allow him to have his revenge against Hades, Perseus agrees to help. He and Argos' finest soldiers embark on a quest to find the Stygian Witches with a pair of Persian monster-hunters named Ixas (Hans Matheson) and Kucuk (Mouloud Achour), and Io following. To counter this turn of events, Hades enlists Acrisius, now called Calibos, to kill off Perseus. Hades imbues Calibos with superhuman powers.\n\nIn the woods, Perseus and his men discover a sword forged in Olympus that will only display power if it is wielded by Perseus. While separated from the group, Perseus encounters Zeus' sacred herd of flying horses, the Pegasus. However, Perseus refuses both the sword and the pure-black Pegasus that the gods offer as assistance, as he does not wish to be a god. Calibos attacks the group and tries to murder Perseus, killing several soldiers in the process, but Calibos is unsuccessful, losing his hand before escaping. However, Calibos's blood forms giant scorpions from the sand that attack Perseus and his group. Though they kill several scorpions, most of the group are slain, and the survivors are surrounded by more of the monsters. They are saved by the Djinn, a band of once-human desert sorcerers who have replaced their earthly flesh with ash and dark magic. The mysterious beings are able to hypnotize the scorpions into submission. Though not trusted prior to healing Perseus's wound, the Djinn leader, Sheikh Suleiman (Ian Whyte), joins Perseus's group. The Djinn want to see the gods' wish for destruction fail.\n\nThe heroes arrive at Garden of Stygia, learning from the Stygian Witches that the head of the Gorgon Medusa (Natalia Vodianova) could kill the Kraken, but that Perseus and his group will die in the process. After leaving the witches, with the hunters taking their leave, Perseus is visited by Zeus who offers him asylum on Mount Olympus, but he refuses. Zeus gives him instead a golden drachma, which Perseus later learns is a means to bribe Charon for passage into the Underworld. While Io remains outside Medusa's lair, due to a spell that forbids any woman from entering the area, Perseus' remaining soldiers fight hard to stay alive but are turned to stone one by one by her gaze. But with Suleiman self-destructing and Draco's sacrifice, Perseus manages to behead Medusa and her stumbling body falls into a fire. Perseus emerges in time to see Calibos kill Io by stabbing her from behind. Perseus engages Calibos in combat and kills him using the sword from Olympus, turning him back into Acrisius in human form. With his final breath as Hades's power leaves him, Acrisius tells Perseus to never become a god. Perseus stays with the dying Io until she passes on, then rides Pegasus back to Argos with Medusa's head to find some of Argos' citizens have formed a cult of Hades and are planning to sacrifice Andromeda to the Kraken against the king's wishes. By then, Hades reveals to Zeus the destruction of Argos will give him enough power to overthrow the other Olympians before leaving his powerless brother to ensure his victory.\n\nPerseus returns to Argos, but Hades sends his harpies to stop him. Perseus defeats the creatures sent by Hades and uses the head of Medusa to turn the Kraken into stone as Kepheus is killed by the cult leader, who is then crushed under the shattering Kraken. Hades appears and sneers that Perseus cannot kill him, since he is a god. Perseus retorts that while Hades can live forever, it will not be in the world of men and uses the sword to banish Hades back to the Underworld. Because Perseus has saved Argos from destruction, Andromeda suggests that Perseus become king and rule Argos at her side, but he declines. Zeus appears before Perseus again and offers to make him a god, but for a second time he refuses. Zeus warns Perseus that Hades will return to rule the world in darkness when he amasses enough fear from mankind. Since Perseus is intent on staying on Earth, Zeus resurrects Io, and the two embrace while Pegasus flies above them."

    "Class of '83": "Class of 83, which is based on a book authored by leading crime journalist Hussain Zaidi, is set in Bombay in the 1980s when the underworld's stranglehold on the city was becoming hard to break. Dozens of young men rendered jobless as a result of the ongoing mill strike were being lured into joining local gangs, and the nexus between powerful politicians and criminal gang leaders made it hard for the police to weed out the problem. With this as the backdrop, the film follows an ideological cop-turned-trainer who molds five cadets into encounter specialists.\n\nYanked off the field for doing his job with more integrity than those in power would like him to, upright officer Vijay Singh (Bobby Deol) lands a 'punishment posting' as the dean of the Police Training Centre in Nashik. Convinced that the only way to restore order in a flawed system is to fix it from the inside, he handpicks a clutch of bold young officers and trains them to bend the law in service of the larger good. Mangesh Dixit (Vishwajeet Pradhan) is the PT and weapons inspector. YP Mathur (Hans Dev Sharma) is the law professor. Class of 83 is Vijay's first batch and in 1st semester he has not taken even a single class. The 3 losers from 1st semester are Vishnu Varde (Hitesh Bhojraj), Aslam Khan (Sameer Paranjape) and Pramod Shukla (Bhupendra Jadawat). Laxman Jadhav (Ninad Mahajani) and Janardan Surve (Prithvik Pratap) came in last, just behind the trio.\n\nThe trio decide to beat up Dixit for humiliating them and enter his house at night but are beaten by Vijay. The next day Vijay asks the entire class to interrogate the trio to prove that they hatched a plan together. The trio make a credible lie to escape detection but are caught as their night suits didn't have dirt on them. Vijay advises them to look into the details before lying. It is revealed that Vijay had a suicide attempt recently and hence missed the 1st semester. Dixit now stays with him. Sudha (Geetika Tyagi) was his wife who died due to an illness. His son Rohan is angry at Vijay for prioritizing his duty over the health of his mother.\n\nVijay takes the 5 lowest cadets under his wings. He teaches them practical applications of police law and techniques rather than focusing on the theory. The 5 still do badly in exams. Vijay reveals that in 1981 he was after foreign terrorist Kalsekar who was bringing drugs and gold into Bombay to fund his activities. Vijay planned a raid with the permission of Minister Manohar Patkar (Anup Soni). Kalsekar escaped the raid and Vijay suspects Patkar. Patkar punishes Vijay by putting him in the training academy. He tells his cadets to kill every member of the Kalsekar gang, who is now outside India, to rid the city of Bombay from their decease. the 5 friends graduate, and Vijay looks forward to great deeds from them.\n\nVijay uses his connections in the force to create a special unit of police designed to institutionalize the killing of gang members and eliminating the evidence trail so that nothing reaches the top echelons of the political system. Bombay is witnessing a turbulent change as mill workers are striking on behalf of their unions. Unions are in cahoots with the gang owners who want to take over mill land for their real estate value. The special unit comes into existence (DGP Raghav Desai pitches the idea to CM Patkar, to eliminate Kalsekar's rivals in Mumbai and says some members of Kalsekar would also have to be killed to make it look legit) and the 5 friends from academy are re-united.\n\nThe team has their 1st success when they kill Ismail Pathan in a chance encounter. Ismail handles money transfer to Kalsekar in Dubai and with Ismail gone, Kalsekar will be starved of funds. The encounter Ismail and make it look like a complete chance. The police higher ups can't do anything. Slowly the 5-start eliminating the small-time members of Kalsekar's gang. Soon ego issues arise when Verde belittles Shukla achievements and says he hasn't conducted as many encounters as he claims. Due to this Shukla joins Kalsekar gang and Verde joins the Naik gang. Kalsekar and Naik are rivals in Bombay in 1988. Shukla and Verde's fight leads to the death 3 innocent businessmen in the city. Patkar orders Desai to bring back Vijay to control his cadets.\n\nVijay takes the job and meets his cadets who are not super confident and tell Vijay that they are taking money from gangsters to build a nest egg in case they are given a punishment posting like him. Vijay trusts only Aslam and asks him to re-start operations against Kalsekar's gang. Aslam gets success using Vijay's informant network. In response Kalsekar kills Aslam via his henchman Shetty. Verde and Shukla meet Vijay and vow to avenge Aslam by harming Kalsekar. Vijay decides to trust them one last time. They abduct Kalsekar's daughter who stays with his sister Najma in Bombay. Kalsekar is forced to return to Bombay. The meeting takes place on a ship, where Vijay kills Kalsekar and several of his henchmen with the help of Verde and Shukla."

    "Clear and Present Danger": "The discovery of the murder of an American businessman, Peter Hardin, and his family, outrages U.S. President Edward Bennett (Donald Moffat), Hardin's personal friend. When Hardin is found to have been connected to a Colombian drug cartel, from which he skimmed over $650 million, Bennett tells James Cutter (Harris Yulin), his National Security Advisor, that the cartels represent a \"clear and present danger\" to the United States, tacitly instructing him to use force against the men responsible for his friend's murder.\n\nJack Ryan (Harrison Ford), appointed acting Deputy Director of Intelligence after Vice Admiral Jim Greer (James Earl Jones) is stricken with cancer, asks Congress for increased funding for ongoing CIA operations in Colombia, believing the funds to be for advisory purposes only. The congress is concerned that FBI has asked for similar funding increases in the past to carry out covert military ops against state enemies. But Ryan gives a personal assurance that that's not the case. $75M is issued.\n\nKeeping Ryan in the dark, Cutter turns to CIA Deputy Director of Operations Bob Ritter (Henry Czerny) to take down the cartel. Ritter insists on Cutter giving him a written authorization before he conducts any covert operations on foreign soil. Ritter assembles a black operations team code named RECIPROCITY with the help of John Clark (Willem Dafoe). Clark also knows this is black ops and demands payment into his bank account before he moves. The whole thing has been hidden from the US Congress. The team inserts itself into Colombia, with Clark running logistics and Captain Ricardo Ramirez (Benjamin Bratt) of a SF-ODA team commanding the squad on the ground in clandestine search-and-destroy missions against the drug cartel. Their teams carries out several hits on planes full of drugs, planning to ship to the US. All of them belong to Escobedo.\n\nRyan finds that 3 years ago Hardin received a large infusion of foreign capital that he invested in shopping malls in US and posted record profits. It is clear to Ryan that Hardin was laundering money for the Columbian drug cartels. Meanwhile, Bennett sends Ryan to Colombia to investigate Hardin's cartel connection and also to retrieve the $650MM sitting in Hardin's offshore accounts. Ryan would need to establish who Hardin was working for, before US Govt can seize the money. Greer knows that Ryan has been trapped and tells him to lean on Clark in case he gets into a mess. Jean Fowler (Belita Moreno) is the FBI officer in charge in Bogota and tells Ryan about Escobedo's operations including Cortez (for whom they don't have a picture). Ryan meets Clark, but Clark doesn't tell Ryan about the hits. Clark takes Ryan seriously when he says he is Geer's man.\n\nThe cartel leader responsible for Hardin's murder, Ernesto Escobedo (Miguel Sandoval), is enraged when the U.S. attempts to claim the $650 million that was stolen from him, and has his intelligence officer, F\u00e9lix Cortez (Joaquim De Almeida), try to retrieve the funds. Cortez did not agree with Escobedo's strategy to kill Hardin since he was a politically connected figure in the US. Cortez visits US and has a new connection Moria Wolfson (Ann Magnuson) whom he uses as cover for his spying activities. Cortez is careful to hide himself from Moria's friends whenever he meets her. Moria is on Jack Ryan's FBI team investigating the Hardin murders. Meanwhile Ramirez's team starts cleaning out Escobedo's cocaine factories hidden in the jungles.\n\nBennett sends FBI Director Emil Jacobs (Tom Tammi) to meet Ryan in Colombia and negotiate with the Columbian Govt for the money (after Ryan had told Bennett that the link between Escobedo and Hardin was established (Hardin was buying coffee from Escobedo, but was paying $6200 per pound), but Columbia would want to keep a large portion of the funds), and when Cortez discovers this (from Moria, whole unwittingly discloses Jacobs plans to Cortez), he plans an ambush, engineering it so that suspicion will fall on Escobedo. Ryan barely escapes the ambush by cartel hit-men (Cortez kills Moria after travelling to the US), but the remainder of the entourage is killed. Ryan returns to the US. Escobedo then summons a meeting with other cartel leaders, which Clark's team hits with an airstrike, but Escobedo is late arriving and survives. Several women and children also die in the attack.\n\nRyan finds it strange that Moria was killed the same day as Emil. He checks her answering machine and finds a recorded message from a Latin sounding guy. Sound analysis provides a match with Cortez. Ryan also finds that Ritter ordered the airstrike on the cartel meeting.\n\nCortez discovers the American involvement in the strike and meets with Cutter (he faxes Cutter that he knows American troops are in Columbia fighting an illegal war and threatens to expose it) to broker a deal (Meeting happens in Panama). Cortez will assassinate Escobedo and take over the cartel, promising to reduce drug shipments to the U.S. and allow American law enforcement to make regular arrests to make it appear as if the U.S. is winning the drug war. In exchange, Cutter will shut down all U.S. operations in Colombia and allow Cortez to hunt down Clark's soldiers. Cutter agrees and orders Ritter to get rid of all evidence of their operations and cut off the troops in Colombia from all support. Ryan is played a recording of the conversation between Cutter and Cortez. He hacks Ritter's computer and discovers the conspiracy unfolding in Colombia.\n\nThe Reciprocity team is ambushed in Colombia by Cortez's mercenaries. Ritter had shut down the satellite link so Clark could not contact the men as they screamed for help. Cutter and Ritter tell Clark that Ryan found out everything and threatened to expose them if they didn't shut it down. They say that Ryan is on his way to Bogota and if Ryan is out of the way, they are back online. Basically, Ritter and Cutter recruit Clark into killing Ryan for them.\n\nRyan arrives and convinces Clark to allow him to help. Clark calls Ritter and says he killed Ryan and wants the satellites turned back on. But Ritter hangs up on him, proving Ryan's point. They find the team's sniper (Ryan buys a helicopter for $2MM and goes searching in the jungles with Clark), Chavez (Raymond Cruz), who tells them that Ramirez and a squad mate have been captured and the remainder have been killed. Ryan visits Escobedo's mansion and shares his intelligence on Cortez. Enraged, Escobedo confronts Cortez, but is killed by Cortez's associate. Ryan, Clark, and Ch\u00e1vez rescue the prisoners, kill Cortez, and escape.\n\nRyan confronts the President and tells him he intends to inform the Congressional Oversight Committee about the conspiracy despite the damage it could do to his career. As he walks out of the Oval Office, Cutter asks to speak with him, but Ryan ignores him. Ryan then begins his testimony to Congress."

    "Cliffhanger": "Rangers Gabriel \"Gabe\" Walker (Sylvester Stallone) and Jessie Deighan (Janine Turner) are dispatched to rescue their friend Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker) and his girlfriend, Sarah (Michelle Joyner), after Hal suffered a knee injury and stranded them on a peak in the Colorado Rockies. As they try to rescue Sarah, part of her harness breaks. Although Gabe is initially able to grab her, her gloved hand slips out and she falls to her death. Hal blames Gabe for Sarah's death and Gabe is overcome with guilt, taking an extended leave.\n\nEight months later, Gabe returns to the ranger station to gather his remaining possessions and persuade Jessie to leave with him. While there, they receive a distress call from a group of stranded climbers. Hal goes to locate the climbers and Jessie is able to persuade Gabe to help out Hal. Hal remains bitter towards Gabe over Sarah's death, at one point threatening to push Gabe off a ledge. When they find the climbers, they discover the distress call was a fake and are taken prisoner by a ruthless gang of international thieves led by psychotic former Military Intelligence operative Eric Qualen (John Lithgow) and the surviving thieves including brutal Kynette (Leon Robinson), sadistic Delmar (Craig Fairbrass) and pilot Kristel (Caroline Goodall).\n\nQualen, along with turncoat U.S. Treasury agent Richard Travers (Rex Linn), were trying to steal three suitcases full of new bills valuing over $100 million. Travers was in charge of transporting the bills by air, when his boss asked him to give a ride to FBI agent Matheson (Vyto Ruginis). As Matheson notices another plane approaching mid-air, Travis shoot him dead. The 2 planes sync up and Travis sets up a transfer line between the 2 planes to transfer the money, himself and the pilot. Travis makes it across, the money is mid-air. But Their escape plan backfired when supposedly dead Matheson shoots and damages the hydraulics & kills the pilot of the US treasury plane (which explodes), sending the hijacker crashing landing onto the mountain top and the money cases all over the mountain range, and they now require Gabe and Hal's help to locate the cases with the help of beacon locators.\n\nAt gunpoint, Hal and Gabe lead them to the first case, located upwards on a steep rock face. Gabe is tethered and forced to climb up the face to reach the case (Qualen also keeps Gabe's jacket for insurance), but when Qualen plans to have Gabe killed once he's got the case, Hal warns him not to come down before Delmar pulls him back and hold him at gunpoint, Qualen orders Kynette and one of the thieves try to yank him down, prompting Gabe to sever the rope. Qualen orders one of the thieves to open fire on Gabe, causing an avalanche that kills one of their members. When they see the money from the first case fluttering away, Qualen believes Gabe is dead, and orders Hal to lead them onward.\n\nGabe races ahead to find Jessie at an abandoned cabin (She had already reached there after she contacted Hal, who gave her a coded message to reach the cabin). They recover old mountaineering gear to reach the second case before Qualen does. By the time Qualen arrives, Gabe and Jessie have emptied the case and left only a single bill with the taunting message \"Want to trade?\" on it. Qualen orders his men to split up, allowing Gabe to dispatch two more of Qualen's men. Night falls on the mountain and both groups take shelter with Gabe & Jessie burning the money to survive while Hal and the group shelter at the cabin.\n\nNext morning, Hal sees two friends, Evan (Max Perlich) and Brett (Trey Brownell), he warns them away before Qualen orders his men to open fire. Brett is killed while Evan is wounded, though he manages to ski off the mountain and parachute to safety. Frank, having not heard from Gabe or the others, scouts the mountain in the helicopter, spots Evan's parachute, and is able to get him to safety while contacting the authorities.\n\nGabe tries to beat the other group by taking a short cut through a sinkhole that opens right next to the 3rd location. But he is spotted coming up by one of the mercenaries Ryan (Gregory Scott Cummins) and escapes by falling all the way down. Ryan goes after him, but Gabe manages to kill him after a brutal fight. Gabe attempts to call for help from Frank (Ralph Waite), their rescue helicopter pilot, with the mercenaries' radio, but Hal alerts him to explosives Qualen has rigged above them on the mountain. Gabe and Jessie escape the falling debris in time.\n\nGabe and Jessie beat Qualen to the last case. Meanwhile, the mercenaries flag down Frank in the helicopter, but by the time he realizes it's a trap it is too late, and he is fatally shot by Delmar. While hugging Frank's body, Hal discreetly grabs Frank's knife. Travers is nervous that Qualen will kill him after they find the 3rd case and encodes the monitor. He wants to use the chopper to find the 3rd case, but Kristel says there isn't enough fuel. Qualen kills Kristel so now, even Travers needs Qualen (who is also a pilot) to get off the mountain.\n\nQualen orders Travers & his remaining men to look for the other case. When they get close to the 3rd case, Travers asks Delmar to kill Hal. Hal is able to use the knife to wound Delmar, kill him with his own shotgun, and escape. Gabe asks Jessie to go back to the rescue station & gets to the case first and ties the beacon to a rabbit. Travers goes bonkers and starts cursing Qualen on the open radio frequency. This entire broadcast is heard by Travers's boss, who is also leading a chopper search party to look for the stolen money. Qualen knows that their location is compromised after the broadcast and flies the chopper away.\n\nHal finds Gabe, and together they kill Travers, who is now insane after finding that Gabe managed to get the last case before him. However, at the same time, Qualen takes Jessie hostage when she waves down the helicopter, believing that Frank was flying it. Qualen tells Gabe and Hal over the radio that he is holding Jessie captive on board the helicopter, demanding Gabe and Hal to surrender the money from the third case at a high elevated rendezvous point and threatens to kill her should they refuse to cooperate.\n\nGabe and Hal agree, and they meet at a cliff side bridge. However, Qualen tries to challenge Gabe into throwing the case into the helicopter, but when he also threatens to kill Jessie again, Gabe orders Qualen to free her at a safe distance away from the cliff. Qualen reluctantly agrees and uses a winch to lower Jessie to the ground. Once Jessie is safely down, however, Gabe throws the bag of money into the helicopter's rotors, shredding the money. Enraged, Qualen attempts to use the helicopter to kill Gabe, but Gabe has used the winch cable to tether the helicopter to a steel ladder up the cliff face. Hal arrives and helps via shooting the helicopter down. The ladder snaps and leaves Gabe and Qualen atop the wreckage of the helicopter hanging by the cable.\n\nGabe fights Qualen and manages to climb to safety as the wreckage snaps off the cable, sending Qualen to his death. Gabe reunites with Jessie and Hal as they are found by Treasury agents led by Walter Wright (Paul Winfield) in a helicopter. Wright arranges to send a rescue helicopter as Gabe, Hal, and Jessie are seen sitting on top of a mountain peak, reminiscent of Gabe, Hal, and Sarah at the beginning."

    "Cloak & Dagger": "Davey Osborne (Henry Thomas) is an 11-year-old who lives in San Antonio with his father, Hal Osborne (Dabney Coleman). His mother has recently died, leaving just him and his father, a military air traffic controller who has problems relating to his child. Davey is a lonely child and is still grieving over his mother, so he immerses himself in the fantasy world of Cloak & Dagger, an espionage game which exists in both role playing and video forms. Davey has one friend, Kim, (Christina Nigra) a girl who lives nearby with her single mother. Davey is interested in the world of espionage and his hero is the character Jack Flack from the game. He wants to live an action-packed life like Jack Flack and he carries around a water pistol as his \"gun\" and a softball as his \"grenade\". Davey spends much of his free time playing Cloak & Dagger and spinning elaborate fantasies involving Jack Flack, an imaginary friend who takes the form of a more dashing version of his father (the role of Flack is also played by Coleman).\n\nOne day Davey's friend Morris (William Forsythe), who owns a video game shop in the local mall, sends Davey and Kim on an errand, where Davey witnesses a murder. Right before the victim dies, he gives Davey a Cloak & Dagger video-game cartridge and says that the cartridge contains important military secrets, that he must get it to the FBI. Davey seeks help from the authorities but they simply believe him to be engaging in fantasy play.\n\nMurderous spies, led by the malevolent Dr. Rice (Michael Murphy), chase Davey relentlessly as he flees across the city. The action moves from Davey's house, to a series of tour boats, to the Alamo. Along the way Davey manages to continually evade his pursuers with the aid and advice of the imaginary Jack Flack. However, along the way Davey's relationship with Flack becomes more strained as his own sense of morality and concern for his friend Kim collide with Flack's harsh methods and cavalier attitude. This comes to a head when Davey is cornered by Rice along the River Walk.\n\nDuring the fight, Jack Flack urges Davey to set up the two spies into the \"Crossfire Gambit\", causing one to kill the other. Jack convinces Davey to pick up the gun of the dead spy, but rather than shoot Rice, Davey panics and runs away down a dead-end path. Rice arrives and corners Davey. Assuming the gun Davey holds is the same red ink-filled water pistol from earlier, Rice taunts him by threatening to shoot both his kneecaps and stomach and allowing him to die in agony. When Davey proves unable to shoot first, Jack Flack tries to get Rice's attention. Standing in front of a blank wall (and holding his Agent-X bulletproof beret in front of him for protection), Jack dares Rice to shoot him. Davey looks to Jack, warning him not to do anything, and Rice instinctively turns and fires a burst at the wall, thinking \"Jack\" is a hidden ally. An enraged Davey fires his pistol, killing Rice and causing him to fall dead into the river.\n\nRealizing that Jack had tricked him into shooting the spy, Davey throws away the pistol, pulls the miniature of Jack Flack out of his pocket and, with a shout of \"I don't want to play anymore!\" breaks the miniature in two, stomping it into the concrete. Jack Flack tells Davey his father behaved the same way at his age, growing tired of playing \"Cowboys and Indians\". As he speaks, blood begins to pour from the bullet holes that now riddle his body, and Jack abruptly collapses. While expressing regret about the rule, \"...leaving when they stop believing,\" Jack confesses Davey was always his favorite playmate. Distracting Davey by asking for a smoke, Jack fades away into nothing. When Davey calls to Jack, saying he can't do it alone, Jack's voice reassures him that he always could, and tells him to go save Kim.\n\nEarlier in a scene at the Alamo, Davey had been befriended by a kind elderly couple. Seemingly the only adults to believe him, or at least the only ones who are willing to humor his adventures, the couple turn out to be enforcers working for the spies. Davey manages to escape their clutches, but without the game cartridge, and he chases the couple to the airport where they are attempting to flee the country. At the airport, Davey forces the couple's hand by pretending that they are his parents and that they are abandoning him. When security attempts to intervene, Davey tells the guard the proof is the game cartridge he knows they have. Cornered, the couple kidnaps Davey at gunpoint and commandeers a plane, unaware that Davey has brought with him a bomb which the spies had meant to use to kill Kim. Unwilling to listen to Davey about the bomb, the couple requests a pilot. Meanwhile, Hal has arrived at the airport with Kim's mother, and after hearing about the hostage situation, he volunteers to be the pilot. As the plane moves to the runway, Davey tries to summon Jack for help; his father hears him and identifies himself as \"Jack Flack\" and calls Davey to the cockpit. When the female enforcer shows up to bring him, she discovers the bomb and panics, calling for her husband. As the two enforcers try to disable the bomb, Davey and his father manage to escape safely from the cockpit; the plane travels a short distance before exploding, killing the enforcers and incinerating the cartridge. The film ends with the two reunited and Davey insisting he no longer needs Jack Flack because he has his father."

    "Close": "Whilst in South Sudan on a routine mission, close protection officer Sam Carlson (Noomi Rapace) saves two journalists she is protecting, when their vehicle is attacked by local insurgents. Zoe Tanner (Sophie Nelisse), the troubled child and heir of recently deceased business tycoon Eric Tanner, discovers she has been left all of her father's shares in his company, Hassine Mining. This shocks and angers her stepmother, Rima Hassine (Indira Varma), whose family founded the company and who has taken over Eric's position as CEO. Having succeeded in negotiating a billion-dollar deal for phosphate mining in Zambia, Rima demands that Zoe accompany her to the family house in Morocco whilst she completes the deal.\n\nRima hires Sam to act as Zoe's bodyguard for the trip, as her previous male bodyguard was fired for having sex with Zoe. Upon arriving at the family's fortified Kasbah in Morocco, Zoe demands that Sam remain for the full time she has been paid and stay the night. Later that evening, the safe-house's security system is breached, locking the property down and trapping its inhabitants. The intruders kill multiple members of the security team. The heavily armed intruders make their way to Zoe's room and kill the head of security, Alik (Akin Gazi), in route.\n\nZoe escapes with Sam, and they are picked up by responding police officers. Although the officers assure them, they are being taken to a police station, Zoe (who speaks Arabic) overhears them discussing a private address and money. Sam fights and disarms the officers, but Zoe ends up shooting one of them with Sam's sidearm. The two escape on foot into Casablanca and take refuge in a hotel. News of the incident causes share prices in Hassine Mining to drop considerably, potentially enabling their competitor Sikong to steal the deal from under Hassine for the mining business in Zambia.\n\nZoe calls Rima for help, but Rima is furious at Zoe for killing a police officer which has caused the share prices to tank. Rima also cancels the insurance policy on Zoe. On live TV, Rima comes under pressure from Sikong that Zoe is a shareholder of Hassine mining and as such the company's owner is implicit in a manslaughter charge. Rima defends that Zoe is not associated with the company yet (as shares have not been transferred yet) and as such Zoe's personal conduct should not impact a business deal. The Zambian company's board tells Rima that they are reconsidering Hassine's offer. Rima makes a call that looks like she ordered a hit on Zoe.\n\nSam is no longer under contract from Hassine and as such decides to save Zoe on her own. Sam promises to get Zoe out of the country and is later joined by her boss Conall (Eoin Macken). Their escape plan is for the three of them to travel as a family to Tangier and take the ferry to Spain. They are ambushed at the hotel by men who kill Conall. Sam saves Zoe from being taken by brutally fighting and killing two of the men.\n\nUnable to leave the country without passports, Sam and Zoe travel to Hassine Mining headquarters to meet Rima. There, they witness her in the car park with one of the suspicious men from the hotel. They follow him to a local marina (there the man from the hotel meets a local policeman. Turns out that the local police was acting for Rima through the man in the hotel as the middleman), but Sam is noticed and the two fight; Sam impales him with a large fishing hook. Looking through his wallet, Sam and Zoe discover he is a police officer and had Rima's login details for the house security system.\n\nWhilst meeting with the selling company, Rima is confronted by a member of the competitor Sikong, who makes further threats on Zoe. Sam and Zoe return to the abandoned safe-house, where Zoe discovers that Sam previously had a child whom she put up for adoption because Sam was only 16 at the time and a kid herself. During a meeting to finalize the mining deal, Rima receives a notification that her phone has been accessed by the house security system (by Zoe, who used Rima's login and password at the house security system to access RIma's phone), and she leaves without signing the mining deal (realizing that Zoe is alive). The house is surrounded by corrupt members of the police (who are actually working for Sikong), who refuse to allow a honest detective from Casablanca working with Rima to enter.\n\nRima arrives by helicopter. She reveals to Zoe that she is being blackmailed (by Sikong) and that she is not responsible for the attempts on her life. She is attacked by the mercenaries and corrupt officers, although Zoe and Sam intervene and eventually save her. Sam is wounded in the wrist. With Zoe and Rima safe, and the threat over, Sam leaves to head home but promises Zoe she will call her daughter."

    "Cloverfield": "The film is presented as found footage from a personal video camera recovered by the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. A disclaimer text states that the footage is of a case designated \"Cloverfield\" and was found in the area \"formerly known as Central Park\". The video consists chiefly of segments taped the night of Friday, May 22, 2009. The newer segments were taped over older video that is shown occasionally.\n\nThe first video segment opens when Rob (Michael Stahl-David) wakes up on the morning of Monday, April 27 having slept with Beth (Odette Yustman), a previously platonic friend. They make plans to go to Coney Island that day. The footage cuts to May 22 6:43 PM, when Rob's brother Jason (Mike Vogel) and his girlfriend Lily (Jessica Lucas) prepare a farewell party for Rob who will be moving to Japan. Their friend Hud Platt uses a camera to film testimonials, after Jason unloaded the task to him. Hud is an amateur, and the video footage he shoots is very jerky and cuts in and out very quickly. Hud has a crush on a mutual friend Marlena of Lily, who is also attending the party. Later in the night, Rob arrives for his surprise party. Rob soon realizes that Hud is using Rob's video camera to shoot the testimonials and that he didn't change the video tape inside, which means he taped over Rob and Beth's trip to Coney Island. In her farewell message, Beth is really distracted on camera. Later, Hud catches Rob and Beth fighting with each other in the hallway. Turns out Beth had not broken up with Travis (Ben Feldman), when she slept with Rob, over a month ago. Beth is still with Travis and Rob is angry about that.\n\nAfter Beth leaves the party, an apparent earthquake strikes, and the city suffers a brief power outage. The local news reports that an oil tanker has capsized near Liberty Island. When the party-goers leave the building, they see the head of the Statue of Liberty crash in the street with several stunning scratch and bite marks. Hud (T.J. Miller) records what appears to be a hand of a large creature several blocks away. A glimpse of a monster is shown that causes the Woolworth Building to collapse. The group decides to exit Manhattan via the Brookly Bridge. Later, a gigantic tail destroys the Brooklyn Bridge, also killing Jason. News reports show the Army National Guard's 42nd Infantry Division attacking the monster and smaller \"parasite\" creatures falling off its body and attacking people.\n\nRob listens to a phone message from Beth saying she is trapped in her apartment and unable to move. Going against the crowd, Rob, Hud, Lily, and Marlena (Lizzy Caplan) (another party guest) venture to Midtown Manhattan to rescue Beth. The monster is shown to be moving between the buildings in Midtown Manhattan, causing widespread damage. They find themselves in a battle between the creature and military, run into the subway station. Rob convinces the group to follow the tunnel tracks to reach a station near Beth's apartment. Inside the tunnels (while navigating using the flashlight from the camera) they are attacked by several of the parasites. While saving Hud, Marlena is bitten by one of the creatures. The four escape the subway and enter an underground mall where Marlena begins to feel unwell. They are found by soldiers and taken to a command center nearby. The soldiers tell the group, that they have not yet identified the monster's origin, and whatever it is, it is winning. When Marlena begins bleeding from her eyes, she is forcibly taken to a field hospital and explodes.\n\nRob, still intending on saving Beth, persuades one of the military commanders to let them go. He is informed when the last evacuation helicopter will depart before the military executes its \"Hammer Down Protocol\", which will destroy Manhattan in its entirety in order to kill the monster. The last helicopters will leave Manhattan at 0600 the next day. The surviving group travel to Beth's apartment building to discover it leaning on a neighboring skyscraper. After crossing roofs from the other building, the group finds Beth impaled on exposed metal construction bar. They free her and make their way to the evacuation site at Grand Central Terminal, where they encounter the creature again.\n\nLily is first rushed into a departing Marine Corps helicopter to escape before the terminal is destroyed. Moments later, Rob, Beth and Hud are taken away in a second helicopter and witness the creature being bombed. The bombing causes the creature to fall, and success is assumed, but then it lunges out of the smoke, hitting the second helicopter and causing it to crash in Central Park, killing all the occupants except Rob, Beth and Hud.\n\nFifteen minutes before the Hammer Down Protocol is to commence, the trio regain consciousness and attempt to flee; Hud turns back to retrieve the camera when the creature suddenly appears and kills him. Rob and Beth grab the camera and take shelter under an arch as sirens blare, and the bombing starts. Rob and Beth each provide their last testimony of the day's events. The bridge begins to crumble, and the camera is knocked out of Rob's hand and buried beneath rubble. Rob and Beth proclaim their love for each other just as the bomb explodes, the camera freezing up before the footage cuts.\n\nThe film ends with the finale of Rob and Beth's trip to Coney Island on Apr 27th, 2009. Unseen by them, an indiscernible object falls from the sky and into the ocean. Just before the camera cuts out, Beth states, \"I had a good day.\"\n\nAfter the credits, a voice can be heard saying, \"Help us...\" When played in reverse, it says, \"It's still alive.\""

    "Cobra": "\"Crime is a disease. Meet the cure.\" Lt. Marion Cobretti, nicknamed Cobra (Sylvester Stallone), is a sun-glass wearing, toothpick chewing cop who is all about getting the criminal and breaking the rules. He has the entire department on his back all the time about his very violent and forceful way of getting the bad guys, normally making the punks end up in a body bag loaded with lead issued from his trusty pearl handled Colt .45.\n\nBut Cobra is set a real challenge when a killer cult is spreading rapidly in the city. The cult kills innocent people, seeming to pick random victims and slaying them with jagged knifes and getting off on the hunted's fear. But they make a huge mistake when they kill a woman at a bus stop and a young model sees them. She doesn't exactly know that they've killed someone, but is extremely scared when one of the killers, a muscle bound and rather deformed looking man, gives her a spine-chilling look. Soon the killers are after her! And they kill her photographer, a security guard and very nearly make her meet their sadistic style of murder. Cobra is soon on the scene, with his partner the junk food loving, Sergeant Gonzales. They ask the young model, whose name turns out to be Ingrid (Brigitte Nielsen), if she saw the killers. She says she only saw some people at the bus stop acting very odd and a man who scared her badly.\n\nBut Cobra's progress into solving the case is halted by the pencil pushing, fat headed Detective Monte, who is always on his case about too much force. He tells Cobra that he's on the Zombie squad for a reason, he's too violent and doesn't please the press. Much too Monte's disgust, the Chief and Captain Sears decided to let Cobra use his street wise talk to fight the killer. Cobra goes through the entire population of the nocturnal seediness of downtown, where all the prostitutes, pimps, bar flies and cons of the city hang out. But he doesn't find any kind of help from these people, they have no idea who the killers are.\n\nCobra soon connects a supermarket killing, that involved a psycho who claimed that he was part of \"the new order\" who would wipe out the weak and make the strong survive, to the mass murders ripping at the soft under belly of the capital. But Detective Monte's smart mouth antics and somewhat spineless Captain Sears try to stop him from using aggressive force, not caring that Ingrid almost got killed by one of the cult followers, Night Slasher and that numerous other people were slayed in the hospital at night. The Captain agrees to let Cobra take Ingrid to the countryside with Gonzales and a female cop named Nancy Stalk. Little does he know that the heat is going to be turned up instead of cooled off when they leave the city. Nancy is in fact a cult member and leading the Night Slasher and his cronies right to where Cobra is taking Ingrid.\n\nWhile in a motel that's off the beaten track, Ingrid and Cobra realize their attraction to one another. The romantic mood is short lived however, and the cult is back on Cobra's trail. They burn down the motel and almost kill Gonzales. Cobra and Ingrid ride off in a pick-up truck and almost meet their end by crashing into a burning car that's blocking the road. Cobra still manages to take some punks down though, with a very nice piece of weaponry called the laser mount sub-machine gun.\n\nThey end up in a chemical factory and finally Night Slasher and Cobra come face to face. In a very psychotic speech Night Slasher says that Cobra's law is weak and that their cult will always survive. This sends Cobra off the deep end and Slasher onto a huge metal hook, that rips through his back and sends him off into a molten vat of metal. Nancy however is still alive and tries to kill Cobra, but she is also killed.\n\nAfter all the bloodshed, Cobra and Ingrid emerged slightly bruised and dirty, from the factory. The Captain congratulates Cobra, but Monte is too proud to actually admit that Cobra one the fight. He picks up his bit about too much excessive force, but earns himself a good punch from Cobra, sending him to the ground stone cold. Ingrid and Cobra ride off on a motorbike into the sunset to Kiss singing \"Can you get enough me baby I can't get enough of you.\" In true Stallone/ Cobra style, the day is saved, and the conveniently pretty chic is too!"

    "Code 8": "In the near future a special city is built of people with special powers called \"powers\" (kind of like mutants). Although they are initially popular in the workforce, as the Third Industrial Revolution begins, Powers are marginalized. A crime syndicate known as The Trust has flooded the streets with an addictive drug called Psyke, made from the spinal fluid of trafficked Powers. The Powers have no other sources of income and are easy targets for The Trust. This results in the government passing a law requiring all Powers to register their abilities. Police departments begin using drone-deployed robots, called Guardians, and facial recognition software to combat Power-related crime while a citywide Powers ban is debated.\n\nConnor Reed (Robbie Amell), as his mother Mary (Kari Matchett) is dying, is desperate for money, more specifically, medical access. Reed is an \"electric\" which means electric currents don't hurt him, while his mother is a Cryo (Cryokinetic), whose ailment impedes her from controlling her powers. Connor picks any odd jobs he can find to keep paying the bills but is falling behind fast. Meanwhile, the police use drones to identify and apprehend unregistered Powers. Officers Park and Davis lead one such unit hunting Powers that are selling their spinal fluid to The Trust. All the spinal fluid confiscated is burned by the Police in the incinerator once a month.\n\nConnor is approached by Garrett (Stephen Amell), Marcus's underling and a TK (Telekinetic), and his crew for a job. The job turns out to be a robbery. Connor is introduced to Marcus Sutcliffe (Greg Bryk) and meets Nia (Kyla Kane), Marcus's apparent girlfriend. Sutcliffe owes money to bigger mafia lord Wesley and needs to make urgent payments. It was Marcus's Psyke farm that was raided a few days ago by cops, and he lost his entire inventory. Wesley refuses to give any leeway and demands payments in a week. Marcus plans something big, and needs Connor, but Garrett wants more time to train Connor, saying that even Connor doesn't know how powerful he is. Garrett uses Connor to cut through electric fences and stuff like that. Small jobs are completed without a hitch. Meanwhile, Nia (Kyla Kane), who exclusively serves Marcus, is a Healer and someone who can save Reed's mother.\n\nPark (Sung Kang) and Davis (Aaron Abrams) arrive at the robbery scene the next day and determine that Marcus is desperate for revenue. Garrett recruits Connor for more jobs while training him to maximize his abilities and agrees to help him earn enough money to get Mary's treatment. Garrett tells Connor that he is a class 5 Electric and not a Class 2 as he has been led to believe. Connor grows close with Garrett's crew - Freddie (Vlad Alexis), a mute Brawn (super strength), and Maddy (Laysla De Oliveira), a Pyro (Pyrokinesis).\n\nMarcus has the crew rob a bank to pay back The Trust, but the vault contains only a tenth of the money they expected. Connor was promised a cut of $25,000 from the bank heist. The vault was supposed to have $500,000 but had only $50,000 and it was cleared at 4 PM the same day, before the heist. Drones reach the bank before the gang can exit, but Connor manages to knock them out with electric bursts. Wesley's (Peter Outerbridge) Shifter (Shape Shifter) assassin, Copperhead (Ess Hodlmose), attempts to kill Marcus for not honoring his debt, but Marcus's bodyguard Rhino, a Brawn with bulletproof skin, kills her. Nia reveals to Connor that she is a Healer, and only remains with Marcus to ease the effects of his Psyke addiction and pay off her imprisoned father's debt. When Nia heals someone, their injuries and diseases simply transfer to her body.\n\nMary's condition worsens, and the doctors tell Connor that they need to operate soon to save her. Park and Davis bring Connor in for questioning. Davis wants to plant evidence against Connor at his home and coerce Connor into snitching against Marcus and Garrett. Park wants to cut him loose due to lack of evidence. Connor is released. He goes to Garrett and suggests they rob the police confiscated Psyke transport, which will make them $10 million. Garrett and Connor bring the idea to Marcus, where Connor demands Nia heal Mary as payment. Garrett wants a 50-50 split with Marcus.\n\nOn the day of the heist, the crew blocks the transport inside a no-fly zone, preventing backup by drones carrying Guardians. Although Garrett's crew manages to retrieve the Psyke non-lethally, Marcus's men execute police officers and betray Garrett and his crew by taking away the Psyke. Marcus's men kill Maddy and fatally wound Freddie. Rhino flees with the drugs. Connor tells Garrett that Marcus framed them because of Garrett's demands, and they part ways.\n\nConnor contacts Park and offers up Marcus's hideout. The cops raid Marcus's hideout while Connor and Garrett fight and kill both Rhino and Marcus. Garrett takes the Psyke and encourages Connor to get Nia. Nia pleads with Connor to let her go, as her abilities force her to take the injury or disease onto herself. Connor takes Nia to the hospital at gunpoint to cure his mother but changes his mind when he sees that curing Mary will kill Nia. Mary passes away soon after.\n\nConnor gives Nia his truck in order to leave the city, while Garrett hands over the Psyke to Wesley and takes over the drug trade for The Trust in Lincoln City. Connor visits his mother's grave before he goes on the run, while Nia has a tearful visit with her father. Meanwhile, the Powers Ban is being voted on while Park reluctantly accepts an award."

    "Code 8 Part II": "Five years following the events of Code 8, the LCPD has reformed their militarized tech program, replacing the majority of their armed humanoid robots (Guardians) with non-lethal companion K9 robots, similar to dogs. Under the leadership of Sergeant Kingston (Alex Mallari Jr.), the project has been a success and the streets have never been safer. Kingston is running for Mayor on back of the success of the project. More than 200 K9 units have been deployed throughout the city. Kingston claims that the K9 units have been programmed not to harm humans and will stand down as soon as the human threat surrenders.\n\n4% of the population has special abilities (Kind of like mutants), and most of them live under the poverty line. They are heavily policed. Initially, the powers helped build the cities of the future, but once robots became a reality, the powers became a threat and outlaws in society. The drug Psyke is manufactured from the spinal fluid of powers.\n\nHaving just got out of prison, Connor (Robbie Amell) works as a janitor at a youth community center, run by Mina (Jean Yoon). There, he keeps his head down and tries to stay out of trouble, leaving his past behind. Connor refuses to have any contact with Garrett even when he comes to pick Connor up from prison. Detective Davis wants Connor to help him get to Garrett.\n\nGarrett (Stephen Amell) has taken control of an apartment complex called Towers where he runs his \"ethical\" drug empire, paying powered people for their spinal fluid to make the drug Psyke. Pavani (Sirena Gulamgaus) and her older brother Tarak live in poverty within this community. Tarak needs money to keep Pavani in school. Tarak works as a drug runner for Garrett, but Garrett refuses to give him any chance to earn some real money.\n\nWhen Tarak's desperation leads him to steal a bag of cash from Garrett's gang, Tarak gets caught by Sgt. King and his unit of corrupt cops, who are being paid off by Garrett. The bag of cash itself was the pay off to the cops. King discovers Tarak near the cash drop off point, prompting Tarak to run. To cover it up, King orders a K9 unit to hunt him down, injecting him with Psyke to make it look like an overdose. Pav witnesses the murder, and using her rare ability, she causes the robotic K9 to malfunction and escapes.\n\nPav finds refuge at the community center, where Connor and Mina help her stay hidden from the LCPD. Pavani and Connor are captured on CCTV escaping the community center. King reaches out to Garrett and says that he wants Pavani dead as she will eventually speak. King attacks Connor's building with Guardian drones and K9s, but they manage to escape by using their powers. Pavani has the ability to distort all electronics in her vicinity.\n\nConnor seeks out Garrett's help, who tells him that Pavani is a Transducer, and that Tarak interrupted an important exchange between Garrett and King. Conner asks Garrett to broker a peace deal, which includes wiping Pav's memory of the murder. But when Connor realizes the mind wiper is erasing every single memory she has of her brother, he fights to break her free.\n\nTurning to Mina, they attempt to flee the city together but get ambushed by Garrett and his crew. During a tense standoff between Connor and Garrett, Garrett cannot bring himself to shoot Connor as he stands in front of Pavani. King monitors the whole situation with drones. Sgt. King deploys robotic Guardians and orders them to kill everyone on site. Mina sacrifices herself so Connor, Pav, and Garrett can escape.\n\nGarrett takes Connor and Pavani to a safe-house which is off grid. Detective Davis (Aaron Abrams) tracks them down and they learn that the only way to expose King for his crime is by breaking into his home and steal his K9 unit (Pavani uses her powers to unlock the K9 unit and to get it to go to sleep), which holds evidence of Tarak's murder in its memory. It is revealed that King also has mutant powers, but he hides it so that he can have position of power in the normal society. After stealing the K9, Connor, Garrett and Pav escape to the Towers. Here, Garrett turns the tables on them, wanting to use the K9 as leverage to hold King and his officers at bay.\n\nKing and the officers surround the Towers and ambush the group after Garrett fails to broker a new deal. King stabs Garrett and mounts an invasion of the Towers. Garrett's co-workers let Connor and Pav escape while they stall the cops by engaging them in battle. A lone K9 goes after them and after a failed electric attack from Connor, Pav unlocks her full power and manages to turn it against the cops. Once outside, they are in a final standoff. Garrett holds off a K9 and King himself until Pav finally manages to broadcast the recordings from King's personal K9, bringing justice for Pav's brother's death.\n\nThree months later, King is arrested and the K9 program is shelved for further inspection. Garrett is in prison and Connor has managed to start up the youth community center with Pav in Mina's honor."

    "Coffee & Kareem": "In Detroit, Officer James Coffee (Ed Helms) goes to his girlfriend Vanessa Manning's (Taraji P. Henson) house during the day, but as they have sex he thinks he sees Vanessa's son Kareem (Terrence Little Gardenhigh) in the house. Vanessa tells him Kareem is at school, and if he doesn't accept Kareem as part of her life they can't be together. Meanwhile, at school, he complains to his friend Dominic (Chance Hurstfield) about seeing his mom dating a white guy and even worse dating a cop, which would be terrible for his aspiring rap career. He resolves to get revenge on Coffee by getting gangsters to mess him up.\n\nDetective Linda Watts (Betty Gilpin) leads a raid on rapper Orlando Johnson (RonReaco Lee) and arrests him in a massive drug bust. Watts lets Coffee take him in the back of his cruiser to go to jail, but Johnson breaks out and steals Coffee's own car out from under him, which goes viral on YouTube. Coffee complains to Captain Hill (David Alan Grier) about Watts's verbal abuse and constant belittling, including bringing up his ex-wife's cheating on him, but Watts continues to chew out Coffee for his incompetence and losing her arrest. Hill reassigns Coffee to traffic cop duty and the whole police station mockingly applauds Coffee on his way out.\n\nVanessa calls Coffee and tells him Kareem asked for him to pick him up from school. Coffee is uncomfortable, but when Vanessa is disappointed he doesn't want to connect with her son, he agrees, but doesn't tell her he's now on traffic duty. After doing a rap as a poetry presentation, Kareem gets picked up by Coffee - where he pretends he's being arrested to look tough in front of his classmates. Kareem is hostile to Coffee, and purposely directs him to drive a boxing gym where he has discovered Orlando Johnson is hiding out. Johnson and his two lackeys Dee and Rodney (William 'Big Sleeps' Stewart, Andrew Bachelor) have a cop tied up and beaten. He tells them that Coffee tried to molest him and he offers them money to beat him up. The cop pleads with them to let him go, that his boss will come after all of them, and Dee shoots the cop to death. Hearing the gunshots, Coffee goes in, leading to a firefight that Coffee and Kareem manage to flee from, breaking into a trunk of a car to hide.\n\nFrom the trunk, Coffee calls Watts and tells her about Orlando, but Kareem realizes the cop that died was a dirty cop and that they can't trust anyone and forces him to hang up. Kareem also realizes he left his phone when they fled, which had his information and video of the murder - he knows his mom might be in danger. They bang on the trunk until the driver pulls over, and they commandeer the car and drive off. They go to Vanessa's place and pretend nothing is wrong, until Vanessa gets an amber alert for Kareem. They turn on the TV and see the news reporting that Coffee had a psychotic break and kidnapped Kareem. Vanessa calls 911, and refuses to leave just as Johnson and his men arrive. Kareem takes Coffee's taser and tasers Vanessa, shocking Coffee, and Coffee carries her as they flee out the back.\n\nThey head to a motel, where on the TV, they see Coffee is now also being framed for the dirty cop's murder. Coffee pleads with Kareem to work with him, and Kareem agrees on the condition that Coffee never see Vanessa again and that he take him to strip club, which he reluctantly agrees to. They leave a note for Vanessa explaining everything and track Kareem's phone to where Johnson is. Kareem counsels Coffee that the way not to get bullied is to be aggressive and very gay, like Mike Tyson. Coffee orders Kareem to stay in the car, but he follows him inside the gang's hideout, where the drugs are being produced. Kareem distracts the guards with dirty talk and Coffee knocks them out, one by one. Coffee encounters Johnson and they get into a huge fight, but Kareem gets Johnson at gunpoint.\n\nThey tie him up, and Coffee tries to interrogate Johnson about the truth behind the drugs and dirty cops. Johnson isn't intimidated by Coffee, but Kareem keeps shit-talking. Finally, Coffee follows Kareem's advice and tells Johnson how he's in love with him - in a more romantic way than Kareem's \"gay and aggressive\" way. Eventually, they realize Kareem's phone is up Johnson's butt. They convince Johnson that the video is the only thing proving he didn't shoot the cop and when they threaten to delete it, Coffee says Watts is the dirty cop running all the drugs. Johnson begs Coffee to protect him - he agrees, and loads Johnson into the trunk of his car. Elsewhere, Dee and Rodney, having been tipped off when the motel clerk called the police, go to Vanessa's motel room to kidnap her.\n\nMeanwhile, Coffee calls Hill and tells him to come meet him in secret. He takes Kareem to a strip club, where he tells Kareem how his own stepdad beat him mom and Hill used to come break it up, and that's when he decided to be a cop. He tells him he doesn't really think he could be a good dad anyway, and has no interest in being Kareem's dad. He also talks to Kareem about girls, and pays a stripper to role play a conversation with him. Hill arrives with Watts, and when Coffee pulls a gun on Watts, Hill pulls a gun on him, revealing himself to also be a dirty cop in on the scheme. Watts shoots Hill in the head, planning to also frame Coffee for that as well. Coffee tries to fight, giving Kareem the chance to free, but Watts shoots him in the shoulder. She holds him at gunpoint and demands Kareem show himself or she'll kill Coffee. Kareem arrives driving Watts's cop car and hits her, and he and Coffee drive away.\n\nWatts finds Johnson in the trunk and orders him to drive that car to chase after them, leading to a long shootout and car chase. Eventually, Kareem's erratic driving causes Watts and Johnson to crash, giving Coffee and Kareem a chance to get away. They go to the motel room where they discover Vanessa has been taken. Kareem is devastated and begins crying, and Coffee tries to console him. Kareem wants to go after him, but when Coffee tries to stop him, they get into a huge fight that ends with Coffee telling Kareem he's going to dump Vanessa anyway - just as Vanessa walks in. Flashbacks reveal that when Dee and Rodney arrived, Vanessa beat the living hell out of them and tied them up in her car. Vanessa, angry at Coffee for what she heard, takes Kareem and drives off - but Watts's henchmen arrive and kidnap Vanessa and Kareem as Coffee watches helpless.\n\nHe calls Watts and tells her he's going to trade his life for Vanessa and Kareem. He drives up and demands that Vanessa and Kareem be released and he will turn himself over. When Watts threatens to shoot Kareem right there, Coffee pulls the triggers out of two grenades and begins walking over. Watts tells everyone Coffee is bluffing, and Dee shoots Coffee in the shoulder. He drops the grenades and panics, kicking them towards the drug dealers - one blows Dee to pieces, and much of the drugs are bloodied and burned. The other gives Coffee time to get Vanessa and Kareem and run away, Watts is furious about the drugs she's about to sell being dirtied, and orders Johnson to go after and kill Coffee, Kareem, and Vanessa. When he seems uneasy, she promotes Rodney over him, and Rodney tells Johnson to kill them.\n\nJohnson finds them and holds them at gunpoint. Vanessa realizes Johnson is just like Kareem - insecure and acting tough to put a front up, and convinces him not to kill them. Johnson admits he's never shot anyone and really just wanted to be a dentist, and he agrees to help them. The Canadians Watts is selling to arrive, and due to the damage to the drugs, Watts offers him 25 percent off. He accepts, but the Detroit metro police arrive leading to a giant shootout and explosions. Kareem and Vanessa escape to safety, but Coffee gets held up by Watts. During the fight, the briefcase of money gets opened, and Watts scrambles for the money as the building explodes. As Vanessa and Kareem watch in horror, Coffee emerges on fire, extremely badly burned but alive. Rodney escapes with some cocaine, Johnson is made an official informant by the police. Coffee asks Vanessa to marry him, and she jokes she'll have to wait to see how his face heals up. Watts emerges from the fire, still alive, ready to shoot Coffee, but Vanessa grabs his gun and shoots her repeatedly until she does down. Kareem agrees that it's okay for Coffee to keep seeing his mother, and they fist bump.\n\n(copied from themoviespoiler)"

    "Coffy": "In a crowded nightclub, a well-known drug pusher is enjoying an evening out with several female companions. One of his junkie henchmen approaches him and tells him that he's driving the pusher's car, and he's brought him a young woman who is willing to do anything to get some drugs. The pusher is angry until he sees the person in the car, a beautiful woman who returns with him to a shabby apartment. Just when it seems like they are going to have sex, the woman pulls a severely sawed-off shotgun out of her macrame purse and blasts the dealer's head off. The henchman, who is in the other room shooting up, is confronted by the woman, who tells him her last name is Coffin, and that her sister is LuBelle Coffin. LuBelle is now in a hospital, having shot up with tainted heroin, and her mind is permanently damaged. The enraged woman forces the man to take another hit of heroin, which kills him.\n\nThe woman is known to her friends and associates as Coffy (Pam Grier), a nurse at a city hospital. Coffy has a romance with political hopeful Howard Brunswick (Booker Bradshaw), but she is devoted to caring for her sister. She gets news of her \"hit\" from Carter (William Elliott), a policeman friend of hers. Carter is a good cop who refuses to take payoffs from local mobster Arturo Vitroni (Allan Arbus), and as a result, Vitroni sends his henchmen to knock Carter around. Coffy happens to be in the way at the time, and both of them wind up in the hospital. Coffy is little more than shaken, but Carter is beaten unconscious and seriously injured.\n\nMore angry than ever, Coffy sets out to stop the mobsters once and for all. She learns of a pusher named King George (Robert DoQui) who is supplying heroin to local dealers. George is also a well-known pimp; Coffy is vaguely familiar with George because one of his prostitutes, Priscilla (Carol Locatell), once came to Coffy's hospital after George cut her face. Coffy visits Priscilla at her home and leans on her for information about George and his business practices. Priscilla tells Coffy about Arturo Vitroni and how he is one of George's best clients. Vitroni apparently likes to treat his hookers cruelly, humiliating them and making them do degrading things for his pleasure. Priscilla balks when Coffy asks her where George keeps his stash; she is afraid that if she tells Coffy this, George will find out and kill her, so she pulls a knife on Coffy and tries to frighten her off. Instead, Coffy turns violent, shattering a wine bottle and threatening Priscilla with the jagged edge. Priscilla tells Coffy that George keeps his heroin stash in a box under his fireplace. Just then, Priscilla's tough lesbian pimp, Harriet (Dea St. Lamont), returns and fights with Coffy, who just barely escapes.\n\nWith the information she got from Priscilla, Coffy sets out to infiltrate George's business. She sets up a meeting with King George and pretends to be a Jamaican hooker named Mystique. George immediately takes her into his fold, much to the chagrin of George's 'old lady', Meg (Linda Haynes). During a party at George's pad, the jealous Meg dumps a tray of cocktails in Coffy's lap. When she goes into George's bedroom to clean up, Coffy sees her opportunity and accesses his drug stash, disposing of all his heroin and replacing it with ordinary sugar. Returning to the party, she then picks a fight with Meg and winds up fending off Meg and the rest of the girls. Coffy emerges the victor when Meg cuts herself on a series of razor blades that Coffy has hidden in her afro. Arturo Vitroni witnesses the fight, and he so taken by Coffy that he requests a session with her that very night.\n\nCoffy arrives at Vitroni's house and attempts to assassinate him, but she is stopped by Omar (Sid Haig), Arturo's bodyguard. They make the mistake of believing that King George has sent Coffy to make a hit on Arturo, so they retaliate. Keeping Coffy locked up, they lure George into a limousine and then kill him by tying a rope around him and dragging him behind the vehicle.\n\nThey are undecided about what to do with Coffy. One of Vitroni's goons recognizes Coffy from the night they roughed her up along with Carter; another of Virtoni's shady associates recognizes Coffy as Howard Brunswick's girlfriend. Believing her to be a hit woman, the gangsters summon Brunswick, unsure about whether he is associated with Coffy's attempted hit. Vitroni is suspicious when he realizes that Coffy and Howard do indeed know one another, but Coffy insists Howard had nothing to do with her attempt on Vitroni's life, blaming it entirely on King George. To her dismay, Howard betrays Coffy and tells Vitroni that for all he cares, they can kill her.\n\nOmar and some other goons take Coffy to a desolate area of the city with intentions of killing her and dumping the body. Along the way they inject her with some heroin they took from King George's stash--Coffy knows it's really just sugar. She distracts them with her feminine wiles and manages to stab Omar in the throat, mortally wounding him. Another goon chases Coffy out onto a busy freeway, where he is run down by a passing vehicle. The third goon, a crooked cop, tries to run Coffy down after chasing her under a bridge, but she shatters his windshield with a brick and he flips the car. Coffy steals his shotgun just before the car explodes, killing him.\n\nCoffy stashes her shotgun and hitches a ride with a stranger, luring him out of the car and stealing it once he's gone. She returns to her hiding place and retrieves the shotgun, then returns to Vitroni's and drives the car straight into the house, killing one goon who was standing on the porch. Inside she lets loose with her shotgun, killing everyone she sees until she has Vitroni cornered in a swimming pool. She toys with him and tells him she'll take a million dollar payoff to let him live, but after he tells her where Brunswick went, she shoots him anyway.\n\nCoffy's revenge isn't complete until she pays a visit to Howard. She slips into his beach house and surprises him, holding the shotgun on him. Howard is shocked to see Coffy alive, and even more shocked to hear that she's killed all of his shady associates. Howard manages to soothe Coffy, convincing her that he was only playing along with the crooks to buy time. But his speech is interrupted by a woman calling for him from upstairs; a semi-nude white woman walks out of one of the bedrooms. Coffy responds by gunning down Howard right there in his living room as the terrified woman screams in horror. Coffy then stumbles out into the morning light, grimy and covered with bloody scratches and bruises, but alive."

    "Cold Eyes": "A girl named Ha Yoon-joo joins a police division where the members are largely unarmed and don't wear uniforms. Led by a man named Hwang, the division avoids arresting criminals and focuses exclusively on following them around to gather information. One day a bank is robbed and only one of the seven criminals is caught on camera. In response, Hwang, Ha, and six other officers spend several weeks wandering around the city streets, tagging after people who match the criminal's physical description. When they finally find him, they put cameras outside his apartment.\n\nMeanwhile, James, the leader of the criminals, wishes to quit his line of work, but his elderly mentor responds by sending a man to kill him, whom he successfully defends against. When James's subordinates confer to discuss the next mission, they are successfully tracked by Hwang's officers, who call in a SWAT team to subdue them. James, who was standing in a separate location, finds it necessary to murder one of Hwang's officers to escape. Later, after James is given criticism from the mentor, he attacks the mentor's hide-out, murdering the mentor and his body-guards. He then acquires a fake Thai pass-port and gets ready to leave South Korea.\n\nHwang and Ha both feel sad at the death of their colleague. As a result, Hwang announces his resignation while Ha takes a leave of absence. However, while Ha is doing her laundry, she suddenly remembers using her photographic memory that she has run into James in the past. Namely, on the day of her police interview, James had fleetingly walked past her inside a subway car, carrying a grocery store brochure. Ha runs to the grocery store and waits there, managing to catch sight of James again, and urgently notifies Hwang and his officers while staying on James's tail. When James walks into a tunnel, Hwang takes over the pursuit, but James recognizes Hwang and stabs him. Luckily, though, the wound isn't fatal. Ha continues the pursuit into the subway tunnels but is also recognized by James and held hostage. When the SWAT team comes, James lets go of Ha and runs deeper into the tunnels.\n\nAs the chase goes on, James finds himself trapped between an advancing SWAT team and the mouth of the tunnel, which is being guarded by Hwang, who ran the long way around. As James decides to charge at Hwang, the latter, finding himself at the juncture of an oncoming train, stands his ground to shoot at James, risking a 50/50 chance that the train will flatten him. Fortunately, the train takes the other branch and James is hit by Hwang's revolver and killed. Encouraged by the success, Hwang withdraws his resignation, and together with Ha, goes on to execute further such missions including the pursuit of international terrorists."

    "Cold Pursuit": "Nelson \"Nels\" Coxman (Liam Neeson) lives a quiet life as a snowplow driver in the glitzy Colorado ski resort of Kehoe, where he was just awarded \"Citizen of the Year\". He serene life is disrupted when his son Kyle (Miche\u00e1l Richardson) dies from a forced heroin overdose. Kyle is kidnapped by criminal enforcers Speedo (Michael Eklund) and Limbo (Bradley Stryker), along with, Dante (Wesley MacInnes. Kyle is injected with Heroine while Dante manages to free himself and run out of the van. Nels' wife Grace (Laura Dern) has a psychotic breakdown over her son's death and leaves her husband in grief. Nel is confident that Kyle was not a drug junkie.\n\nA depressed Coxman is about to commit suicide when he learns from Dante (who was hiding in Nels storage locker) that his son was murdered by a Denver drug cartel. Nels learns that Kyle got involved with Viking's men, lost a bag of cocaine, which led to their capture and Kyle's murder. Dante says that Kyle didn't know about the cocaine and was framed by Speedo. This causes Nels to craft a custom sniper rifle and go after Speedo. He finds Speedo at a nightclub and beats him up to find that he works for Limbo (Bradley Stryker). Nels kills Speedo and throws his body into the river. Nels finds Limbo at a wedding dress shop where he works and kills him after learning that he works for Santa (Michael Adamthwaite) who flies in and out of Kehoe as the drugs supplier. Nels finds Santa driving on the road, and hits him with his snowplow. Nels beats Santa, but he doesn't reveal anything, forcing Nels to kill him as well. All 3 bodies are disposed off in the river, wrapped in chicken wire, so that fish can eat the flesh, the bodies wont fill with gas and rise to the surface.\n\nThe cartel's psychopathic drug lord, Trevor \"Viking\" Calcote (Tom Bateman), first suspects that these deaths are the work of his rival White Bull (Tom Jackson), a Ute with whom he has so far avoided conflict. Viking is increasingly frustrated with the murder of his gang members, and the loss of 10 kilos of cocaine. Viking's father had a deal with the Ute, with Ute being the distributors of the drugs and Viking's father being the supplier. Then the Ute wanted more and negotiated the control of Kehoe, which built a ski report and turned into a gold mine. Viking was secretly supplying drugs into Kehoe, breaking the deal and believes that White Bull retaliated.\n\nViking's son Ryan is being bullied at school and his Ute ex-wife Aya (Julia Jones) is fighting him for Ryan's custody. Viking keeps Ryan on a strict protein diet, with no sugars or treats. Mustang and Dexter are Viking's trusted men, who also look over Ryan. Mustang and Dexter are also in love with each other.\n\nViking has one of Bull's gangsters Baby Hawk (Kyle Nobess) murdered, not knowing it is White Bull's only son. This drives White Bull to seek vengeance, and he orders his men to kidnap Viking's young son Ryan (Nicholas Holmes) in retaliation, which starts a gang war. Avalanche is White Bull's trusted lieutenant.\n\nNels seeks advice from his brother Brock (William Forsythe), once a mob enforcer known as Wingman, and learns that Kyle was involved with Viking's cartel. Brock tells Nels that killing Viking requires a hired assassin, and he recommends a transplanted hit-man known as \"The Eskimo\" (Arnold Pinnock). The Eskimo agrees to kill Viking for Nels' US$90,000 (with 2/3rd paid to him upfront) but decides he can get another US$90,000 from Viking by informing him that Coxman has hired him for the hit.\n\nViking does not appreciate the Eskimo's \"lack of professional ethics\" and subsequently kills him. He thinks the Eskimo meant Brock Coxman, and he takes Brock in his car. Since Brock is dying of Colorectal cancer, he claims responsibility for the hits to protect his brother and says that he flushed the 10 Kilos of cocaine down the toilet. Viking realizes that White Bull did not murder his men at all. Kenoe officers Kimberly Dash and Gip put together all the murders in Kehoe and Kimberly suspects that their little town is in the middle of a gang war. She meets Nels and says that she doesn't believe Kyle was a drug addict, but Nels refuses to share anything with her.\n\nViking tries in vain to stop the gang war by using one of his own men (Dexter (Benjamin Hollingsworth)) as a scapegoat and sending White Bull the man's head. Viking claims that Dexter is the culprit and wants the old deal with White Bill reinstated. This is insufficient to placate White Bull, who shoots the messenger.\n\nMeanwhile, Nels kidnaps Ryan from his prep school before White Bull's men can do so, in order to draw Viking into an ambush. White Bull's men identify the van to be from Kehoe and check into a town hotel. Nels treats the boy well and protects him from the violence to come. Ryan makes him read a story to him, before going to bed. Nels' identity is revealed to Viking by the prep school's janitor. Though promised US$10,000 for the tip, he too is killed after his disclosure.\n\nNels calls Viking and tells him to come to his house alone, and when Viking says it will take him 3 hours, Nels takes Ryan with him to work. While Viking was lying, as he already knew Nels' address and was minutes away, he finds the house empty; his men toss the place to find clues about the kidnapper. While Nels teaches Ryan how to drive the snow equipment, Viking's men find out where Nels works and heads out. Mustang (Domenick Lombardozzi), silently grieving over Dexter's senseless death, tips off the Ute, who are also in town.\n\nBoth parties arrive at the company site, and most of them are killed in the ensuing shootout. Viking, attempting to drive away, is trapped when Nels uses heavy machinery to impale Viking's car with a Shorn tree trunk, allowing White Bull to shoot Viking in the chest. He dies when found by Kehoe patrol officers Kimberly Dash (Emmy Rossum) and Gip (John Doman). Officer Dash spots Ryan driving in an industrial snow blower with Nels in the direction of Kehoe, but Dash chooses not to follow. As Nels leaves the property in his snowplow to continue his work, White Bull jumps into the cab; after initially holding Nels at gunpoint, the two men drive away together with both being satisfied for having avenged their respective children's death. The scene ends after Avalanche (Mitchell Saddleback) accidentally flies into the snowplow, being minced to death and shredded to bits."

    "Collateral Damage": "A bomb is detonated in the plaza of the Colombian Consulate building in Los Angeles, killing 9 people including a caravan of Colombian officials and American intelligence agents. Among the civilians killed are the wife and son of LAFD firefighter, Gordy Brewer (Arnold Schwarzenegger), who was injured in the explosion as he arrived to pick up his family. Soon afterward, a tape is sent to the U.S. State Department, in which a masked man calling himself \"El Lobo\" (The Wolf) claims responsibility for the bombing, explaining it was in retaliation for America's oppression of Colombia.\n\nThe FBI believes El Lobo is a Colombian terrorist named Claudio Perrini (Cliff Curtis). CIA Special Agent Peter Brandt (Elias Koteas), the Colombia Station Chief, is harshly reprimanded for the incident by a Senate Oversight Committee, who promptly terminate all CIA operations in Colombia. Brandt angrily returns to Momp\u00f3s and meets with his paramilitary allies to plan a major offensive to take down Claudio and his guerrilla forces.\n\nFrustrated at the political red tape regarding the investigation, Brewer also travels to Momp\u00f3s to personally hunt down Claudio but is quickly arrested for illegally entering the country. The guerrillas stage a prison break to free their fellow members as well as try and abduct Brewer to demand a large ransom for him. Brandt's unit is alerted to Brewer's presence in Colombia but arrive too late to prevent the prison break. Brewer escapes the prison, avoids being captured, and secures a guerrilla zone pass from Canadian mechanic Sean Armstrong (John Turturro) who reveals information into setting him up with drug runner, Felix Ramirez (John Leguizamo), the manager of the cocaine distribution facility that finances the guerrillas.\n\nPretending to be a mechanic hired to fix a generator, Brewer rigs several improvised explosives and destroys the facility. Felix is blamed for the destruction of the drug plant and is executed in front of a hiding Gordy's eyes. Brewer then infiltrates Claudio's headquarters and plants a bomb to kill him but is captured when he tries to prevent a woman, later revealed to be Claudio's wife Selena (Francesca Neri), from being caught in the blast radius. At Claudio's home compound, Selena, who also lost a child in a bombing, empathizes with Brewer's motives and admits that Claudio is planning another bombing in Washington, D.C.\n\nMeanwhile, Brandt's unit locates Claudio's compound and launches an attack. During the ensuing shootout, Selena helps free Brewer and, along with Brandt, travels back to the State Department in Washington, D.C. to help the search effort for Claudio. Selena identifies Union Station as the target, and the FBI go to investigate. On the pretense of using the lavatory, she excuses herself from the command room and becomes irritated when her adopted son Mauro refuses to come with her. Brewer recognizes Selena make the same gesture as the masked man claiming to be El Lobo made in the tape and realizes that she was \"The Wolf\" all along.\n\nFurthermore, Brewer surmises the real target is the State Department. Brewer quickly throws Mauro's toy dinosaur, with the bomb inside of it, out the window moments before it explodes. Brandt is shot and killed in an elevator trying to stop Selena from fleeing the building.\n\nBrewer chases Selena to the basement of the building where she and Claudio ride off through the underground tunnels on a motorcycle. Brewer finds the tunnel control console and shuts the gates, preventing their escape.

    "Collide": "In the opening scene, Casey (Nicholas Hoult) is being chased down a freeway and crashing. The camera pans to his wrecked car where he narrates, saying that people do all sorts of crazy things, but if they're doing it for love, maybe it's not so crazy after all.\n\nA few days earlier, Casey meets Juliette (Felicity Jones) and they fall in love. They bond when they both dare each other to see who can lay in the snow in their undergarments the longest, during which Casey finds out that Juliette is sick and is going to be needing an emergency surgery. Not wanting for her to pay for the surgery, Casey agrees to help his old boss, Geran (Ben Kingsley), a mid-level wannabe gangster, rob an 18-wheeler that belongs to Hagen Kahl (Anthony Hopkins), who is known as a respectable businessman, but is secretly a drug lord.\n\nIn the past, Geran helped Kahl become the powerful man he currently is, but after Geran wanted to be equal partners with Kahl and was turned down, Geran decides to rob him. Casey and his friend, Matthias, plan a faked car accident involving a motorcycle and a car. The driver of the 18-wheeler pulls over and looks at Matthias in the car (who's pretending to be injured and unconscious), while Casey hides nearby in the bushes.\n\nThe driver heads back to the truck and grabs a first aid kit. He walks halfway to Matthias, stops and places the first aid kit on the ground. He opens the first aid kit and pulls out a hidden machine gun and begins shooting at Matthias. Matthias is able to dodge the bullets from inside the car, giving Casey time to sneak up on the driver and knock him out. Having been told that there is a camera in the truck, Casey takes the driver's hat and puts it on, masking his face from the camera. Casey takes off, while Matthias follows behind in another vehicle. Casey and Matthias split off in separate directions.\n\nThe men watching Kahl's cameras, notice that Casey isn't looking at the camera and they deduce that the truck has been hijacked. A short while later, Casey's truck is broadsided by another large truck and flips onto its side. Casey passes out. He wakes up in a large warehouse. There, Kahl questions Casey, wondering who hired him and who he's working for. Casey doesn't give in, which leads Kahl to threaten Casey with hurting Juliette, saying he did some research on him and knows about his relationship with her. As Kahl leaves, Casey is about to be tortured, but he is able to break out and hops into an empty car and escapes from the warehouse.\n\nCasey tries to call Juliette to warn her, but gets interrupted and gets into a prolonged car chase scene with one of Kahl's men. Casey crashes into a car, and Kahl's man gets out of his car with a machine gun and begins shooting at Casey. All of a sudden, a speeding police car shows up, smashes into Kahl's henchman's car (launching it into the air in dramatic fashion), which proceeds to also smash into the car Casey is driving.\n\nCasey notices some money sticking out of one of the back passenger doors. He looks into the door and notices blocks of money have been hidden inside the doors of the car (which also explains another reason why Kahl and his men are after him). Casey puts a good amount of the money in a sack and takes off as Kahl's main henchman shows up. An extended foot chase erupts through a bar, a building, a house and across a rooftop. Casey gets cornered in the house and has a brief fight with the henchman before he knocks him out for a few moments, giving Casey a chance to escape.\n\nCasey makes it to the street where he encounters a police car heading his way. To avoid being detected, he poses as a homeless man, sitting on the street. The police car makes its way to him, and once it has passed by, Casey takes off in the other direction. Kahl's henchman spots Casey again, leading to another foot chase. This time, Casey makes it to another car, steals it and takes off, leaving the henchman behind. Casey calls Matthias and tells him to get Juliette out of the hospital by taking her out for coffee or to see a movie. Anything that will get her out of the hospital and will keep her away from Kahl's clutches.\n\nAt the hospital, Juliette passes by two of Kahl's men, who then turn around and start following her. Back where Casey stole his latest car, the driver of that car starts shouting at police saying that his car has been stolen, attracting the attention of Kahl's henchman, who asks the driver about the car.\n\nCasey gets a call from Kahl, who subtly tells Casey that he knows Juliette's address, urging Casey, even more, to get to her before Kahl does. Casey calls Geran and tells him that everything went really wrong. Geran asks Casey if he sold him out, but Casey tells Geran that he didn't. Casey tells Geran that he can have the money that he took from Kahl's car (estimated to be around $5 million) and all he needs is $200,000 and for Geran to protect Juliette, which Geran agrees to do. Casey is then chased by more of Kahl's men on the freeway, leading to another prolonged car chase scene. Casey ends up eluding Kahl's men but ends up wrecking his car and imagines Juliette in the car with him as it's flipping over numerous times. This is revealed to be the scene from the beginning of the film.\n\nCasey wakes up and notices a small mini-suitcase inside the car, which he empties and places the money inside. Casey steals another car. As he's driving, he calls Matthias and asks him if he's with Juliette. Matthias says no, and that somebody must've got to her first since he went to her place and no one was there. Casey notices that the car he stole is running out of gas, so he stops at a station and notices that it only takes cards, not cash.\n\nCasey goes inside and tries to pay with a large bill, but because of security reasons, they won't take large bills. Casey pleads with the owner to let him pay with it, to which the owner relents and lets Casey pay with it. Casey notices Kahl, and his men pull up to the station. Casey hides the case under a shelf of chips, but one of Kahl's men finds it anyway. A friend of the gas station owner sees Kahl's men with guns, so he grabs his shotgun and heads inside. He comes into the gas station and points his gun at Kahl's men. Kahl, himself, comes to the store and talks to the man. Kahl asks the man what his name is. The man replies that his name is Wolfgang. Kahl asks if it's like Mozart. Kahl says that Wolfgang will be seeing Mozart soon when he pulls out his gun and shoots him.\n\nCasey begins quietly laughing at Kahl. Kahl says most men cry or pray when they're about to die, but that laughing is original. Casey then tells Kahl that he is still in control because he still has Kahl's truck. It is then revealed that Casey switched trucks and that the truck that crashed earlier was a decoy. Wolfgang wakes up and shoots one of Kahl's men and takes cover behind a counter, giving Casey time to steal Kahl's car and escape.\n\nCasey calls Geran and asks about Juliette. Geran tells Casey that someone got to Juliette's place before they did and that she's dead. He's lying to get a rise out of Casey. Geran tells Casey that his men have her and they're on their way back. Casey drives to Geran's horse track and goes with him to a barn to see Juliette. Inside the barn, Geran brings out a woman, revealing her to be another woman, not Juliette. Geran got the apartment number mixed up. Casey threatens Geran, but Geran rebukes him with a gun. While this is going on, a man at the track texts Kahl.\n\nThis same man goes into the barn, shoots Geran and knocks out Casey. He ties up Casey, but Casey escapes and kills the man with a large hook. Casey takes the money, gets into Geran's car and dozes off for a few minutes where he dreams that Juliette is in the car with him. Casey wakes up when his phone rings. It's Kahl, who tells Casey that he has something he wants. Casey arranges for a trade-off: Juliette for the money. Back in the barn, Geran wakes up, still alive.\n\nCasey makes it to the location of the trade-off: a local bar, and reunites with Juliette. Casey shows Kahl the money. After having seen the money, Kahl tells Juliette that she can go, but for Casey to stay, so that they can \"sort some matters out.\" Geran bursts into the bar and holds a gun on Kahl. Geran tracked the car via GPS, which is how he found out the location of the trade off.\n\nGeran sits down at a table across from Kahl. Geran orders Casey to get him a drink. The police show up outside, to which Casey admits to having called them. The police launch a smoke grenade into the bar, leading to Geran exchanging fire with the police. Casey and Juliette escape out the back of the bar with the money, while Kahl escapes out the back of the bar into a waiting car. Geran stays to exchange gunfire with the police, who promptly kill him.\n\nBeing pursued by Kahl's main henchman, Casey and Juliette escape to a train station. Casey tells Juliette to get on a train with the money as he gives himself up to be arrested and Kahl's henchman is gunned down by the police. Casey is interrogated by the police and gives them the location of Kahl's truck to the police, so that Kahl can be exposed as a drug lord (since his name is on the truck itself) and can be arrested, which is what happens.\n\nSome time later, Casey watches as Juliette goes in for her surgery at the hospital."

They call the perpetrator \"The Tag Killer\" due to the markings the killer leaves on the chest. It is the Cataleya flower. CIA Agent Richard (Callum Blue) travels to New Orleans to a heavily guarded villa. It is the home of Don Luis, who was brought to US by CIA in exchange for Info. Richard shows him the hit from the jail cells, but Luis denies he had anything to do with it.

Cataleya shoots him in the chest, and he falls into the opened pool. The blood flows and his sharks eat him alive in seconds.\n\nRoss is looking at the Tag Killer calling card when the mailman gives him a vital clue; it is the Cataleya flower that only grows in Columbia. Ross tries to tie it to open cases in Columbia but is denied access due to CIA jurisdiction. Ross calls Richard and ask for clearance but Richard dodges the issue. He puts pressure on Luis to resolve the issue. Macro resorts to door-to-door search in Chicago to find Cataleya. Danny & Cataleya have sex. He takes a picture of her with his iPhone. Danny tries to get close to Cataleya, but she is afraid that he will get hurt.\n\nCataleya meets with Emilio. He is livid, having seen the paper. Cataleya has not stopped with her calling card. People are looking for them, showing that eight people were gunned down in a bar, one being a friend of Emilio. \"You're retired.\" Emilio tells her. Cataleya refuses to give up. Danny shows Cataleya photo to a friend, who calls his sister-in-law, who is a cop to check if Cataleya or \"Jennifer\" is legit. When Danny is distracted, he sends the photo to the cop. Ross is at his computer when it is pinged with Cataleya's photo. He traces the signal to the other police station. Ross compares the photo to the security footage at the jail and its a match. Cataleya is the woman who he is looking for.\n\nThat evening Danny mentions the photo to Cataleya & she immediately leaves the apartment. SWAT team are already outside. Cataleya manages to escape via a planned escape route. She heads to Emilio & finds him tortured & dead. She breaks down.

Cataleya attacks Don's home. She kills all their men & faces Marco & kills him in hand-to-hand combat. Luis tries to escape in a van when Cataleya calls him from Marco's phone. She had put Pepe's dogs in the van & now tells them \"EAT\". The trained dogs proceed to eat Don Luis.\n\nDanny was taken into custody by Ross and the FBI. Danny knows little and tells them so. Ross says while he is not under arrest, he still has questions to answer. Danny asks for coffee and Ross goes to get it. Danny gets a call from Cataleya. She tells him she's OK and they have 40 seconds before they trace the call, so that's enough time to ask three questions. He asks for her real name, and she tells him it's Cataleya. Danny asks if his little bird will return one day (meaning her). Cataleya tells him that maybe one day she can.\n\nDanny has only seconds now. \"I love you.\" Danny says which makes Cataleya tear up. Ross orders him to give over the phone but Cataleya hangs up before he can get anything from her. Ross stares at the phone and tells Danny he's free to go. Cataleya puts her sunglasses on and gets on a bus for a destination unknown."
