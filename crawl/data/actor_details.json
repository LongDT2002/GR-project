        "biography": "Marion Mitchell Morrison (born Marion Robert Morrison; May 26, 1907 \u2013 June 11, 1979), known professionally as John Wayne and nicknamed Duke, was an American actor and filmmaker. An Academy Award-winner for True Grit (1969), Wayne was among the top box office draws for three decades.\n\nBorn in Winterset, Iowa, Wayne grew up in Southern California. He was president of Glendale High class of 1925. He found work at local film studios when he lost his football scholarship to the University of Southern California as a result of a bodysurfing accident. Initially working for the Fox Film Corporation, he appeared mostly in small bit parts. His first leading role came in Raoul Walsh's The Big Trail (1930), which led to leading roles in numerous B movies throughout the 1930s, many of them in the Western genre.\n\nWayne's career took off in 1939, with John Ford's Stagecoach making him an instant star. He went on to star in 142 pictures. Biographer Ronald Davis said, \"John Wayne personified for millions the nation's frontier heritage. Eighty-three of his movies were Westerns, and in them, he played cowboys, cavalrymen, and unconquerable loners extracted from the Republic's central creation myth.\"\n\nWayne's other well-known Western roles include a cattleman driving his herd north on the Chisholm Trail in Red River (1948), a Civil War veteran whose young niece is abducted by a tribe of Comanches in The Searchers (1956), and a troubled rancher competing with a lawyer for a woman's hand in marriage in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962). He is also remembered for his roles in The Quiet Man (1952), Rio Bravo (1959), and The Longest Day (1962). In his final screen performance, he starred as an aging gunfighter battling cancer in The Shootist (1976). He appeared with many important Hollywood stars of his era, and his last public appearance was at the Academy Awards ceremony on April 9, 1979."

        "biography": "Aur\u00e9lien Recoing (born 5 May 1958) is a French actor and stage director.\n\nAur\u00e9lien Recoing is the son of Alain Recoing (puppeteer), and the brother of \u00c9loi Recoing (director and translator), Blaise Recoing (actor and musician), and David Recoing (pianist, composer).\n\nBorn in Paris on May 5, 1958, Aur\u00e9lien Recoing began training to be an actor in 1974 at Cours Florent, and studied at Quartier d'Ivry. In 1977, the actor-in-training, who spoke fluent English and a little Russian, joined the Conservatoire national sup\u00e9rieur d'art dramatique in Paris, where he studied under Jean-Pierre Miquel and Antoine Vitez. He has appeared in more than 30 plays and has directed stage performances of works by Thomas Bernhard, Fernando Pessoa and Paul Claudel. He was awarded the Prix G\u00e9rard Philipe in 1989.\n\nIn 1980, Aur\u00e9lien Recoing took his first steps into the world of cinema, in Exploits of a Young Don Juan. Finding art-house cinema appealing to him, he worked with Philippe Garrel on Emergency Kisses (Les baisers de secours), and with Laurence Ferreira Barbosa on Modern Life. The actor rose to fame in 2001 thanks to Laurent Cantet's Time Out (L'Emploi du Temps), in which he plays a man who invents a false life to avoid having to tell his friends and family that he has been fired from his job. As he became more and more in demand, he alternated between blockbusters such as Ruby & Quentin and That Woman and art-house films like L'Ennemi naturel and Orlando Vargas. Lending his talents to a number of unusual projects, in 2006 he portrayed a gamblers in 13 Tzameti, G\u00e9la Babluani's black-and-white thriller, and also appeared in Forgive Me (Pardonnez-moi), Ma\u00efwenn's home-movie style drama. In the same year, the physically imposing actor found himself transported back to 1914 France in Fragments of Antonin, and then to 1959 Kabylia in Florent Emilio Siri's Intimate Enemies. In 2008, he starred in Franck Llopis' Paris Nord-Sud and in La Saison des Orphelins. The following year, he was cast in Gilles B\u00e9hat's crime thriller Diamant 13 with G\u00e9rard Depardieu, and in Denis Dercourt's Tomorrow at Dawn (Demain d\u00e8s l'aube).\n\nHe has made appearances in The Horde, directed by Yannick Dahan and Benjamin Rocher, Xavier de Choudens' Joseph and the Girl with Jacques Dutronc, and L\u00e9on Desclozeaux's Cargo, the Lost Men in 2010. He appeared in Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Schoendoerffer's Switch, as well as in Olias Barco's Kill Me Please, which won the Marc'Aurelio d'Oro for best film at Rome Film Festival in 2010. He also appeared in Abdellatif Kechiche's Blue is the Warmest Colour, which took the Palme d'Or at Cannes. In 2020 he appeared in Adults in the room. An upcoming appearance is in Grand Ciel an Arte Film.\n\nHe made his first short film as a director The Rifleman (Un Bon Tireur) which won an Award Winner for Best Drama in 2021. He is developing his first feature film Naked Hands (\u00c0 Mains Nues) with Sensito Films Productions.\n\nSource: Article \"Aur\u00e9lien Recoing\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0."

        "biography": " From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nLoni Kaye Anderson (born August 5, 1945) is an American actress who played the role of Jennifer Marlowe on the television sitcom WKRP in Cincinnati.\n\nAnderson was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, August 5, 1945, the daughter of Maxine Hazel (n\u00e9e Kallin), a model, and Klaydon Carl \"Andy\" Anderson, an environmental chemist and grew up in suburban Roseville.\n\n As a senior at Alexander Ramsey Senior High School in Roseville in 1963, she was voted Valentine Queen of Valentine's Day Winter Formal. She attended the University of Minnesota. As she says in her autobiography, My Life in High Heels, her father was originally going to name her \"Leiloni,\" but then realized to his horror that when she got to her teen years it was liable to be twisted into \"Lay Loni.\" So it was changed to just plain \"Loni.\"\n\n Anderson's most famous acting role came as receptionist Jennifer Marlowe on WKRP in Cincinnati. Her pinup photo in a bikini became one of the best-selling wall posters of the 1970s. She and husband Burt Reynolds made one film together, the 1983 stock-car racing comedy Stroker Ace, a huge box-office failure.  Shortly after her divorce from Reynolds, she appeared as a regular in the final season (1993\u20131994) on the NBC sitcom Nurses. Anderson portrayed actress Jayne Mansfield in a made-for-TV biopic with Arnold Schwarzenegger as her husband, Mickey Hargitay. She teamed with Lynda Carter in a 1984 television series, Partners in Crime.  Anderson made a series of cameo appearances on television shows in the late 1990s and early 2000s, such as the Spellmans' \"witch-trash\" cousin on Sabrina, the Teenage Witch and Vallery Irons' mother on V.I.P.  Anderson has been married four times; her first three marriages were to: Bruce Hasselberg (1964\u20131966), Ross Bickell (1973\u20131981), and actor (and one-time co-star) Burt Reynolds (1988\u20131993). On May 17, 2008, Anderson married musician Bob Flick, one of the founding members of the folk band The Brothers Four. The couple had met at a movie premiere in Anderson's native Minneapolis a few years after Flick's group hit No. 2 on the pop charts with \"Greenfields\" in 1960. The ceremony was attended by friends and family, including son Quinton Reynolds.  She has two children: a daughter, Deidra Hoffman (from her first marriage), who is a school administrator in California; and a son, Quinton Anderson Reynolds (born August 31, 1988), whom she and Burt Reynolds adopted. Her autobiography, My Life in High Heels, was published in 1997. Anderson is currently a practicing Lutheran.

He initially pondered a law career, but acting won out and he established himself as a musical stage performer.\n\nEducated in dramatics at the University of Pittsburgh, where he became a brother of Sigma Chi, Toomey began as a stock actor and eventually made it to Broadway. Toomey was a singer on stage until throat problems (acute laryngitis) while touring in Europe stopped that aspect of his career. In 1929, Toomey first began appearing in films.

He is the recipient of various accolades, including a Screen Actors Guild Award, a Critics' Choice Movie Award, and nominations for two Academy Awards, four British Academy Film Awards and three Golden Globe Awards.\n\nBorn in Heidelberg and raised in Killarney, Fassbender made his feature film debut as a Spartan warrior in the fantasy war epic 300 (2006). His earlier roles included various stage productions, as well as starring roles on television such as in the HBO miniseries Band of Brothers (2001) and the Sky One fantasy drama Hex (2004\u201305). He first came to prominence for his role as IRA volunteer Bobby Sands in Hunger (2008), for which he won a British Independent Film Award. Subsequent roles include the independent film Fish Tank (2009), as a Royal Marines lieutenant in Inglourious Basterds (2009), as Edward Rochester in the 2011 film adaptation of Jane Eyre, as Carl Jung in A Dangerous Method (2011), as the sentient android, David 8, in Ridley Scott's Prometheus (2012) and its sequel, Alien: Covenant (2017), and in the musical comedy drama Frank (2014) as an eccentric musician loosely inspired by Frank Sidebottom.\n\nThe actor\u2019s former girlfriend, Sunawin \u201cLeasi\u201d Andrews, says she was the victim of domestic abuse at the hands of Fassbender in 2009. Andrews filed a restraining order in March 2010, requesting Fassbender stay at least 100 yards away from her and her two children. She also sought $24,000 to pay for medical bills that were the result of the injuries she says she suffered after Fassbender abused her on multiple occasions.\n\nOne instance of abuse allegedly occurred after Fassbender and Andrews were having dinner with friends at a restaurant. The court filings say Fassbender became angry with Andrews after one of her ex-boyfriends came over to their table to say hello. The actor\u2019s anger carried over to the car ride home.\n\n\u201cI went to the hospital and had a twisted left ankle, blown out left knee cap and a bursted ovarian cyst,\u201d Andrews\u2019 filing reads. \u201cLots of internal bleeding.\u201d\n\nA second instance of abuse reportedly occurred at a July 2009 film festival. Fassbender had been partying late and came back to his hotel room with a friend and the two tried to get into bed with Andrews. She says she ended up checking into another room so she could avoid the two men. The next morning Andrews found Fassbender \u201csleeping in urine\u201d and when she tried to wake him up, he allegedly threw her over a chair and broke her nose."

        "biography": "Kunchacko Boban is an Indian film actor and producer who appears in Malayalam films.\n\nHe is the grandson of producer Kunchacko, who established the film production studio Udaya Pictures.\n\nKunchacko Boban made his acting debut in Fazil's Aniyathipraavu  (1997) which turned out to be a blockbuster and made him into an  overnight sensation. He became a popular lead star in the late-1990s  with successful films such as Mayilpeelikkavu (1998), Nakshatratharattu (1998), and Niram (1999). He continued his success with Dhosth (2001), Swapnakoodu (2003), and Kasthooriman (2003). After a couple of commercial failures, his career took a set back in the mid-2000s. He made a comeback with Gulumaal (2009) which was well received. Later, he went on to act in successful films such as Elsamma Enna Aankutty (2010), Traffic (2011), Seniors (2011), Ordinary (2012), Romans (2013), Pullipulikalum Aattinkuttiyum (2013), How Old Are You? (2014), and Vettah (2016). Kunchacko Boban was awarded the Special Jury Award for his performance in Ee Snehatheerathu at the 2004 Kerala State Film Awards.\n\nKunchacko Boban, son of actor, director Boban Kunchacko and grand son  of legendary Kunchacko, was introduced into Malayalam film industry by  versatile director Fazil. His debut movie Aniathipravu (1997), co-starring Shalini, and directed by Fazil [9]  was a block buster. Kunchacko Boban's performance as Sudhi, the lead  character got him good reception across young audience and the family  crowd. Kunchacko Boban- Shalini pair was considered as a lucky pair in  late nineties. Following the success of Aniathipravu, Kunchacko Boban was cast in movies like Nakshathrathaarattu, Mayilpeelikkavu  and Niram (1999). \"Niram\" was one of the biggest grossers of 1999.  Songs of \"Niram\" are still very popular. His performance in hit movies  \"Kasthuriman\" and \"Swapnakoodu\" was also appreciated by critics.\n\nHe played a cameo in Fazil's Harikrishnans, which marked the reunion of Mohanlal and Mammootty after 9 years. Then came a streak of Chandamama, an average film at the box office, and he went on to do Ingane Oru Nilapakshi, Prem Poojari, Sahayathrikakku Snehapoorvam etc.\n\nAfter Niram, Dosth and Narendran Makan Jayakanthan Vaka, his next films included Kasthooriman, and Swapnakkoodu. The movie Ee Snehatheerathu earned him a Special Jury Award at the 2004 Kerala State Film Awards.\n\nKunchacko was born in Alappuzha, Kerala. He is the grandson of film producer Kunchacko of the erstwhile Udaya Studios,  the first film studio in Kerala. His father Boban Kunchacko was also an  actor and producer who acted in a few films produced by Udaya and his  mother Molly is a housewife. He has two younger sisters, Anu and Mini. Boban Kunchacko later ventured into direction with the films Palattu Kunhikkannan, Sanchari and Aazhi. Kunchacko Boban is also the grandnephew of Navodaya Appachan of the Navodaya Studios.\n\nKunchako Boban married Priya Ann Samuel on 2 April 2005 at Little Flower Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, Ernakulam"

He was well known for his roles in Flesh + Blood, Blind Fury, Blade Runner, The Hitcher, Nighthawks, Sin City, Ladyhawke, The Blood of Heroes and Batman Begins.\n\nHauer was born in Breukelen, Netherlands, to drama teachers Arend and Teunke, and grew up in Amsterdam. Since his parents were very occupied with their careers, he and his three sisters (one older, two younger) were raised mostly by nannies. At the age of 15, Hauer ran off to sea and spent a year scrubbing decks aboard a freighter. Returning home, he worked as an electrician and a carpenter for three years while attending acting classes at night school. He went on to join an experimental troupe, with which he remained for five years before he was cast in the lead role in the very successful 1969 television series Floris, a Dutch Ivanhoe-like medieval action drama. The role made him famous in his native country.\n\nHauer's career changed course when director Paul Verhoeven cast him as the lead in Turkish Delight (1973) (based on the Jan Wolkers book of the same name). The movie found box-office favour abroad as well as at home, and within two years, its star was invited to make his English-language debut in the British film The Wilby Conspiracy (1975). Set in South Africa and starring Michael Caine and Sidney Poitier, the film was an action melodrama with a focus on apartheid. Hauer's supporting role, however, was barely noticed in Hollywood, and he returned to Dutch films for several years. Hauer made his American debut in the Sylvester Stallone vehicle Nighthawks (1981), cast as a psychopathic and cold-blooded terrorist named \"Wolfgar\" (after a character in the Old English poem Beowulf). The following year, he appeared in arguably his most famous and acclaimed role as the eccentric, violent, yet sympathetic replicant Roy Batty in Ridley Scott's 1982 sci-fi thriller, Blade Runner.\n\nHauer was a dedicated environmentalist. He fought for the release of Greenpeace's co-founder, Paul Watson, who was convicted in 1994 for sinking a Norwegian whaling vessel. Hauer has also established an AIDS awareness foundation called the Rutger Hauer Starfish Foundation. He married his second wife, Ineke, in 1985 (they had been together since 1968); and he has one child, actress Aysha Hauer, who was born in 1966 and who made him a grandfather in 1988. In April 2007, he published his autobiography All Those Moments: Stories of Heroes, Villains, Replicants, and Blade Runners (co-written with Patrick Quinlan) where he discussed many of his movie roles. Proceeds of the book go to Hauer's Starfish Foundation."

Before his acting career, Hale worked in the Diplomatic Corps. Hale is most well known as Dagwood Bumstead's boss, Julius Caesar Dithers, in the Blondie film series in the 1940s. He is also notable for playing Inspector Fernack in various The Saint films by RKO Pictures.\n\nIn 1950 he made two appearances in The Cisco Kid as Barry Owens. He also appeared in two different episodes of Adventures of Superman: \"The Evil Three\", in which he played a murderous \"Southern Colonel\"-type character, and \"Panic in the Sky\", one of the most famous episodes, in which he played the lead astronomer at the Metropolis Observatory, actually a California observatory.\n\nAmong the relatively few television programs on which Hale appeared are the religion anthology series Crossroads, The Loretta Young Show, Brave Eagle, Schlitz Playhouse, The Joey Bishop Show, and Walt Disney Presents: \"A Tribute to Joel Chandler Harris\".\n\nHale committed suicide on February 28, 1966. He was found dead that evening in his room at the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California. Hale had taken his own life with a .38 caliber pistol, which was found near his body. He was 74. Hale was interred at Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery in North Hollywood, California. Sadly, Hale's grave went unmarked for more than four decades, until a proper headstone was erected by donations from the \"Dearly Departed\" fan-based group in 2013; he is now honored with the inscription, \"We Remembered You\"."

In January of 2012, she announced at a press conference for the drama series, Take Care of Us, Captain that she will be going by her new stage name Clara. The reason for such a choice was because Clara felt that her birth name Sung Min was too \"male-sounding\" and that her English name had always been Clara.\n\nIn May 2013, Clara became an overnight sensation online after throwing a ceremonial first pitch in a professional baseball game dressed in form-fitting leggings. She has since been hailed as an up-and-coming star. Afterward, she again played supporting roles in the television series Goddess of Marriage (2013) and Emergency Couple (2014), followed by a leading role in the romance comedy film Casa Amor: Exclusive for Ladies (2015).\n\nClara is the daughter of singer Lee Seung Kyu, a former member of the bilingual band, Koreana.

Terry first studied dramatics at Dickson-Kenwin academy, a school affiliated with London's Royal Academy. Later she moved to New York, where she continued her studies and appeared in a number of plays. While appearing on Broadway in The Little Racketeer, she was spotted by an alert film scout and given a test which led to a contract with Warner Bros.\n\nShe played in 1930s for Warner Bros. She appeared with John Wayne in the Western films Haunted Gold (1932); Neath the Arizona Skies and The Lawless Frontier (1934). She appeared with Bette Davis, Louis Calhern and Spencer Tracy in 20,000 Years in Sing Sing (1932). She appeared with Cary Grant and Sylvia Sidney in Marion Gering's film Madame Butterfly (1932). In 1933 she left Hollywood briefly for the New York stage.  She married Major Laurence E. Clark, a wealthy Toronto socialite on August 16, 1928. She divorced him February 16, 1934. In 1937, she married William Magee of San Francisco, and retired from show business. After his death, Terry wanted to return to show business, but couldn't find a job.\n\nIn 1947, she said in a newspaper-interview: \"I'm going back into show business and I need an act, I can't sing, I can't dance and I can't play the piano. I should be terrific in night clubs\". She worked as a press agent for 15 years.\n\nIn January 1957, her body was discovered in the third floor apartment, which was both her home and office. A friend and neighbour, Jerry Keating, went to the apartment when he failed to reach her on the telephone. The door was locked, and Terry did not answer the bell. Keating called the police; they broke in and found Terry's body on the bedroom floor, her back leaning against the bed. Five capsules, their contents gone, were on the floor beside her.\n\nFriends told the police that she returned from a trip to Mexico a few days before her death and that she was ill when she came home. It was later discovered that she died broke; she left only a scanty wardrobe. She was buried in Potter's Field in New York City."

Isabelle's natural charm and beauty propelled her into the world of acting and modeling at the tender age of 17. Before long, she was hired for a series of commercials and she guest starred on several TV Shows. Isabelle's acting career began with a bang when she was handpicked from a crowd of over 500 teenagers to roller-blade in a McDonald's commercial. When Isabelle was 19, a talent scout selected her for a three-month modeling stint in Japan and later on in Spain. Although most of the assignments were print work, Isabelle spent one memorable week riding motorcycles for Kawasaki near Mount Fuji in Japan. Isabelle has always been a girl on the go. She loves yoga, soccer, swimming, rock climbing, skating, snorkeling, and dancing. She developed her team spirit through gymnastics and volleyball games. When Isabelle was in her early 20s, her parents divorced. A few years later, while she was completing a university degree, her estranged father developed cancer. Isabelle dedicated herself to nursing her ailing father. Education has always been a priority in her agenda. After a brief foray in science with a view to pursue veterinary studies, Isabelle took some courses in scriptwriting at Quebec University. Then she decided to pursue this passion and completed her BA in Communications Studies at Concordia University in Montreal. Isabelle further developed her interest in film by working as an assistant to her mentor Father Marc Gervais, a film analysis teacher, author and judge at the Cannes Film Festival. Next, she attended, The International Film and Video workshops in Rockport, Maine, USA. Three weeks after her arrival, Isabelle was offered an assistant teaching position. Shortly thereafter, she went to Los Angeles to study script analysis and acting with Judith Weston. In 2002, she acted and danced in \"The Best of Billy Joel\" music video, which appeared in Canada and the USA. She has been attending Warren Robertson theater workshops since 2002. In addition to acting, Isabelle is also interested in other facets of the entertainment industry. She has worked in casting for children's television shows (Caillou for PBS). And Isabelle has written, directed and produced documentaries, corporate videos, short films and a music video \"Red light\". She also is an assistant and location manager for photographers, TV Shows and films. In early 2007, Isabelle wrote, produced and had the lead role in The Valley - a short film based on a true story."

        "biography": "George Eastman (born Luigi Montefiori; August 16, 1942) is an Italian B-movie actor and screenwriter.\n\nEastman was born in Genoa, Italy. He took his Americanized alias \"George Eastman\" when he was cast as a \"heavy\" in many spaghetti westerns made in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1972 he performed the villain in the movie The Call of the Wild together with Charlton Heston (directed by Ken Annakin). Eastman later became a regular performer in many movies directed by Joe D'Amato, for whom he also became a screenwriter. He was a very familiar face in Italian B-cinema in the early 1980s, being generally cast as the villain, thanks to his height (he is 6'9\" tall) and his dark and menacing looks and exaggerated acting style. His most famous movie is the gory horror film Anthropophagous, directed by Joe D'Amato in 1980.\n\nHe appeared in the 1985 biblical film King David as Goliath for a flashback. In 1986, he performed as Stefano in the movie Regalo di Natale, directed by Pupi Avati. Eastman quit acting in the late 1980s to concentrate on his writing assignments. He is now a decently-rated author in Italian television and only holds occasional roles. In 2003, he was one of the main characters in the movie La rivincita di Natale directed by Pupi Avati.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"

        "biography": "A born-and-bred New Yorker, Robert John Burke made his film debut while in his early 20s with a small part in the drama \"The Chosen\" (1981), based on the Chaim Potok story. He went on to study acting at SUNY Purchase where he met aspiring filmmaker Hal Hartley, who cast him as one of the leads in his debut feature \"The Unbelievable Truth,\" an offbeat indie tale where he played a man trying to escape his troubled past. Working with Hartley again on the charming brother-centric dark comedy \"Simple Men,\" Burke caught a major break when Hollywood producers decided that his chiseled jawline was the right one to replace Peter Weller's in the sci-fi/action sequel \"RoboCop 3.\" Despite Burke's efforts, the movie tanked, and he went on to smaller roles in major films, including the lauded Western \"Tombstone\" (1993) and the prison-break movie \"Fled\" (1996). Burke landed his second chance in a Hollywood starring role with the Stephen King adaptation \"Thinner\" (1996), but the macabre tale, which featured him under heavy makeup to depict a callous man who magically loses weight, was deemed almost universally unlikable.Though Burke's leading-man days were mostly behind him, his beastly role in Hartley's \"No Such Thing\" (2001) aside, he soldiered on, and began increasingly working on television with recurring roles on the grim prison drama \"Oz\" and the police procedural \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" (NBC, 1999- ). Appearing in George Clooney's first two movies as director, \"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\" (2002) and \"Good Night, and Good Luck.\" (2005), Burke nonetheless became more familiar to TV audiences, particularly when he signed on to play Mickey Gavin, the ex-priest cousin of Denis Leary's lead character on the firefighter series \"Rescue Me,\" a part that dovetailed with Burke's real-life second job as a New York State fireman.Often cast as a tough guy, the ruggedly handsome and tall actor continued to play imposing figures such as Major General James \"Chaos\" Mattis in the Iraq War miniseries \"Generation Kill\" (HBO, 2008) and Bart Bass, the controlling billionaire father of Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) on the soapy drama \"Gossip Girl.\" Before long, he was juggling his ongoing \"Law & Order: SVU\" part with regular spots on the military drama \"Army Wives\" (Lifetime, 2007- ) and the tense crime show \"Person of Interest\" (CBS, 2011- ), while still finding time for supporting turns in films, including the Denzel Washington/Mark Wahlberg action movie \"2 Guns\" (2013)."

        "biography": "Jo Raquel Welch (n\u00e9e Tejada; September 5, 1940 \u2013 February 15, 2023) was an American actress.\n\nWelch first garnered attention for her role in Fantastic Voyage (1966), after which she signed a long-term contract with 20th Century Fox. They lent her contract to the British studio Hammer Film Productions, for whom she made One Million Years B.C. (1966). Although Welch had only three lines of dialogue in the film, images of her in the doe-skin bikini became bestselling posters that turned her into an international sex symbol. She later starred in Bedazzled (1967), Bandolero! (1968), 100 Rifles (1969), Myra Breckinridge (1970), Hannie Caulder (1971), Kansas City Bomber (1972), The Last of Sheila (1973), The Three Musketeers (1973), The Wild Party (1975), and Mother, Jugs & Speed (1976). She made several television variety specials.\n\nThrough her portrayal of strong female characters, helping her break the mold of the traditional sex symbol, Welch developed a unique film persona that made her an icon of the 1960s and 1970s. Her rise to stardom in the mid-1960s was partly credited with ending Hollywood's vigorous promotion of the blonde bombshell.[1][2][3] Her love scene with Jim Brown in 100 Rifles also made cinematic history with their portrayal of interracial intimacy.[4] She won a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture Actress in a Musical or Comedy in 1974 for her performance as Constance Bonacieux in The Three Musketeers and reprised the role in its sequel the following year. She was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Television Film for her performance in Right to Die (1987). Her final film was How to Be a Latin Lover (2017). In 1995, Welch was chosen by Empire magazine as one of the \"100 Sexiest Stars in Film History\". Playboy ranked Welch No. 3 on their \"100 Sexiest Stars of the Twentieth Century\" list.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Raquel Welch, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia."

        "biography": "Ann Dvorak (born Anna McKim; August 2, 1911 \u2013 December 10, 1979) was an American stage and film actress. Asked how to pronounce her adopted surname, she told The Literary Digest: \"My fake name is properly pronounced vor'shack. The D remains silent.\"\n\nDvorak was the daughter and only child of silent film actress Anna Lehr and director Edwin McKim. While in New York, she attended St. Catherine's Convent. After moving to California, she attended Page School for Girls in Hollywood.\n\nShe made her film debut when she was five years old in the silent film version of Ramona (1916), credited as \"Baby Anna Lehr\". She continued in children's roles in The Man Hater (1917) and Five Dollar Plate (1920), but then stopped acting in films. Her parents separated in 1916 and divorced in 1920; she did not see her father again until 13 years later, when she made a public plea to the press to help her find him.\n\nIn the late 1920s, Dvorak worked as a dance instructor and gradually began to appear on film as a chorus girl. Her friend, actress Karen Morley, introduced her to billionaire movie producer Howard Hughes, who groomed her as a dramatic actress. She was a success in such pre-Code films as Scarface (1932) as Paul Muni's sister; in Three on a Match (1932) with Bette Davis and Joan Blondell as the doomed, unstable Vivian; in The Crowd Roars (1932) with James Cagney; and in Sky Devils (1932) opposite Spencer Tracy. Known for her style and elegance, she was a popular leading lady for Warner Bros. during the 1930s, and appeared in numerous contemporary romances and melodramas.  At age 19, Dvorak eloped with Leslie Fenton, her English co-star from The Strange Love of Molly Louvain (1932), and they married on March 17, 1932. They left for a year-long honeymoon in spite of her contractual obligations to the studio, which led to a period of litigation and pay disputes during which she discovered she was making the same amount of money as the boy who played her son in Three on a Match. She completed her contract on permanent suspension, then worked as a freelancer. Although she worked regularly, the quality of her scripts declined sharply.  She appeared as secretary Della Street to Donald Woods' Perry Mason in The Case of the Stuttering Bishop (1937). With her then-husband, Leslie Fenton, Dvorak traveled to England where she supported the war effort by working as an ambulance driver and acted in several British films. She appeared as a saloon singer in Abilene Town with Randolph Scott and Edgar Buchanan, released in 1946. The following year she adeptly handled comedy by giving an assured performance in Out of the Blue (1947). In 1948, Dvorak gave her only performance on Broadway in The Respectful Prostitute.\n\nDvorak's marriage to Fenton ended in divorce in 1946. In 1947, she married Igor Dega, a Russian dancer who danced with her briefly in The Bachelor's Daughters. The marriage ended two years later.\n\nDvorak retired from the screen in 1951, when she married her third and last husband, Nicholas Wade, to whom she remained married until his death in 1975. She had no children."

He worked in a circus and played semi-pro baseball while a teenager. In 1914, he married Olive Ireland and the pair became successful on the vaudeville circuit. Retired in his forties, he lost much of his money in the 1929 stock market crash and was forced to return to work. He played scores of roles in Westerns and non-Westerns alike, finally in the mid-1930s settling in to an almost exclusively Western career. He gained fame as Hopalong Cassidy's sidekick Windy Halliday in films between 1936 and 1939. Leaving the Cassidy films in a salary dispute, he was legally precluded from using the Windy nickname, and so took on the sobriquet Gabby, and was so billed from about 1940.  In his early films, he alternated between whiskered comic-relief sidekicks and clean-shaven bad guys, but by the later 1930s, he worked almost exclusively as a Western sidekick to stars such as John Wayne, Roy Rogers, and Randolph Scott. After his last film in 1950, he starred as the host of The Gabby Hayes Show.  He died on February 9, 1969."

        "biography": "Thomas Christopher \"Chris\" Parnell (born February 5, 1967) is an American comic actor best known as a cast member on Saturday Night Live from 1998\u20132006 and currently for his recurring role as Dr. Leo Spaceman on NBC's Emmy Award-winning comedy series 30 Rock. Parnell is currently one of the lead voices on the FX animated comedy Archer. In 2010, Parnell starred alongside his former SNL castmate Horatio Sanz in the Comedy Central series Big Lake.\n\nAfter performing as a company player with The Groundlings for a number of years, Parnell was hired to join the cast of Saturday Night Live as a featured player on September 26, 1998, and was promoted to repertory player the following season. In the summer of 2001, budget cuts and hiring four new cast members required Lorne Michaels to dismiss two cast members; he chose to lay off Parnell and Jerry Minor over Horatio Sanz, Rachel Dratch, and Maya Rudolph.\n\nWhile on SNL, Parnell appeared in numerous sketches, and commercial parodies, and performed memorable impressions of various celebrities. One of his most popular sketches is Lazy Sunday, a rap video he shot with Andy Samberg about buying cupcakes and going to see The Chronicles of Narnia. He has also performed raps about hosts Jennifer Garner, Britney Spears, Kirsten Dunst and Ashton Kutcher.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Lorne Michaels announced that four cast members would be fired due to budget cuts, but he did not say who. On September 22, 2006 it was announced that three cast members had been fired: Parnell, Horatio Sanz, and Finesse Mitchell. This effectively made him the only SNL performer to have been fired twice by Lorne Michaels, though Parnell did say in a 2008 interview with The Sound of Young America podcast that he was okay with being let go this time, because he was considering leaving after that season anyway, but added that he probably would have stayed one last season if he was asked back. He had been with SNL for eight seasons; at the time only four people (Darrell Hammond, Tim Meadows, Kevin Nealon, and Al Franken) have been cast members longer. He has since made uncredited cameo appearances on the show, most recently in 2008 parodying newscasters Tom Brokaw, Jim Lehrer, and Bob Schieffer.\n\nParnell and his former SNL castmate Horatio Sanz recently starred together in Big Lake, a 2010 sitcom on Comedy Central from executive producers Will Ferrell and Adam McKay.\n\nHe also recently appeared as Dr. Drummer/Santa in the SyFy Holiday Special episode from the television show Eureka, which aired on December 7, 2010 (Season 4 Episode 10)."

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nWild Bill Elliott (October 16, 1904 \u2013 November 26, 1965) was an American film actor. He specialized in playing the rugged heroes of B Westerns, particularly the Red Ryder series of films.  By 1925, he was getting occasional extra work in films. He took classes at the Pasadena Playhouse and appeared in a few stage roles there. By 1927, he had made his first Western, The Arizona Wildcat, playing his first featured role. Several co-starring roles followed, and he renamed himself Gordon Elliott. But as the studios made the transition to sound films, he slipped back into roles as an extra and bit parts, as in Broadway Scandals, in 1929. For the next eight years, he appeared in over a hundred films for various studios, but almost always in unbilled parts as an extra.\n\nElliott began to be noticed in some minor B Westerns, enough so that Columbia Pictures offered him the title role in a serial, The Great Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok (1938). The serial was so successful, and Elliott so personable, that Columbia promoted him to starring in his own series of Western features, replacing Columbia's number-two cowboy star Robert \"Tex\" Allen. Henceforth Gordon Elliott would be known as Bill Elliott. Within two years, he was among the Motion Picture Herald's Top Ten Western Stars, where he would remain for the next 15 years.\n\nIn 1943, Elliott signed with Republic Pictures, which cast him in a series of Westerns alongside George \"Gabby\" Hayes. The first of these, Calling Wild Bill Elliott, gave Elliott the name by which he would be best known and by which he would be billed almost exclusively for the rest of his career.\n\nFollowing several films in which both actor and character shared the name Wild Bill Elliott, he took the role for which he would be best remembered, that of Red Ryder in a series of sixteen movies about the famous comic strip cowboy and his young Indian companion, Little Beaver (played in Elliott's films by Bobby Blake). Elliott played the role for only two years but would forever be associated with it. Elliott's trademark was a pair of six guns worn butt-forward in their holsters.\n\nElliott's career thrived during and after the Red Ryder films, and he continued making B Westerns into the early 1950s. He also had his own radio show during the late 1940s. His final contract as a Western star was with Monogram Pictures, where budgets declined as the B Western lost its audience to television. When Monogram became Allied Artists Pictures Corporation in 1953, it phased out its Western productions, and Elliott finished out his contract playing a homicide detective in a series of five modern police dramas, his first non-Westerns since 1938.\n\nElliott retired from films (except for a couple of TV Western pilots which were not picked up). He worked for a time as a spokesman for Viceroy cigarettes and hosted a local TV program in Las Vegas, Nevada, which featured many of his Western films."

These films gave Chen status as a \"legitimate actor\". After starring in the box office successes Challenge of the Masters and Executioners from Shaolin, both helmed by the legendary martial arts director Lau Kar-leung, Chen left the Shaw Brothers Studio.\n\nWhile away from Shaw, Chen directed and starred in the 1977 film Iron Monkey (not to be confused with the 1993 film by Yuen Woo-Ping). Chen later returned to the Shaw Brothers in the films Crippled Avengers (directed by Chang Cheh), Killer Constable (directed by Chih-hung Kwei), and 3 Evil Masters (co-starring Yuen Tak of the Seven Little Fortunes).\n\nTo date Chen has starred in over 100 films, around 80 of which were with Shaw Brothers.

        "biography": "Dennis Lee Hopper (May 17, 1936 \u2013 May 29, 2010) was an American actor, filmmaker and artist. As a young man, Hopper became interested in acting and eventually became a student of the Actors' Studio. He made his first television appearance in 1954, and appeared in two films featuring James Dean, Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and Giant (1956). During the next 10 years, Hopper appeared frequently on television in guest roles, and by the end of the 1960s had played supporting roles in several films. He directed and starred in Easy Rider (1969), winning an award at the Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay as co-writer. \"With its portrait of counterculture heroes raising their middle fingers to the uptight middle-class hypocrisies, Easy Rider became the cinematic symbol of the 1960s, a celluloid anthem to freedom, macho bravado and anti-establishment rebellion.\" Film critic Matthew Hays notes that \"no other persona better signifies the lost idealism of the 1960s than that of Dennis Hopper.\" He was unable to build on his success for several years, until a featured role in Apocalypse Now (1979) brought him attention. He subsequently appeared in Rumble Fish (1983) and The Osterman Weekend (1983), and received critical recognition for his work in Blue Velvet and Hoosiers, with the latter film garnering him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He directed Colors (1988) and played the villain in Speed (1994). Hopper's later work included a leading role in the television series Crash. Hopper's last performance was filmed just before his death: The Last Film Festival, slated for a 2011 release. Hopper was also a prolific and acclaimed photographer, a profession he began in the 1960s.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"

Attending St Aloysius College, he developed a love for being a creative, which was followed by studying software and web design. Having always felt the urge to perform and entertain from a young age, Davide drew his inspiration from the actors, singers and public figures throughout his upbringing.\n\nSinging was always Davide\u2019s passion and helped him break into the industry. His first role was in the hit musical \u201cSpring Awakening\u201d (2010) at St James Theatre as Georg. A successful run of the award winning show confirmed his love for the arts, as well as launched him unexpectedly into  a modeling career.\n\n\u201cLa Famiglia\u201d (2011) the Maltese television crime drama was Davide\u2019s first small screen role, portraying Valentino Saraceni.

        "biography": "Randal Keith Orton is an American professional wrestler and actor. Widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time he is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the Raw brand and is one half of the current Raw Tag Team Champions with Riddle in their second reign. Orton is a third generation professional wrestler; his grandfather Bob Orton, father Bob Orton Jr., and uncle Barry Orton were all wrestlers. Before being signed by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), he trained in and wrestled for the Mid-Missouri Wrestling Association and Southern Illinois Conference Wrestling. He was then signed by the WWF and was sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), where he held the OVW Hardcore Championship twice. He became a member of the stable Evolution shortly after his WWE debut, which quickly led to an Intercontinental Championship reign, his first championship with the company. He also acquired the moniker \"The Legend Killer\" during a storyline where he began disrespecting and then physically attacking WWE Hall of Famers and wrestling veterans. At the age of 24, Orton became the youngest world champion in WWE history after he won the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. With this win, he departed from Evolution and a feud with his former stablemates began. In 2006, Orton joined forces with Edge in a tag team known as Rated-RKO. Together, they held the World Tag Team Championship. After Rated-RKO disbanded in mid-2007, Orton gained two WWE Championship reigns in one night, becoming the second youngest two-time WWE Champion at the age of 27. He formed the group The Legacy with Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase Jr. in 2008. They disbanded in 2010, and Orton returned to singles competition. From 2013 to 2015, he was aligned with The Authority, who named him the \"face of the WWE\". In 2016, he joined The Wyatt Family, winning the SmackDown Tag Team Championship with Bray Wyatt and Luke Harper before turning on them in 2017. He won his first United States Championship in 2018, becoming the 18th overall Grand Slam Champion after already having been the 17th Triple Crown Champion. Orton has held the WWE Championship 10 times and WWE's World Heavyweight Championship four times. He was the final holder of the World Heavyweight Championship, which he unified with the WWE Championship to become the WWE World Heavyweight Champion at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs in 2013. Orton is recognized by WWE as having the third-most world championship victories in history at 14, behind John Cena and Ric Flair (both 16) and tied with Triple H (also at 14). All totaled, Orton has won 20 championships in WWE. He is also the winner of the 2013 Money in the Bank ladder match, as well as a two time Royal Rumble match winner (2009 and 2017) and has headlined multiple WWE pay-per-view events, including WrestleMania 25 and WrestleMania XXX. Following his match at the 2021 Survivor Series, he broke Kane's record for wrestling the most PPV matches in WWE history."

The record won a Grammy Award and peaked at No. 23 on the Billboard Hot 100. She then starred in the lead role of Set It Off (1996) and released her fourth album, Order in the Court, on June 16, 1998, with Motown Records.

From 2016 to 2019, she starred as Carlotta Brown in the musical drama series Star. In 2020, she portrayed Hattie McDaniel in the miniseries Hollywood.\n\nQueen Latifah has been referred to as the \"Queen of Rap\" by several media articles, as well as \"rap's first feminist\". Latifah became the first hip hop artist to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (2006). Latifah's work in music, film and television has earned her a Grammy Award, an Emmy Award, a Golden Globe Award, three Screen Actors Guild Awards, two NAACP Image Awards, and an Academy Award nomination.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Queen Latifah, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia."

He made his acting debut in 1992, playing a small role in the Japanese drama Ippai no kakesoba. In the following years, he worked as a model for companies like Calvin Klein and Issey Miyake. In 2001, he starred in the movie Toki no kaori: Remember me (a remake of the Korean film Ditto), while in 2006, he participated as Y\u016bshi Oshitari in the musical adaptation of the manga The Prince of Tennis, a role that made him gain popularity as an actor.\n\nAlso, in 2006, he played Sh\u016bya Arisada in the drama Princess princess D, an adaptation of the homonymous manga by Mikiyo Tsuda. However, his most important role was undoubtedly that of Noeru Kisaragi in the direct-to-video movie BOYS LOVE. The film tells the story of a magazine editor who meets and interviews a young model (later he also discovers that he is a gigolo) and the immediate attraction that arises between them. After the success of the film, the following year a theatrical successor to it was released (titled Schoolboy Crush in the West), but with a different plot and without Saitoh's involvement.\n\nAnother of his most important works is Sukitomo, another homosexual-themed film, released in 2007, and Itsuka no kimi e, also released that same year. The expressiveness of Saitoh as an actor and his natural way of embarking homosexual characters has contributed to give a \"normalized\" image of homosexual love in Japan, to the point of making it accessible and understandable to the general public. However, he ran the risk of being caught in a series of characters of that nature, so he joined the cast of the lightweight 2007 drama Delicious Gakuin. He participated in the 2009 graduation special of the Gokusen drama series and in HANA-KIMI 2011, the second Japanese TV adaptation of the comics of the same title."

In his movies, he is known for his acrobatic fighting style, comic timing, use of improvised weapons, and innovative stunts. Jackie Chan has been acting since the 1970s and has appeared in over 100 films.\n\nChan has received stars on the Hong Kong Avenue of Stars and the Hollywood Walk of Fame. As a cultural icon, Chan has been referenced in various pop songs, cartoons, and video games. Chan is also a Cantopop and Mandopop star, having released a number of albums and sung many of the theme songs for the films in which he has starred.\n\nChan was born on April 7, 1954, in Victoria Peak, in the former Crown colony of Hong Kong, as Chan Kong-sang (meaning \"born in Hong Kong\") to Charles and Lee-Lee Chan, refugees from the Chinese Civil War. He was nicknamed Paopao (Chinese: \u70ae\u70ae, literally meaning \"Cannonball\") because he was such a big baby, weighing 12 pounds, or about 5.4 kgs. Since his parents worked for the French Consul to Hong Kong, Chan spent his formative years within the grounds of the consul's residence in the Victoria Peak district. Chan attended the Nah-Hwa Primary School on Hong Kong Island, where he failed his first year, after which his parents withdrew him from the school.\n\nIn 1960, his father immigrated to Canberra, Australia, to work as the head cook for the American embassy, and Chan was sent to the China Drama Academy, a Peking Opera School run by Master Yu Jim-yuen. Chan trained rigorously for the next decade, excelling in martial arts and acrobatics. He eventually became part of the Seven Little Fortunes, a performance group made up of the school's best students, gaining the stage name Yuen Lo in homage to his master. Chan became close friends with fellow group members Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, the three of them later to be known as the Three Brothers or Three Dragons. At the age of 17, he worked as a stuntman in the Bruce Lee films Fist of Fury and Enter the Dragon under the stage name Chan Yuen Lung. He received his first starring role later that year, in Little Tiger of Canton, which had a limited release in Hong Kong in 1973."

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nWolfgang Preiss (27 February 1910 at Nuremberg - 27 November 2002 at Baden-Baden) was a German theatre, film and television actor.\n\nThe son of a teacher, in the early 1930s Preiss studied philosophy, German and drama. He also took private acting classes with Hans Schlenck, making his stage d\u00e9but in Munich in 1932. He went to appear in various theatre productions in Heidelberg, K\u00f6nigsberg, Bonn, Bremen, Stuttgart and Berlin.\n\nIn 1942 he made his film d\u00e9but - he was exempted from military service specifically - in the UFA production Die grosse Liebe with Zarah Leander. After the end of the Second World War Preiss returned to the theatre, and from 1949 worked extensively dubbing films into German.\n\nIn 1954 he returned to film acting, appearing in Alfred Weidenmann's Canaris. The following year Preiss played the lead role of Claus von Stauffenberg in Falk Harnack's film Der 20. Juli, which dramatised the 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler. This role brought Preiss to popular attention and also the 1956 Federal Film Award.\n\nFrom now on Preiss was largely typecast in the role of the upright and obligation-conscious German officer to the other A-list actor playing the Fanatic (I.E. Paul Scofeld in The Train) a part he played in many films, later reprising it in numerous international productions, predominantly in Italy and the USA, while occasionally playing a more typically cynical or brutal Nazi officer.\n\nPreiss appeared in such productions as The Longest Day (1962), Otto Preminger's The Cardinal (1963), and with Jean-Paul Belmondo in Is Paris Burning? (1966). He starred alongside Burt Lancaster in John Frankenheimer's The Train (1964), Frank Sinatra in Von Ryan's Express (1965), Robert Mitchum in Anzio (1968), with Richard Burton, in the title role of Erwin Rommel in Raid on Rommel (1971), and The Boys From Brazil (1978) with Gregory Peck. He also appeared in several Italian language films, credited as \"Luppo Prezzo\", and played Field Marshal Von Rundstedt in Richard Attenborough's all-star war epic A Bridge Too Far (1977).\n\nIn addition, for the cinema-going public of West Germany he became the epitome of the evil genius in his role as Doctor Mabuse, a role he first played in 1960 (following Rudolf Klein-Rogge) in Fritz Lang's The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse. He went on to play the role four more times.\n\nIn the 1980s Preiss turned to television, notably playing General Walther von Brauchitsch in the American TV mini-series Winds of War and War and Remembrance, based on the books of Herman Wouk.\n\nIn 1987 received a second Federal Film Award for his outstanding work in film.\n\nIn film dubbing Preiss provided the voice for such actors as Lex Barker, Christopher Lee, Anthony Quinn, Claude Rains, Richard Widmark, as well as that of Conrad Veidt as \"Major Strasser\" in the remastered version of Casablanca.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Wolfgang Preiss, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia."

The son of a precious wood merchant, he grew up in a united Christian family with his parents and his sister. Enrolled at Victoria College, a prestigious British school in Alexandria, the teenager studied science, and foreign languages, and would later discover theater classes. A brilliant student, he continued his studies at Cairo University where he obtained his diploma in mathematics and physics.\n\nCaught up in his taste for acting, he was spotted at 21 by director Youssef Chahine who offered him a leading role in Struggle in the Valley (1954). The success was immediate, thanks to this role, the young leading man walked the red carpet of the Croisette at the Cannes Film Festival the same year. He became a star of Egyptian cinema then in full expansion, and collaborated again with Youssef Chahine (The Devil of the Desert, Black Waters). In 1962, he took on the role of Prince Sherif Ali in Lawrence of Arabia under the direction of David Lean. This film, the first outside Egypt for the actor, marks the beginning of a long friendship with Peter O'Toole and a turning point in Omar Sharif's career. He won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor and decided to leave his native country for Hollywood. In 1955, Omar Sharif married the Egyptian actress Faten Hamama, whom he met on the set of Struggle in the Valley, and for whom he converted to Islam. Their son Tarek was born in 1957. The couple separated when the actor decided to pursue his career in Hollywood. Their divorce was finalized a few years later in 1974.  The actor, a polyglot, then began an international career. David Lean offered him a new emblematic role with Doctor Zhivago (1965) in which he played opposite Geraldine Chaplin. His filmography includes more than a hundred films. The actor nevertheless had a more unhappy period on the big screen with some commercial failures (And Came the Day of Vengeance, The Rendezvous, The Horsemen). He returned to success in the 2000s with Monsieur Ibrahim and The Flowers of the Koran by Fran\u00e7ois Dupeyron for which he was awarded the C\u00e9sar for Best Actor in 2004. The same year, he starred in Hidalgo by Joe Johnston. Rarer on film sets, in 2009 he accepted the role of a painter suffering from Alzheimer's disease in I Forgot to Tell You alongside Emilie Dequenne. He appeared in his last film, Rock the Casbah by La\u00efla Marrakchi, in 2012.\n\nIn May 2015, his son, Tarek El-Sharif, announced in an interview that Omar Sharif had Alzheimer's disease. He died on July 10, 2015 following a heart attack. His funeral took place on July 12, 2015 in a mosque in Cairo and he was buried at the Sayyeda Nefisa cemetery in the south of the city."

She was prominently a full-time Mediacorp artiste from 1995 to 2001 but continues to film on an ad-hoc basis and managed under Hype Records. She left Mediacorp after her contract expired and chose not to renew it.\n\nPhyllis Quek's entry to Singapore showbiz was through Star Search 1995, in which she garnered a third placing. Despite this, a stunning performance in her debut drama serial, Beyond Dawn (\u5973\u5b50\u76d1\u72f1), left an indelible impression in the hearts of viewers. She was subsequently awarded the Best Newcomer Award at MediaCorp's Star Awards ceremony in 1996.\n\nPhyllis struck gold when MediaCorp Raintree Pictures offered her a lead role opposite Hong Kong megastar Aaron Kwok and Daniel Wu in a Hong Kong-Singapore joint collaboration movie, 2000 A.D.. Through this action flick, she won attention in the Asian media and is noted to have a high potential in local book Singapore Cinema by Rapha\u00ebl Millet. She subsequently followed this up with a supporting role as a policewoman in another Raintree Pictures film, The Tree (\u5b69\u5b50\u6811).\n\nHer recording of the theme song of her earlier drama, The Other Parent (\u5988\u5988\u5148\u751f) and Mind Games (\u5371\u9669\u4eba\u7269) marked the start of a nascent career in singing. She then released her debut album, Phyllis, under Hype Records which contained primarily dance tunes and singles from the soundtrack of The Tree and Beyond The Axis Of Truth (\u6cd5\u533bX\u6863\u6848). To promote her album, Phyllis guest starred in a Channel 5's crime drama series Heartlanders 2 where she played a stalked actress. That particular episode featured her song, '\u4e0d\u77e5\u4e0d\u89c9', thrice and was a radio hit along with her other singles, 'Freedom'. However, the album did not mark the start of a longstanding music career for Phyllis and it was to remain her first and only album.\n\nAs soon as her contract expired in 2001, she made a critical decision to switch to another management company, Hype Records Artiste Networks after she enjoyed working with them whilst producing her debut album. In keeping with Hype Records' plans for regionalisation, Phyllis made another conscious decision to star in productions from primarily the East Asian region (including Taiwan and China). She made her debut in Taiwan headlining the wacky lead role in a fluffy idol drama titled My Fair Lady (\u4e11\u5973\u5927\u7ffb\u8eab), in which she donned fatsuits and prosthetics in order to play a fat and undesired girl."

Nielsen's performances in the films Forbidden Planet (1956) and The Poseidon Adventure (1972) received positive reviews as a serious actor, though he is primarily known for his comedic roles.\n\nAlthough Nielsen's acting career crossed a variety of genres in both television and films, his deadpan delivery in Airplane! (1980) marked a turning point in his career, one that would make him, in the words of film critic Roger Ebert, \"the Olivier of spoofs.\" Nielsen enjoyed further success with The Naked Gun film series (1988 \u2013 1994), based on a short-lived television series Police Squad! in which he starred earlier. His portrayal of serious characters seemingly oblivious to (and complicit in) their absurd surroundings gave him a reputation as a comedian. In the final years of his career, Nielsen appeared in multiple spoof and parody films, many of which were met poorly by critics, but performed well in box office and home media releases. Nielsen married four times and had two daughters from his second marriage. He was recognized with a variety of awards throughout his career, and was inducted into the Canada and Hollywood Walks of Fame.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Leslie Nielsen, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia"

From 2006 to 2008, he was a member of the Jamel Comedy Club before launching his own one-man show.\n\nThe youngest of ten children, Wahid Bouzidi grew up in Bobigny. He lost his mother then his father two months apart when he was only 15 years old. Subsequently, he lived in Noisy-le-Sec with his older brother Ahmed who became his legal guardian. The sudden loss of his parents plunges Wahid Bouzidi into a period of silence. It was within a Gagny theater troupe, named Les Guez Guez, that he found an outlet for his grief and revealed a talent for the performing arts.\n\nWahid Bouzidi was revealed in 2004, at the age of 26, by the director Guy Jacques who gave him a first role in the cinema in the feature film Ze Film. From there, Wahid took theater classes in Bondy in the Guezguez troupe for 2 years. In 2005, Kader Aoun, who was looking for young talents to join the Canal+ show Jamel Comedy Club (produced and presented by Jamel Debbouze), contacted Wahid Bouzidi who refused. Invited to attend the rehearsals of the first troupe of the Jamel Comedy Club, he wrote his first text: Le Gitan the same evening. The next day, he presented his text to Kader Aoun then twenty minutes later, he went on stage with the troupe. It was there that he discovered stand-up and presented his own shows including Wahid Se Lache and Graisse Anatomie.\n\nIn the cinema, he mainly plays in comedies such as Case D\u00e9part, Beur Sur La Ville, Mohamed Dubois, Alad'2 and BDE.

He is credited on the poster under the sole first name of Wahid. In 2017 and 2018, he participated in Marrakech Du Rire hosted by Jamel Debbouze. For his latest show entitled \"Wahid\u2026 Il Se Rel\u00e8ve\u201d, performed from January to June 2023, Wahid Bouzidi draws inspiration from his health problems that occurred from 20214, evoking loneliness and mistreatment in the hospital. The show revolves around his experience in the hospital where he felt disappointed towards some of those around him. However, he highlights the unconditional support of his wife and his friend Booder. He talks about \u201cwhite visiting rooms\u201d, in reference to relatives who had promised to come see him, but who never did. The production, directed by Papy, begins with Bouzidi in a wheelchair, before he gradually gets up.\n\nOn August 16, 2023, Wahid Bouzidi suffered a new stroke while on vacation in Marrakech, which plunged him into a coma. He died on August 20, 20238.9 He was buried in Algeria near Tolga."

        "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nLloyd Benedict Nolan (August 11, 1902 \u2013 September 27, 1985) was an American film and television actor.  Among his many roles, Nolan is remembered for originating the role of private investigator Michael Shayne in a series of 1940s B movies.\n\nNolan was born in San Francisco, California, the son of Margaret and James Nolan, who was a shoe manufacturer of Irish descent. He attended Santa Clara Preparatory School and Stanford University, flunking out of Stanford as a freshman \"because I never got around to attending any other class but dramatics.\" His parents disapproved of his choice of a career in acting, preferring that he join his father's shoe business, \"one of the most solvent commercial firms in San Francisco.\"\n\nNolan served in the United States Merchant Marine before joining the Dennis Players theatrical troupe in Cape Cod. He began his career on stage and was subsequently lured to Hollywood, where he played mainly doctors, private detectives, and policemen in many film roles.\n\nNolan also contributed solid and key character parts in numerous other films. One, The House on 92nd Street, was a startling revelation to audiences in 1945. It was a conflation of several true incidents of attempted sabotage by the Nazi regime (incidents which the FBI was able to thwart during World War II), and many scenes were filmed on location in New York City, unusual at the time. Nolan portrayed FBI Agent Briggs, and actual FBI employees interacted with Nolan throughout the film; he reprised the role in a subsequent 1948 movie, The Street with No Name.\n\nNolan appeared three times on NBC's Laramie Western series, as sheriff Tully Hatch in the episode \"The Star Trail (1959), as outlaw Matt Dyer in the episode \"Deadly Is the Night\" (1961)[5] and then as former Union Army General George Barton in the episode \"War Hero\" (1962).[6] On December 8, 1960, Nolan was cast as Dr. Elisha Pittman, in \"Knife of Hate\" on Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre. In the story line, Dr. Pittman removed one of the legs of Jack Hoyt (Robert Harland) after Hoyt sustained a gunshot wound from which infection was developing. Hoyt wants to marry Susan Pittman (Susan Oliver), but her father is at first unyielding on the matter.\n\nNolan starred in The Outer Limits episode \"Soldier\" written by Harlan Ellison. He appeared in the NBC Western Bonanza as LaDuke, a New Orleans detective. In 1967, Strother Martin and he guest-starred in the episode \"A Mighty Hunter Before the Lord\" of NBC's The Road West series, starring Barry Sullivan. Also in 1967, Nolan was a guest star in the popular Western TV series The Virginian, in the episode \"The Masquerade\" and in the first episode of Mannix.\n\nA long-time cigar and pipe smoker, Nolan died of lung cancer on September 27, 1985, at his home in Brentwood, California; he was 83. He is interred at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Westwood, Los Angeles, California.

While she was in Taiwan and preparing for her album release, Anya, became the first girl DJ in Taiwan clubs. She caught alot of media attention, even media from Hong Kong. With so much public attention, her interview in a magazine caught the eye of Director Jingle Ma, who then convinced Golden Harvest, a film production, distribution and exhibition company to relocate her to Hong Kong and sign her. Unfortunately, by the time they found her, he had already started \"Moi Moi Cha\", the movie in which he had wanted her for. So her debut film became Born To Be King, the final installment of the Young & Dangerous series,as Jordan Chan's wife, Nanako. Relocating to Hong Kong, Anya's profile has increased swiftly with Golden Harvest's support. She has since had larger roles in several of the studio's post-millenium efforts. She appeared as one of Ekin Cheng's many girls in For Bad Boys Only and in 2001 took more action-oriented roles in two hot action films. Sharp Guns and 2002, where her Fire Ghost menaced Stephen Fung and Nicholas Tse. She went on to become one of the top upcoming actresses in both Hong Kong and Taiwan and with her undoubtable gorgeous looks has also graced numerous magazine covers, print ads, and TV shows in both regions. In 2002, Anya began work on the \"remake/sequel\" to Naked Killer, titled Naked Weapon as Kat, the best friend to Charlene, Maggie Q's character. She also recently worked in HK on a stage play Glengarry Glenross in which she took on the challenging role of Blake that has been always played by a man. Tickets were sold out and another day had to be added. Afterwards, she starred in Tsui Hark's thriller Vampire Hunters as Sasa. After the liquidation of Golden Harvest's talent agency, Anya decided to go back to her native Taiwan and experiment on some TV series there. There she did starred in a TV series called Pink Godfather, as well as Taiwan's version of \"Sex And The City\" where she played \"Samantha\". After being there for a year, she realized that her focus was still more in films, and headed to join the fierce competitive, but growing industry in China. Being fluent in Chinese as well as English, her current works are on co-productions with China and foreign production companies."

The two appeared in a number of plays before Lawrence was given a film contract with Columbia Pictures. Lawrence appeared in films beginning in 1931. Garfield followed, starting his film career in 1938. Lawrence's pock-marked complexion, brooding appearance and New York street-guy accent made him a natural for heavies, and he played scores of gangsters and mob bosses over the next six decades. Later, Lawrence found himself under scrutiny for his political leanings. When called before the House Un-American Activities Committee, he admitted he had once been a member of the Communist Party. He named Sterling Hayden, Lionel Stander, Anne Revere, Larry Parks, Karen Morley and Jeff Corey as Communists. He was blacklisted and departed for Europe, where he continued to make films. Following the demise of the blacklist, he returned to America and resumed his position as a familiar and talented purveyor of gangland types. He played gangsters in two James Bond movies: 1971's Diamonds Are Forever opposite Sean Connery, and 1974's The Man with the Golden Gun opposite Roger Moore. He also portrayed a henchman opposite Laurence Olivier in Marathon Man (1976) and a stereotypical Miami mob boss alongside Jerry Reed and Dom DeLuise in the comedy Hot Stuff (1979).\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Marc Lawrence, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia."

        "place_of_birth": "Columbia, South Carolina, USA",
        "biography": "Barton MacLane graduated from Wesleyan University, where he displayed a notable aptitude for sports, in particular football and basketball. Not surprisingly, his physical prowess led to an early role in The Quarterback (1926) with Richard Dix. MacLane once commented that, as an actor, he needed to have the physical strength to tear the bad guys \"from limb to limb\", if necessary. Ironically, it was usually Barton himself who was destined to be at the end of a hiding (when not getting shot, instead), typically as snarling henchmen, outlaws and other assorted dubious or abrasive types throughout most of his 40-year acting career. In fact, Barton became so typecast that his name was for a time used proverbially, to generally describe a shouting, hard-nosed ruffian.\n\nAfter training at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, MacLane joined a stock company in Brooklyn. In 1927 he had his first part on Broadway, a brief moment as an assistant district attorney, in the melodrama \"The Trial of Mary Dugan\". He then played a small featured role as a police officer in \"Subway Express\" (1929-30), a drama enacted in the interior of a subway car. In mid-1932 MacLane tried his hand at writing his own starring vehicle for the stage, entitled \"Rendezvous\". While the play closed after just 21 performances, it led to a contract with Warner Brothers.\n\nBarton had already appeared in bit roles for Paramount at their Astoria Studios, including The Marx Brothers' debut film The Cocoanuts (1929). He portrayed mobster Brad Collins in 'G' Men (1935) (with James Cagney), which set the tone for most of his future assignments. Brawny, with squinty eyes and a rasping voice, MacLane was the ideal surly tough guy, particularly suitable for westerns and the type of films noir Warner Brothers excelled at. He was often cast as cops, be they bent or honest. Some of his most representative performances include gangster Al Kruger in Bullets or Ballots (1936), which won him some of the best critical notices of his career; outlaw Jack Slade in Western Union (1941); crooked construction boss Pat McCormick, who gets beaten up by Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt over past-due wages in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948); hard-nosed cops Detective Dundy in The Maltese Falcon (1941) and Lt. Reece in Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye (1950). MacLane, on loan to Universal, also had a starring role in Prison Break (1938) as an innocent tuna fisherman who is framed for murder. He was prominent as a tough but sympathetic cop, foil to sleuthing girl reporter Glenda Farrell in the \"Torchy Blaine\" series of the mid- to late 1930s. In the 1960s Barton began to cultivate a good-guy image as Marshal Frank Caine in the NBC western series Outlaws (1960) as well as showing up in a small recurring role as Air Force Gen. Martin Peterson in I Dream of Jeannie (1965).\n\nBarton was married to the actress Charlotte Wynters, who appeared with him in six of his films. When not on the set, the couple spent time on their 2000-acre cattle ranch in Madera County, California.\n\nFor his work in television, Barton has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame."

        "biography": "American character actor whose career lasted nearly half a century. James Wilson Flavin Jr. was the son of a hotel waiter of Canadian-English extraction and a mother, Katherine, whose father was an Irish immigrant. (Thus Flavin, well-known in Hollywood as an \"Irish\" type, was only one-quarter Irish.) Flavin was born and raised in Portland, Maine (a fact that may have enrichened his later working relationship with director John Ford, also a Portland native). He attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, but (contrary to some sources) did not graduate. Instead he dropped out and returned to Portland where he drove a taxi. Then as now, summer stock companies flocked to Maine each year, and in 1929 he was asked to fill in for an actor. He did well with the part and the company manager offered him $150 per week to go with the troupe back to New York. Flavin accepted and by the spring of 1930 was living in a rooming house at 108 W. 87th Street in Manhattan. Flavin didn't manage to crack Broadway at this time (his Broadway debut would not occur for another thirty-nine years, in the 1971 revival of \"The Front Page,\" in which Flavin played Murphy and briefly took over the lead role of Walter Burns from star Robert Ryan). He worked his way across the country in stock productions and tours, arriving in Los Angeles around 1932. He quickly made the transition to movies, landing the lead in his very first film, a Universal serial, The Airmail Mystery (1932). He also landed his leading lady, marrying the serial's female star Lucile Browne that same year. However, the serial marked virtually the last time that Flavin would play the lead in a film. Thereafter, he was restricted almost exclusively to supporting characters, many of them without so much as a name. He specialized in uniformed cops and hard-bitten detectives, but played chauffeurs, cabbies, and even a 16th-century palace guard with aplomb. Flavin appeared in nearly four hundred films between 1932 and 1971, and in almost a hundred television episodes before his final appearance, as President Dwight D. Eisenhower in Francis Gary Powers: The True Story of the U-2 Spy Incident (1976). Flavin died of a heart ailment at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on April 23, 1976. His widow Lucile died seventeen days later. They were survived by their son, William James Flavin, subsequently a professor at the United States Army War College. James and Lucile Brown Flavin were buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California."

        "biography": "Paul Albert Anka (born July 30, 1941) is a Canadian-American singer, songwriter and actor. He is best known for his signature hit songs including \"Diana\", \"Lonely Boy\", \"Put Your Head on My Shoulder\", and \"(You're) Having My Baby\". Anka also wrote the theme for The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson; one of Tom Jones' biggest hits, \"She's a Lady\"; and the English lyrics to Claude Fran\u00e7ois and Jacques Revaux's music for Frank Sinatra's signature song \"My Way\", which has been recorded by many, including Elvis Presley. He co-wrote three songs with Michael Jackson: \"This Is It\" (originally titled \"I Never Heard\") \"Love Never Felt So Good\", and \"Don't Matter to Me\", which became posthumous hits for Jackson in 2009, 2014, and 2018, respectively.\n\nAnka was born in Ottawa, Ontario, to Camelia (n\u00e9e Tannis) and Andrew Emile \"Andy\" Anka Sr., who owned a restaurant called the Locanda. His parents were both of Lebanese descent. His father came to Canada from Bab Tuma, Damascus, Syria, and his mother was an immigrant from Lebanon. His mother died when he was 18.\n\nAnka sang with the St. Elias Antiochian Orthodox Cathedral choir under the direction of Frederick Karam, with whom he studied music theory. He studied piano with Winnifred Rees. He attended Fisher Park High School, where he was part of a vocal trio called the Bobby Soxers.\n\nPaul Anka recorded his first single, \"I Confess\", when he was 14. In 1956, with $100 given to him by his uncle, he went to New York City where he auditioned for Don Costa at ABC Records, singing what was widely believed to be a lovestruck verse he had written to a former babysitter. In an interview with NPR's Terry Gross in 2005, he stated that it was to a girl at his church whom he hardly knew. The resulting song \"Diana\" brought Anka stardom as it went to No. 1 on the Canadian and US music charts. \"Diana\" is one of the best selling singles ever by a Canadian recording artist. He followed up with four songs that made it into the Top 20 in 1958, including \"It's Time to Cry\", which hit No. 4 and \"(All of a Sudden) My Heart Sings\", which reached No. 15, making him (at 17) one of the biggest teen idols of the time. He toured Britain, then Australia with Buddy Holly. Anka also wrote \"It Doesn't Matter Anymore\" \u2013 a song written for Holly, which Holly recorded just before he died in 1959. Anka stated shortly afterward: \"It Doesn't Matter Anymore\" has a tragic irony about it now, but at least it will help look after Buddy Holly's family. I'm giving my composer's royalty to his widow \u2013 it's the least I can do.\" ...\n\nSource: Article \"Paul Anka\" from Wikipedia in English, licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0."

Her mother, Marina Alyabysheva, divorced her father, Konstantin Kurylenko, soon after her birth. After the divorce, her mother struggled to survive as an art teacher. Young Olga Kurylenko was brought up by her mother and her grandmother, Raisa. During her youth, Olga had a humbling experience of living in poverty; she had no choice but to wear rags and had to darn the holes on her sweater. During the years in Ukraine she studied art, languages, did 7 years of musical school studying piano and went to a ballet studio until 13.\n\nAt age 13, Olga and her mother made a trip to Moscow. There she was scouted by an agent who approached her at a subway station and offered a job as a model. Initially, Olga's mother was suspicious, but eventually Olga made a good career choice and took training as a model in Moscow. By age 16, she was ready for the next step. She moved to Paris, learned French in six months, and was signed by the Madison agency. At age 18, Olga appeared on the cover of Glamour, then she graced magazine covers of Elle, Madame Figaro, Marie Claire, and Vogue, and also became the face of Lejaby lingerie, Bebe clothing, Clarins and Helena Rubinstein cosmetic companies.\n\nIn 1999, Olga married her friend, French photographer Cedric Van Mol and divorced him three and a half years later. One day Olga presented herself to an acting agency. Eventually, she swapped the catwalk for celluloid, and her acting career took off. In 2005 she made her film debut as Iris, a sensual beauty in L'annulaire (2005) by director Diane Bertrand.\n\nShe appeared opposite Elijah Wood in Paris, je t'aime (2006) and as Sofia in Le serpent (2006), then co-starred as Russian beauty Nika Boronina opposite Timothy Olyphant in Hitman (2007/I). She also appears as Mina Harud in the indy surveillance-thriller \"Tyranny\" (2008) and is billed as Camille, the Bond girl in Quantum of Solace (2008), a sequel to Casino Royale (2006)."

Widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time, he is tied with Ric Flair for the most world championship reigns in professional wrestling history.\n\nBorn and raised in West Newbury, Massachusetts, Cena moved to California in 1998 to pursue a career as a bodybuilder. He transitioned to professional wrestling in 1999 when he debuted for Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW). He signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 2001, where he was initially assigned to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). He gained fame in the WWE after adopting the persona of a trash-talking rapper. He won his first singles title, the United States Championship, in 2004. The next year, he won the WWE Championship for the first time, and his character subsequently transitioned into a clean-cut \"Superman-like\" hero. He then led the company as its franchise player, and public face for the next decade.\n\nA joint-record 16-time world champion, Cena has won the WWE Championship thirteen times, a record for the title. He is also a five-time United States Champion, a four-time world tag team champion, a two-time Royal Rumble match winner, a one-time Money in the Bank match winner, and has headlined several major WWE pay-per-view events, including their flagship event, WrestleMania, five times. His professional wrestling career has been met with mixed critical and audience reception, with praise for his character work and promotional skills, but criticism for his supposed over-representation and on-screen placement relative to other wrestlers.\n\nCena first starred in The Marine (2006), and gained praise for his performances in Trainwreck (2015), Ferdinand (2017), Blockers, and Bumblebee (both 2018). He starred in F9 and portrayed Peacemaker in The Suicide Squad (both 2021) and in the eponymous television series. His debut studio album, You Can't See Me (2005), was certified platinum. Outside his work in entertainment, Cena is known for his involvement in numerous charitable causes, namely with the Make-A-Wish Foundation, where he has granted the most wishes, at over 650."

Bill frequently acted in features for legendary Grade Z low-budget independent filmmaker Larry Buchanan; said movies include \"The Eye Creatures,\" \"High Yellow,\" \"Zontar the Thing from Venus,\" \"Mars Needs Women,\" \"Curse of the Swamp Creature,\" \"In the Year 2889,\" the especially atrocious \"It's Alive!,\" and \"A Bullet for Pretty Boy.\" Moreover, Thurman had bit parts in two Steven Spielberg films: he's a hillbilly hunter in \"The Sugerland Express\" and an air traffic controller in \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\" Bill's other memorable roles include the abusive Coach Popper in Peter Bogdanovich's magnificent \"The Last Picture Show,\" a doomed hitchhiker in \"Keep My Grave Open,\" a corrupt sheriff in the Claudia Jennings exploitation classic \"'Gatorbait,\" a mean small town deputy in \"Ride in A Pink Car,\" a more amiable sheriff in the fantastic Bigfoot winner \"Creature from Black Lake,\" Cheryl \"Rainbeaux\" Smith's father in \"Slumber Party '57,\" a priest in \"The Evictors,\" and the boozy, dissolute Reverend Bill McWiley in the enjoyably crummy \"Mountaintop Motel Massacre.\" Bill Thurman died in Dallas, Texas on April 13, 1995. - IMDb Mini Biography By: woodyanders"

After graduating from high school he served in the United States Army for four years.\n\nHe began his career as a rapper in the 1980s and was signed to Sire Records in 1987, when he released his debut album Rhyme Pays. The next year, he founded the record label Rhyme Syndicate Records (named after his collective of fellow hip hop artists called the Rhyme Syndicate) and released another album, Power. He co-founded the thrash metal band Body Count, which he introduced in his 1991 album O.G.: Original Gangster. Body Count released its self-titled debut album in 1992. Ice-T encountered controversy over his track \"Cop Killer\", which was perceived to glamorize killing police officers. Ice-T asked to be released from his contract with Warner Bros. Records, and his next solo album, Home Invasion was released later in the Fall of 1993 through Priority Records. Body Count's next album was released in 1994, and Ice-T released two more albums in the late 1990s.

He is one of four siblings; two brothers and a sister. His ancestry consist of Spanish and Scottish origin. Eddie grew up watching a lot of movies with his family. Movies that inspired his imagination and fantasy of becoming an actor/ artist included collections from the Star Wars series, the Indiana Jones series, and the Superman series, with Christopher Reeve. He loved the stories and imagination that these types of movies brought out in him. Eddie attended Cristopher Columbus High School in South Florida where he loved playing sports, but never got involved in theatre until he received an opportunity to audition for the lead role in the play Splender in the Grass, to play Bud Stamper, for the sister school, theater program, at Our Lady of Lourdes Academy. He won the role, and fell in love with the journey, and the process, of performing and storytelling. From that point on, he made the decision to get involved in the acting business."

In the 1980's he turned to stunt coordinating and has worked steadily on both major Hollywood productions, as well as smaller European films, ever since. He may be best remembered by horror fans as the man behind the worm-eyed zombie mask on the poster for Lucio Fulci's ZOMBIE (aka ZOMBI 2) though has possibly the most mainstream exposure in GANGS OF NEW YORK as one of Bill the Butcher's lead henchmen. His only leading roles have been under the name \"Richard Raymond\" for director Bruno Mattei, particularly in 1983's RATS: THE NIGHTS OF TERROR in which he is top-billed. Curiously the same year he appeared in numerous other post-apocalyptic films (RAGE and AFTER THE FALL OF NEW YORK) in which he isn't billed at all."

        "biography": "Gary McLarty (January 16, 1941 \u2013 October 11, 2014) was an American stunt performer and stunt coordinator for film and television. His abilities earned him the nickname \"Whiz Kid\" in Hollywood. McLarty performed stunts in over 150 films between 1966 and 2004, among them The Wild Bunch, Little Big Man, The Longest Yard, Blade Runner, The Terminator, Jurassic Park, Heat, and Collateral.\n\nHe was in the helicopter, as a stunt coordinator, when actor Vic Morrow and two children died in an accident on a \"Twilight Zone\" movie set. In the subsequent trial, McLarty testified that, prior to the accident, he had warned director John Landis that the stunt was too dangerous. In 1991 McLarty shot and killed his roommate. McLarty was cleared of all charges when the Deputy District Attorney determined that it was a clear case of justifiable homicide. On the Friday before as part of a bizarre series of events another man had been fatally shot by Sheriff's deputies at McLarty's Lake View Terrace ranch.  McLarty's house also caught on fire and burned down during the same incident. McLarty semi-retired from stunt work in 2004. The following year, he testified at the murder trial of actor Robert Blake, testifying that Blake offered him $10,000 to murder Blake's wife, Bonnie Lee Bakley; McLarty declined. Bakley was fatally shot in Blake's car outside a restaurant in May 2001. Blake was thought by most to be the actual murderer, but was acquitted in a 2005 criminal trial.\n\nMcLarty died on October 11, 2014 when a pickup truck driven by fellow stuntman Bob Orrison making a U-turn was broadsided by a Jeep Cherokee in Rancho Cordova, California, USA. Both stuntmen were killed instantly. The two persons in the Jeep Cherokee were hospitalized with non-life threatening injuries."

Janene shifted her focus from the competitive horse circuit to attend college in Victoria BC, where she studied Biology and English. She also became a personal trainer, fitness model and began to dabble in mixed martial arts. However, it was through Janene's experience with training animals and horses that helped her transition into her career as a stunt woman by 2005.\n\nIt didn't take long for the rest of her experience as a well-rounded athlete to launch her into her full-fledged career as a well-rounded stunt woman. She has since doubled many of Hollywood's biggest action stars including Angelina Jolie, Jessica Biel, Paula Patton and Carla Gugino.\n\nA highlight in Janene's stunt career was being recognized by her stunt peers in 2011, winning a World Taurus Stunt Award for 'Best Overall Stunt Performed by a Woman' for her action doubling Angelina Jolie in 'Salt'."

Barr released her autobiography in 1989, a second book in 1994, and a third book in 2011. She will star in her own reality TV show on Lifetime, revolving around her family and life on her farm. She hosts a radio show on KCAA on Sundays.\n\nIn 1990, controversy arose when she sang the \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" during a nationally aired baseball game, by singing the song off-key, then spitting and grabbing her crotch. The next year she appeared in People magazine announcing that she was an \"incest survivor\", something her parents and sister publicly denied. Twenty years later Barr and her sister appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show to explain how they felt at the time. She was married to Bill Pentland for 15 years and had three children before divorcing and marrying comedian Tom Arnold four days later. Their marriage lasted for four years, before going through a highly publicized divorce. Barr married her bodyguard in 1995 and had one child before divorcing in 2002. She began dating Johnny Argent in 2003, and now lives in Hawaii.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Roseanne Barr, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia."

Although he won acclaim and major awards for a wide variety of roles, he is best remembered for playing \"tough guys\". In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked him eighth among the Greatest Male Stars of All Time.\n\nIn his first performing role, Cagney danced dressed as a woman in the chorus line of the 1919 revue Every Sailor. He spent several years in vaudeville as a hoofer and comedian until his first major acting role in 1925. He secured several other roles, receiving good reviews before landing the lead in the 1929 play Penny Arcade. After rave reviews for his acting, Warners signed him for an initial $500 a week, three-week contract to reprise his role; this was quickly extended to a seven year contract. Cagney's seventh film, The Public Enemy, became one of the most influential gangster movies of the period. Notable for its famous grapefruit scene, the film thrust Cagney into the spotlight, making him one of Warners' and Hollywood's biggest stars.\n\nIn 1938, he received his first Academy Award Best Actor nomination for Angels with Dirty Faces, before winning in 1942 for his portrayal of George M. Cohan in Yankee Doodle Dandy. He was nominated a third time in 1955 for Love Me or Leave Me. Cagney retired for 20 years in 1961, spending time on his farm before returning for a part in Ragtime mainly to aid his recovery from a stroke.\n\nCagney walked out on Warners several times over his career, each time coming back on improved personal and artistic terms. In 1935, he sued Warners for breach of contract and won; this marked one of the first times an actor had beaten a studio over a contract issue. He worked for an independent film company for a year while the suit was settled, and also established his own production company, Cagney Productions, in 1942 before returning to Warners again four years later. Jack Warner called him \"The Professional Againster\", in reference to Cagney\u2019s refusal to be pushed around. Cagney also made numerous morale-boosting troop tours before and during World War II, and was President of the Screen Actors Guild for two years.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article James Cagney, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia."

        "biography": "Indrans is a Malayalam film actor and costume designer, working mainly in comedy roles. He has appeared in over 250 films. Indrans, a tailor by profession, debuted in the film Choothattam both as a costume designer and as an actor. The producer, TMN Charley, offered him a chance to assist in costume designing. Although he had the opportunity to meet many filmmakers, including evergreen hero Prem Nazir, Sattar, Pappu, Jose Prakash and Jayabharathi, he concentrated on designing costumes for several years in the industry, acting in minor roles on screen. Soon, Indrans started getting cast by well-known directors including Padmarajan, Venu Nagavally, Shaji N. Karun, Sibi Malayil and K. Madhu. CID Unni Krishnan was a turning point in his career. His brand of comedy clicked among the audiences and he went on to become a popular comedian in Kerala, and has worked steadily as an actor. As a comedy actor he has made most use of his slender, lean figure and typical accent to win over the audiences. He created his own style in cinema. Renowned directors Adoor Gopalakrishnan and T.V. Chandran also offered him roles."

Pak, a Korean American, was born in Seoul, South Korea. Not only did he play as the main villain of the first Mortal Kombat game, Shang Tsung, but he also played the Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang for the first game and Mortal Kombat II. He was a stunt coordinator for the movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze as well as a stunt double for Raphael; he later reprised his role of stunt double in the movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III. In 1995, he and fellow MK actors Daniel Pesina, Katalin Zamiar, and Dr. Phillip Ahn, M.D. all appeared in a fighting game produced exclusively for the Atari Jaguar titled Thea Realm Fighters, but it was never released after Atari ceased production on the failed system later that year. In 2003, he played the leading role in the martial arts movie The Book of Swords. In it he portrayed Lang, an Asian cop who after witnessing the death of his brother during a drugbust gone wrong, leaves town only to come back three years later for revenge. The movie also starred MK actors Daniel Pesina, Katalin Zamiar and Richard Divizio. In a nod to his Mortal Kombat alter ego Liu Kang, Pak is shown wearing a red headband during the final part of the movie, while the other three actors are also seen in similar MK clothing/roles throughout the movie. In 2004 Pak starred in the martial film Lesser of Three Evils, directed by Wayne A. Kennedy, also starring Roger Guenveur Smith, Peter Greene, Rosa Blasi and Sherilyn Fenn. The film was produced by Ho-Sung Pak, Wayne A. Kennedy and Matthew Chausse who created together the film company GenOne. It was released in 2009 under the title Fist of the Warrior. During the 1995-1997 show WMAC Masters, his ki-symbol was \"Superstar\", which is a translation of his given Korean name. His older brother, Ho Young Pak (\"Star Warrior\"), as well as fellow Mortal Kombat actors Chris Casamassa (\"Red Dragon\"), Hakim Alston (Machine) and Richard Branden (Yin Yang Man) also appeared on the show.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Ho-Sung Pak, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia."

He not only played football, but he was also a fireman, railroad worker, coal miner, cowpuncher, ranch hand, circus rider, lumberjack, and finally, a day laborer at the studios of D. W. Griffith.\n\nHe had no theatrical experience when he came to the screen. In his first movie, The Birth of a Nation (1915), he was a stuntman and an extra in the movie. In his next movie, he starred in another small part in the movie, Intolerance (1916). Gradually moving to supporting roles for both D. W. Griffith and Cecil B. DeMille, Blue earned his breakthrough role as Danton in Orphans of the Storm, starring sisters, Lillian Gish and Dorothy Gish. Then he rose to stardom as a rugged romantic lead along with top leading actresses such as Clara Bow, Gloria Swanson, and Norma Shearer. His most prolific female screen partner was Marie Prevost with whom he made several films in the mid 20s at Warner Brothers. Blue's finest silent screen performance was as the alcoholic doctor who finds paradise in MGM's White Shadows in the South Seas (1928). Blue became one of the few silent stars to survive the talkie revolution. However, he lost his investments in the stock market crash of 1929.\n\nHe rebuilt his career as a character actor, working until his retirement in 1954. One of his more memorable roles was the sheriff in Key Largo. He divorced his first wife in 1923 and married Tova Jansen in 1924. He had two children, Barbara Ann and Richard Monte. During the later part of his life, Monte Blue was an active Mason and the advance man for the Hamid-Morton Shrine Circus; while on business in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, he had a heart attack because of complications from influenza, dying at age 76.\n\nMonte Blue has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6286 Hollywood Blvd.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Monte Blue, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia."

Rooney in Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), Charles Deetz in Beetlejuice (1988), Dr. Skip Tyler in The Hunt for Red October (1990), Eddie Barzoon in The Devil's Advocate (1997), and A. W. Merrick in both Deadwood (2004\u20132006) and Deadwood: The Movie (2019).\n\nJones was born in Buffalo, New York, and studied acting at the Putney School, the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, and Lawrence University. He began his acting career in small parts in film and television in the 1970s. In his best-known roles as Emperor Joseph II in Amadeus, Charles Deetz in Beetlejuice, and Edward R. Rooney in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, his dead-pan expression and distinctive face bring a comic flavor to his characters through their reactions to the situations in which they find themselves, more so than the wit in their scripted lines.\n\nJones has also had a successful career on stage, appearing in productions of The Crucible, The Importance of Being Earnest, and The Glass Menagerie. He has been nominated for two Tony Awards, for Best Featured Actor in a Play for his performance in The Crucible (1988) and Best Featured Actor in a Musical for his performance in The Secret Garden (1991).\n\nIn 2002, Jones was arrested on charges of child pornography. He pleaded guilty to one count of possession of child pornography and was sentenced to two years of probation. He has not appeared in any major film or television roles since his arrest.\n\nDespite his personal troubles, Jones is still considered to be one of the most talented character actors of his generation"

Notable exceptions were the 2011 Hallmark Channel TV-movie THE SHUNNING and its 2012 sequel THE CONFESSION (in which director Michael Landon Jr. cast Oberst in the film's male lead role of an Amish farmer) and an award-winning turn as General William Tecumseh Sherman in the History Channel's docudrama SHERMAN'S MARCH. Oberst has also toured theatrically in a first-person stage recreation of the teachings of Jesus Of Nazareth and in a string of one-man shows whose subjects included President John F. Kennedy, Mark Twain and humorist Lewis Grizzard. He remains best known as a horror genre actor, however.\n\nBill Oberst Jr.'s trademark piercing star and rough-hewn face have led him to be cast as monsters, murderers, vampires and cannibals, often in minimal wardrobe. His oddly shaped torso and partially-exposed ribcage are almost as recognizable to genre fans as his face. Oberst is often quoted as saying that he believes the human body's capacity to disturb on film is just as strong as its capacity to entice. In 2011, Oberst was seen by over 60 million internet viewers worldwide as the cyber stalker in the Facebook application TAKE THIS LOLLIPOP, (http://www.takethislollipop.com) which broke records to become the fastest-growing application in Facebook history and the most popular horror-themed application in internet history. \n\nIn person, his quiet demeanor and interest in things spiritual seem sharply at odds with the roles he plays. A native Southerner, Oberst is a fulltime actor living in Los Angeles. \n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"

Over the years, the petite actress continuously outshines with her acting skills to transcend into the leading lady.\n\nThe multi-talented actress also made her debut in stage performance in the critically acclaimed Men At Forty-Eight in 1997.  Her acting skill was further recognised when she bagged the Best Actress award in Star Awards \u201999 with her breakthrough performance in Stepping Out where she played a long-suffering woman fighting against her fate. The same role also earned her a nomination in the same category at the Asian Television Awards. She is also one of the first Singaporean actress to ever shave her head for a role.\n\nEffectively bilingual, Cynthia made her cross over to English drama when she was cast in the award-winning local series, Growing Up, which was immediately followed by another lead role in @Moulmein High, a high school drama, making her a huge idol amongst teengers across the island.\n\nTo date, Cynthia has not only handled diversified roles both in Chinese and English, but has also tried her hands at hosting and singing, all, to favourable reviews. A thespian actress, it is little wonder why she is a hot favourite amongst directors and producers alike. She was in two 100-episode long Chinese drama, Holland V and Portrait of Home as leading roles.\n\nHer past productions include The Little Nyonya in 2008, a storyline with a Peranakan setting that spans over 70 years starting from the 1930s which recorded the highest rating in local TV history for the past 15 years. She was also cast in Crescendo, a Singaporean Musical Drama about Xinyao in 2015. And in 2019, Cynthia\u2019s outstanding performance Say Cheese earned her another nomination for Best Supporting Actress in Star Awards 2019 and also in Asia Pacific\u2019s most prestigious Awards for Creative Excellence - Asian Academy Creative Awards."

Training at the Theatre of Arts in London, he started work as an actor, making his West End debut in 1974. He went on to appear in numerous roles in television, including the series I, Claudius and Jesus of Nazareth, before starring as Simon Doyle in the film Death on the Nile. This proved to be a breakthrough role and allowed him to move to the United States, where he appeared in a variety of films and TV series including Quatermass, The Riddle of the Sands, The Sword and the Sorcerer, and Jaws 3-D.\n\nIn 1983, MacCorkindale starred in the short-lived series Manimal as the lead character, Dr. Jonathan Chase, before taking up the longer-running role of lawyer Greg Reardon in Falcon Crest. Throughout the late 1980s and 1990s he directed and produced many stage, TV and film productions through his company Amy International Artists, such as the film Stealing Heaven (1988). Moving to Canada, he starred as Peter Sinclair in the series Counterstrike for three years. He returned to the United Kingdom in 2002 and joined the cast of the BBC medical drama Casualty, appearing in the role of Harry Harper for six years until 2008."

He directed over 80 films between 1925 and 1951, including the 1934 John Wayne film Randy Rides Alone and the Frank Buck cliffhanger serial Jungle Menace (1937). He had a small acting role in the John Wayne film 'Neath the Arizona Skies. He also wrote screenplays, including Chick Carter, Detective (1946).\n\nIn his autobiography, Fraser described filming the scene in Jungle Menace during which a boa constrictor attacks the heroine Dorothy (Charlotte Henry). The villain has tied Dorothy hand and foot and she thrashes about wildly, terrified when she suddenly sees the huge snake:\n\n\"The snake was in no hurry. Slowly he slithered across the girl's body, while she screamed and struggled. He turned, looking for a spot to slip under her to make his first wrap. I motioned to the reptile crew to get ready, and a split-second later gave them the signal to move in. But now, the maddened snake fought them and did its best to coil around one of the men. Before that happened, however, I had cut, and we had a good cliff-hanger with our terror-stricken heroine to close the episode.\"\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Harry L.

Among other notorious works in his career as a filmmaker is \"A Noite do Espantalho\", which shows Ricardo's talent as a polymath by mixing filmmaking with folk music and other elements of Brazilian popular culture, such as \"cordel\" literature.\n\nRicardo moved to the Vidigal slum, in Rio de Janeiro, by choice in the 1970s, where he lived until his death in 2020. \"Bandeira de Retalhos\" (2018), his last film, was adapted by a theatre play also written by him and chronicles the life in 1970s Vidigal."

With the release of \"Universal Magnetic\" (1996), he became an underground favorite in the hip-hop world, leading to his legendary collaboration with Talib Kweli. The two formed Black Star whose debut album, Mos Def and Talib Kweli Are Black Star, would become one of the most critically acclaimed hip-hop albums. He followed with his 1999 solo debut, Black On Both Sides, which was certified gold and credited by critics as bringing hip hop back to its soapbox roots.\n\nHe was a former child actor in television films, sitcoms, and theater, and continued acting as an adult after launching his rap career. He appeared in Spike Lee's Bamboozled, MTV's Carmen: A Hip Hopera, 2002's critically acclaimed Monster's Ball, Showtime, and the 2002 romantic comedy Brown Sugar, for which he received an NAACP Image Award nomination. He hosted Def Poetry Jam from 2002 to 2007.\n\nHe completed his Broadway debut in 2002 in the Tony-nominated, Pulitzer Prize-winning, Topdog/Underdog. He then re-teamed with Topdog playwright, Suzan Lori Parks and director George Wolfe for the off-Broadway play Fucking A, for which he earned an Obie Award.\n\nIn 2003, he starred in The Italian Job alongside Ed Norton, Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron. In 2004, he starred opposite Alan Rickman in the critically acclaimed HBO movie Something the Lord Made, for which he received a 2004 Emmy Nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor In A Miniseries Or A Movie. He was also nominated for both a Golden Globe Award (Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture) and Golden Satellite Award (Best Actor in a Miniseries or a Motion Picture Made for Television) for the same role.\n\nHe continued his music career by releasing his highly anticipated and critically acclaimed sophomore solo release, The New Danger (2004). The first single, \"Sex, Love and Money\" earned him a 2005 Grammy nomination for Best Alternative/Urban Performance, and the album has been certified gold by the RIAA.\n\nThe following year, he appeared alongside Bruce Willis in the crime thriller 16 Blocks (2006), in Dave Chappelle\u2019s Block Party, and had a cameo appearance in Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. Also in 2006, he released his third solo album, True Magic.\n\nThe next year, he appeared in the 2007 PBS historical documentary, Prince Among Slaves, and in 2008 he played the role of Chuck Berry in Cadillac Records. In 2009, he released the album The Ecstatic, which proved to be his second highest-charting album to date. He then appeared in the urban comedy Next Day Air, and (as himself) in the 2010 mockumentary film I\u2019m Still Here, starring Joaquin Phoenix.\n\nMos Def announced in September of 2011 that he changed his name to Yasiin Bey, and would go by it henceforth. In the first month of 2016, Bey declared his retirement from both the film and music industries.\n\nIn 2014, About.com listed him 14th on its \"50 Greatest Rappers of All Time\"."
